25220389|Positive affect scores correlated with the betweenness values of the right orbital frontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- and the right putamen in the positive emotional network ; negative affect scores correlated with the betweenness values of the left OFC and the left amygdala in the negative emotional network .

17699669|Furthermore , during an effortful affective reappraisal task , nondepressed individuals showed an inverse relationship between activation in left ventrolateral PFC and the amygdala that is mediated by the ventromedial PFC -LRB- VMPFC -RRB- .

12167256|In the first study , we examined the effects of amygdala lesions on affective traits in 10 left and 10 right amygdala-damaged patients , 1 patient with bilateral amygdala damage -LRB- SP -RRB- , and 20 control subjects .

10648432|Another subgroup of aggressive patients -LRB- 28 % -RRB- had different left temporal lesions affecting either the amygdala or periamygdaloid structures .

9184662|Surprisingly , the same brain regions within the left hemisphere were significantly less affected even though no differences were observed between the left and right amygdala in the size of Congored-positive A beta deposits .
