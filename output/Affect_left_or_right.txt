25298173|A differential contribution of the right and left amygdalae to affective information processing has been proposed .

25220389|Positive affect scores correlated with the betweenness values of the right orbital frontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- and the right putamen in the positive emotional network ; negative affect scores correlated with the betweenness values of the left OFC and the left amygdala in the negative emotional network .

23228730|Kindling of the right basolateral amygdala profoundly affected spontaneous firing behavior and repetitive discharge characteristics of pyramidal neuronal electrophysiological properties .

19218865|Consistent with proposed specializations of the right and left amygdala in aversive conditioning , we hypothesize that right amygdala-rostral anterior cingulate cortex interactions mediate learning to avoid errors , whereas left error-related amygdala activation underpins detrimental negative affect .

17987064|We explored this hypothesis by mapping the functional coupling of right and left amygdalae in functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired from 19 patients with major depressive disorder and 19 healthy volunteers , each scanned twice -LRB- at baseline and 8 weeks later -RRB- during performance of an implicit facial affect processing task .

17699669|Furthermore , during an effortful affective reappraisal task , nondepressed individuals showed an inverse relationship between activation in left ventrolateral PFC and the amygdala that is mediated by the ventromedial PFC -LRB- VMPFC -RRB- .

12167256|In the first study , we examined the effects of amygdala lesions on affective traits in 10 left and 10 right amygdala-damaged patients , 1 patient with bilateral amygdala damage -LRB- SP -RRB- , and 20 control subjects .

11568425|Differential contribution of right and left amygdala to affective information processing . .

10648432|Another subgroup of aggressive patients -LRB- 28 % -RRB- had different left temporal lesions affecting either the amygdala or periamygdaloid structures .

9766770|Both the patients with schizophrenia and those with affective psychosis had significant left-less-than-right asymmetry of the posterior amygdala-hippocampal complex .

9184662|Surprisingly , the same brain regions within the left hemisphere were significantly less affected even though no differences were observed between the left and right amygdala in the size of Congored-positive A beta deposits .

7576208|Unilateral infusions of lidocaine into the right or left amygdala did not affect acquisition .

7796168|Muscimol injected into the right or left amygdaloid complex differentially affects retention performance following aversively motivated training . .
