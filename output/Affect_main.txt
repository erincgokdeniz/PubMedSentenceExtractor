27092094|We hypothesized that amygdala activation would correlate with trait plasma OT -LRB- anxiolytic effects -RRB- and AVP -LRB- anxiogenic effects -RRB- levels because the amygdala is thought to affect the coordinated release of these neuropeptides following affective experiences .

26803059|The experimental paradigm applied a well-established ToM cartoon task to test functional effects of EFE on the activation of the amygdala and the anterior ToM network during affective ToM judgments .

26803059|The presence of EFE during affective ToM judgments was associated with shorter reaction times as well as increased activation of the right amygdala , most probably located in the basolateral nucleus -LRB- BLA -RRB- , coincident with reduced activation of ToM-related regions of the prefrontal cortex .

25777814|Negative symptoms in schizophrenia show association with amygdala volumes and neural activation during affective processing . .

25777814|We hypothesised that there would be between-group differences in amygdala volume and neural activation patterns during processing of affective stimuli among patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls .

25777814|However , we found a significant negative correlation between emotional blunting and neural activation in the left amygdala during processing of positive affect .

25777814|Our findings implicate the amygdala in a subgroup of negative symptoms in schizophrenia that are characterised by reduced expression with blunted affect and stereotyped thinking .

25713527|They support the hypotheses that the right amygdala is part of a rapid emotional stimulus detection system and the left amygdala is specialized for sustained stimulus evaluation and that the right anterior VLPFC is implicated in the integration of viscerosensory information with affective signals between the bilateral anterior VLPFCs and the bilateral amygdalae .

25703646|Aberrant amygdala reactivity to affective stimuli represents a candidate factor predisposing patients with bipolar disorder -LRB- BD -RRB- to relapse , but it is unclear to what extent amygdala reactivity is state-dependent .

25675509|Importantly , we found that these higher levels of OXTR methylation were also associated with decreased functional coupling of amygdala with regions involved in affect appraisal and emotion regulation .

25675343|Serotonin transporter gene variants are known to interact with stressful life experiences to increase chances of developing affective symptoms , and these same variants have been shown to influence amygdala reactivity to affective stimuli in non-psychiatric populations .

25672976|Nevertheless , neither CRF2 receptor deficiency nor long-term opiate withdrawal affects amygdala CRF or hypothalamus CRF expression , indicating preserved brain stress-coping systems .

25623035|Extended from these previous works , this study examined the functional connectivity of the amygdala in meditation experts during affective processing and observed that these experts had significantly stronger left amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- connectivity with the dorsal ACC -LRB- dACC -RRB- , premotor , and primary somatosensory cortices -LRB- PSC -RRB- while viewing affectively positive stimuli when compared to the novices .

25623035|The current findings have implications for further understanding of affective neuroplastic changes associated with meditation in the amygdala .

25617327|Although intra-basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA ; 1.25 ug/side -RRB- and systemic PROP administration attenuated fear memory in DCS pre-treated ETOH rats , DCS/MDZ treatment did not affect memory in these animals .

25616182|By contrast , PV/PT mainly project to limbic subcortical structures , particularly the amygdala and nucleus accumbens , and hence are critically involved in affective behaviors such as stress/anxiety , feeding behavior , and drug seeking activities .

25581657|Our objective was to study the effects of NTX on alcohol-induced VS activation and on amygdala response to affective stimuli in treatment-seeking alcohol-dependent inpatients .

25577159|In contrast , amygdala volume loss is more pronounced in BPD compared to MDD , yet amygdala volume is associated with affective symptom expression in both disorders .

25573399|Greater differential right amygdala activation to matching fearful v. happy facial expressions related to greater negative affectivity -LRB- i.e. trait anxiety -RRB- and was heightened across all anxiety disorder groups compared with controls .

25569763|vmPFC interacts with a number of subcortical structures involved in affective processing , including the amygdala , hypothalamus , periaqueductal gray , ventral striatum , and bed nucleus of stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- .

25561905|A bioinformatics analysis identified that miR-190b , by targeting an Nrg3-related network , could affect synaptic plasticity in the amygdala , targeting bot impulsive and compulsive traits .

25560201|This suggests that in the healthy brain , interindividual responses to pharmacologically induced and spontaneously occurring fluctuations in -LSB- -LRB- 11 -RRB- C -RSB- SB207145 binding , a putative marker of brain serotonin levels , affect amygdala reactivity to threat .

25556211|This effect appears to have been exacerbated or offset by co-occurring activity in other top-down control regions -LRB- parietal -RRB- and emotion processing regions -LRB- orbitofrontal cortex , amygdala and nucleus accumbens -RRB- as a function of the valence of state affect -LRB- positive or negative -RRB- and trait affect -LRB- trait NA or trait PA -RRB- .

25552571|Connectivity between amygdala and right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex was especially pronounced during cross-task interference from affective features .

25548107|Since functional coupling between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex is implicated in affective processes , it is possible that ? -LRB- 9 -RRB- - tetrahydrocannabinol affects amygdala-prefrontal cortex functional connectivity in ways that differ across amygdala subregions : basolateral , centromedial , and superficial .

25486393|Because common structural abnormalities are present in reward and affective brain regions in alcoholics and those with familial alcoholism , the current study examined the relationship between familial loading of AUDs and volumes of the amygdala and nucleus accumbens -LRB- NAcc -RRB- in largely alcohol-naive adolescents , ages 12-16 years -LRB- N = 140 -RRB- .

25463465|In contrast , only the fALFF in the right amygdala reliably predicted affective well-being .

25463465|Furthermore , emotional intelligence partially mediated the effects of the right pSTG and thalamus on cognitive well-being , as well as the effect of the right amygdala on affective well-being .

25462903|Pubertal timing was affected in neonatal amygdala-lesioned females -LRB- Neo-A -RRB- , such that they experienced significantly earlier menarche and first ovulation than did control females -LRB- Neo-C -RRB- .

25365801|Within regions that showed connectivity with the amygdala as a function of maltreatment , we also evaluated whether amygdala connectivity was associated positively with negative affect and negatively with healthy emotional processing .

25348604|At adulthood they were tested for locomotor , social , and cognitive abilities ; furthermore , dendritic alterations were assessed in the hippocampus and amygdala , two brain regions known to be involved in the control of the examined behaviors and affected by spine pathology in Fmr1-KOs .

25304525|In addition , we observed consistent reductions during painful stimulation in the amygdala and striatum , regions implicated widely in studies of affect and valuation .

25298173|A differential contribution of the right and left amygdalae to affective information processing has been proposed .

25281921|Breathing is affected by dopamine D2-like receptors in the basolateral amygdala . .

25281921|We investigated whether basal dopamine release occurs in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , where sensory-related inputs are received and lead to fear or anxiety responses , and whether D1 - and D2-like receptor antagonists affect breathing patterns and dopamine release in the BLA .

25280904|Mature amygdala-prefrontal circuitry regulates affect in adulthood but shows protracted development .

25280788|These results demonstrate that the neuroanatomical and neurochemical properties of glutamatergic neurons in the rat amygdala are adversely affected by repeated stress and suggest that the therapeutic effects of agomelatine may include protection of structural and neurochemical plasticity in limbic structures like the amygdala .

25261341|N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonism and antagonism within the amygdaloid central nucleus suppresses pain affect : differential contribution of the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray . .

25257105|We investigate whether histamine itself , and histaminergic compounds given into the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- immediately post-training can affect retention -LRB- 24 h after training -RRB- of one-trial -LRB- IA -RRB- in rats submitted to early postnatal maternal deprivation .

25253281|The alleged association between the serotonin-transporter-linked polymorphic region -LRB- 5-HTTLPR -RRB- and amygdala activation forms a cornerstone of the common view that carrying the short allele of this polymorphism is a potential risk factor for affective disorders .

25234225|Research has suggested that differences in dopaminergic system activity in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex may be one of the biological factors that underlie individual differences in response to fear stimuli , which may also affect the rewarding effects of amphetamine .

25231241|Independent of time , larger hippocampal volumes were associated with higher PA , and negative affect was associated with smaller left amygdala volume .

25227250|None of the three peptides injected into the amygdala affected memories critically engaging this region .

25222701|Globally , low -LRB- early follicular and the entire follicular phase for estrogen and progesterone , respectively -RRB- and high -LRB- COC , CSHT , late follicular and luteal phase for estrogen ; COC , mid - and late-luteal phase for progesterone -RRB- hormonal milieu diversely affected the response of several brain regions including the amygdala , anterior cingulate cortex , and inferior frontal gyrus , but their functional recruitment across groups and domains was scattered .

25220389|Positive affect scores correlated with the betweenness values of the right orbital frontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- and the right putamen in the positive emotional network ; negative affect scores correlated with the betweenness values of the left OFC and the left amygdala in the negative emotional network .

25172408|Our results show that activity levels of left subgenual anterior cingulate gyrus -LRB- ACG -RRB- , right amygdala , left Brodmann area 10 -LRB- orbitofrontal cortex -RRB- , and right thalamus were inversely correlated with BRACHA scores and were activated with frustrative non-reward during the affective Posner Task .

25172408|In addition , 11 TNF related gene expressions were significantly correlated with activation of amygdala or ACG during the affective Posner Task .

25162644|Xe inhibits glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- receptors involved in learning and memory and can affect synaptic plasticity in the amygdala and hippocampus , two brain areas known to play a role in fear conditioning models of post-traumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- .

25162634|The amygdala and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- sACC -RRB- are key brain regions for the generation of negative affect .

25162634|In this longitudinal fMRI study of adolescents we investigated how amygdala-sACC connectivity was correlated with negative affectivity -LRB- NA -RRB- both cross-sectionally and longitudinally , and examined its relationship to the onset of first-episode depression .

25128711|Negative valence affected functional connectivity of fronto-parietal , limbic -LRB- insula , cingulum -RRB- and fronto-opercular circuitries , and positive arousal affected the connectivity of the striatum , amygdala , thalamus , cerebellum , and dorsal frontal cortex .

25119145|Together with our previous finding of amygdala hyperactivity in bipolar patients during verbal rehearsal , the present results suggest that a disturbed right-hemispheric '' cognitive-emotional '' interaction between the amygdala and cortical brain regions underlying working memory may be responsible for amygdala hyperactivation and affects verbal working memory -LRB- deficits -RRB- in bipolar patients .

25113955|Right thalamic sub-region projecting to amygdala and left thalamic sub-region projecting to motor cortex were also affected in DLB compared to controls .

25111474|Further , dlPFC connectivity to other brain regions -LRB- e.g. ventromedial PFC , amygdala , and insula -RRB- varied with negative affect -LRB- i.e. trait anxiety -RRB- when the UCS was predictable , suggesting that stronger connectivity may be required for emotion regulation in individuals with higher levels of negative affect .

25069080|Differential abnormalities of functional connectivity of the amygdala and hippocampus in unipolar and bipolar affective disorders . .

25069080|The amygdala and hippocampus - two structures intimately associated with mood and cognition - have been reported to exhibit altered neural activity or volume in affective disorders .

25069080|During a simple cognitive task , the functional connectivity of the amygdala and hippocampus , regions usually associated with emotion and memory regulation , was substantially different in affective illness compared to healthy controls whether or not there were baseline abnormalities in these areas .

25057193|Although behavioral and imaging data suggest that these brain regions are affected by advanced age , the extent to which aging alters appetitive processes coordinated by the OFC and the amygdala is unknown .

25043736|The functional profile of the human amygdala in affective processing : insights from intracranial recordings . .

25043736|The amygdala is suggested to serve as a key structure in the emotional brain , implicated in diverse affective processes .

25043736|We conducted a systematic literature review of 47 iEEG studies investigating the human amygdala , and we focus on two content-related domains and one process-related domain : -LRB- 1 -RRB- memory formation and retrieval ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- affective processing ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- latency components .

25043736|The review highlights the amygdala 's role in emotion processing witnessed in differential treatment of social-affective facial cues , differential neuronal firing to relevant novel stimuli , and habituation to familiar affective stimuli .

25043736|Overall , the review suggests the amygdala plays a key role in the processing of affective relevance .

25042548|Neonatal amygdalectomy did not affect social discriminative abilities and mother preference at 3 and 6 months of age , strongly suggesting that the amygdala is not involved in the cognitive processes underlying the development of filial attachment at least when the amygdala damage occurred after the third to fourth weeks of age .

25034314|These transitions coincide with changes in amygdala response to social and affective stimuli .

25027503|Lobe-based and voxel-based analysis confirmed that tasks requiring interpretation of emotions and intentions at more basic -LRB- less mentalized -RRB- levels -LRB- Tasks 1 and 2 -RRB- were more affected by temporo/insular lesions , with emotion recognition -LRB- Task 1 -RRB- being maximally impaired by anterior temporal and amygdala lesions and Task 2 -LRB- found to be a ` basic ' Theory of Mind task involving only limited mentalization -RRB- being mostly impaired by posterior temporoparietal lesions .

25026154|Superficial amygdala and hippocampal activity during affective music listening observed at 3 T but not 1.5 T fMRI . .

25026154|The findings raise concern over false negatives in the superficial amygdala and hippocampus in affective studies conducted under 1.5 T and caution that imaging improvements due to increasing magnetic field strength can be influenced by region-specific characteristics .

24976929|On the other hand , other brain regions were differently impaired in affective and non-affective psychosis : alterations of cingulate cortex and thalamus seemed to be more common in Schizophrenia and amygdala dysfunctions in BDI .

24972588|Case report : stimulation of the right amygdala induces transient changes in affective bias . .

24972588|This study examined the utility of a novel affective bias -LRB- AB -RRB- task in identifying transient mood changes induced by amygdala stimulation in a single rare participant .

24968059|The DNMT1 , DNMT3a , and DNMT3b mRNA expression in the amygdala was not affected by either 1or 2 doses of 2 g/kg .

24958494|Influence of DGKH variants on amygdala volume in patients with bipolar affective disorder and schizophrenia . .

24923983|Seed-based functional MR imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- identified increased strength of connectivity within and between '' limbic '' and '' cortical '' loops , with affected cross-correlations between amygdala , NAcc and Hip .

24899761|Localized declines for myelin and axonal measures appeared in the dorsal and ventral medulla , cerebellar cortex and deep nuclei , basal ganglia , hippocampus , amygdala , corpus callosum , insula , cingulate and medial frontal cortices , and other cortical areas -LRB- P < 0.005 -RRB- , all regions mediating functions affected in OSA .

24884791|Explicit , implicit and passive processing of affective stimuli are known to activate the amygdalae differently reflecting differences in attention , level of detailed analysis of the stimuli and the cognitive control needed to perform the required task .

24884791|Previous studies revealed that implicit processing or passive viewing of affective stimuli , induce a left amygdala response that correlates with HA .

24884791|Our results indicate that the left amygdala response to explicit processing of affective stimuli does correlate with HA .

24862171|Task-evoked amygdala activation and task-free amygdala connectivity within the salience network were not related to each other , suggesting that resting-state and task-evoked dynamic brain imaging measures may provide independent and complementary information about affective experience , and likely other kinds of behaviors as well .

24858795|Correlations between self-reported ES and brain responses to the facial affect stimuli -LRB- affective > neutral -RRB- were evaluated within the brain regions involved in emotional processing , including the amygdala , insula , anterior cingulate cortex , medial prefrontal cortex , and orbitofrontal cortex .

24847420|Neither amisulpride nor fluphenazine affected neurotensin contents in the amygdala or hippocampus .

24816735|Previous studies have shown that the activity of the amygdala is elevated in people experiencing clinical and subclinical levels of anxiety and depression -LRB- negative affect -RRB- .

24816735|Prior studies have found relationships between negative affect and 1 -RRB- amygdala over-activity and 2 -RRB- reduced amygdala-prefrontal connectivity .

24816735|However , it is not known whether elevated amygdala activity is associated with decreased amygdala-prefrontal connectivity during negative affect states .

24813437|Individuals with SP as a whole exhibited a reversal of the pattern observed in healthy controls in that they showed upregulation of amygdala activity during affect labeling .

24802075|Related to affective ToM , psychopaths had hypoactivation in amygdala , inferior prefrontal gyrus and superior temporal sulcus , areas associated with embodied simulation of emotions and intentions .

24802075|Furthermore , psychopaths lacked connectivity between superior temporal sulcus and amygdala during affective ToM .

24800964|However neither genotype nor drug withdrawal affect the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in the ventral tegmental area or the locus coeruleus and CRF in the central nucleus of the amygdala or the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus , brain regions implicated in stress and drug responses .

24769166|A region-of-interest analysis detected increased activation for NH controls in the right amygdala when responding to affective stimuli , but failed to find a similar heightened response in the TIN and HL groups .

24769166|Our results suggest that the emotional processing network is altered in tinnitus to rely on the parahippocampus and insula , rather than the amygdala , and this alteration may maintain a select advantage for the rapid processing of affective stimuli despite the hearing loss .

24768696|However choline acetyltransferase levels were only affected in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus and both , choline acetyltransferase and c-Fos expression levels were decreased in the amygdala .

24760033|The lateralized amygdala affective processing linked with the temperament dimension Harm Avoidance -LRB- HA -RRB- remains poorly understood .

24760033|Females scoring higher on HA displayed stronger left amygdala rsFC with ventromedial prefrontal cortical -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- regions involved in affective disturbances .

24760033|In high HA scorers , we also observed stronger right amygdala rsFC with the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- dmPFC -RRB- , which is implicated in negative affect regulation .

24754353|A common microdeletion affecting a hippocampus - and amygdala-specific isoform of tryptophan hydroxylase 2 is not associated with affective disorders . .

24754353|PEM led to the identification of a microdeletion in the gene encoding tryptophan hydroxylase 2 -LRB- TPH2 -RRB- , affecting an amygdala - and hippocampus-specific isoform .

24753197|Previous studies in clinical populations have shown that hippocampus and amygdala , two central structures of limbic emotion processing circuits , are predominantly affected by early stress exposure .

24752649|Here we examined whether maltreatment also alters bdnf DNA methylation in two additional regions known to be prominently affected by diverse forms of early life adversity in humans - the hippocampus and amygdala .

24737710|The authors used Granger causality methods to evaluate task-based directional connectivity between medial or lateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- and amygdala in 20 unmedicated patients with current major depressive disorder -LRB- MDD -RRB- and 19 healthy matched controls while participants engaged in an affective variant of the flanker task comparing response to sad and neutral faces .

24723867|Early work on the amygdala placed this small structure as a key component in the regulation of emotion and affective behavior .

24723854|Modulation of their activity is thus thought to affect amygdala output and the generation of fear and anxiety .

24719001|These are : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the deactivation of the default mode network that generates spontaneous thoughts , contributes to the maintenance of the autobiographical self and is associated with anxiety and depression ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the anterior cingulate cortex that underpins attention functions ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- the anterior insula associated with the perception of visceral sensation , the detection of heartbeat and respiratory rate , and the affective response to pain ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- the posterior cingulate cortex which helps to understand the context from which a stimulus emerges ; -LRB- 5 -RRB- the temporoparietal junction which assumes a central role in empathy and compassion ; -LRB- 6 -RRB- the amygdala implicated in fear responses .

24698766|In the present study , we assessed how APOE genotype affects synaptic integrity of amygdala neurons by comparing electrophysiological and morphometric properties in human apoE3 , E4 , and E2/4 TR mice at the age of 18-20 months .

24681006|Cumulating evidence suggests that action monitoring is modulated by trait anxiety and negative affect , and that activity of the dMFC and the amygdala during action monitoring might contribute to the ` affective tagging ' of actions along a valence dimension .

24673881|Leading neurocircuitry models of these disorders propose that hypoactivity in the vmPFC engenders disinhibited activity of the amygdala and , consequently , pathologically elevated levels of negative affect .

24672018|These findings , which parallel those of research on self-interested economic decision-making , support the hypothesis that the amygdala provides an affective assessment of the action in question , whereas the vmPFC integrates that signal with a utilitarian assessment of expected outcomes to yield '' all things considered '' moral judgments .

24669790|The face of negative affect : trial-by-trial corrugator responses to negative pictures are positively associated with amygdala and negatively associated with ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity . .

24668615|We therefore tested whether basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- lesions would affect risk preference for gains or losses in rats .

24668615|Given the importance of the amygdala in representing negative affect , the aversive emotional reaction to loss , rather than aberrant estimations of probability or loss magnitude , may underlie risk seeking for losses .

24663011|These findings prompted us to hypothesize that a deficiency of GAD65 , the GAD isoform controlling the availability of GABA as a transmitter , affects synaptic transmission and plasticity in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- , and thereby interferes with fear responsiveness .

24662579|Functional connections -LRB- FC -RRB- between the amygdala and cortical and subcortical regions underlie a range of affective and cognitive processes .

24646887|When children used cognitive reappraisal to minimize their experience of negative affect after viewing sad stimuli they exhibited dampened amygdala responses .

24641515|Chemosensory cues affect amygdaloid neurogenesis and alter behaviors in the socially monogamous prairie vole . .

24619244|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- plays a key role in many affective behaviors , and repeated stress causes different forms of BLA hyperactivity in adolescent and adult rats .

24613174|We focused on a network of ventral brain regions involved in affective processing of social information : the amygdala , anterior insula , nucleus accumbens , and subgenual anterior cingulate , as well as the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex .

24613174|However , longer durations of maternal negative affect were associated with decreased responsivity to peer acceptance in the amygdala , left anterior insula , subgenual anterior cingulate , and left nucleus accumbens .

24607266|Previous studies have shown that the amygdala -LRB- AMG -RRB- plays a role in how affective signals are processed .

24603023|These results suggest that intensity and valence of emotional events as well as anxiety levels promote local changes in amygdala sensitivity to threat , highlighting the importance of past experience in shaping future affective reactivity .

24600410|Although the directionality of connections between regions can not be inferred from temporal correlations , the reduced intrinsic connectivity of the amygdala predominantly with regions involved in emotional processing may reflect impaired bottom-up signaling for top-down cortical modulation of limbic regions leading to abnormal affect regulation in MDD .

24593820|The FreeSurfer analysis showed a significant difference in the amygdala volumes between the affected and nonaffected sides .

24583373|How the amygdala affects emotional memory by altering brain network properties . .

24574071|Functional neuroimaging data suggest that the underlying neural substrate involves hyperactivation in the amygdala to affective facial stimuli , and altered activation in the anterior cingulate , inferior frontal gyrus and the superior temporal sulcus particularly during social emotion processing tasks .

24572042|Although amygdala activation is generally linked to negative affect , increased amygdala reactivity to aversive stimuli in the luteal phase has not been consistently reported in PMDD .

24569013|Thus , the present study aimed to clarify whether the functional impairment related to large amygdala activation affects ROEs , in a neurotoxic lesion procedure .

24550802|Social instability stress differentially affects amygdalar neuron adaptations and memory performance in adolescent and adult rats . .

24550791|This was reflected in the brain activation patterns , with the NH group employing the expected limbic and auditory regions including the left amygdala , left parahippocampus , right middle temporal gyrus and left superior temporal gyrus to a greater extent in processing affective stimuli when compared to the HL group .

24496074|Semiquantitative analysis of CB1 expression focused on the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- , prelimbic cortex , dorsal hippocampus -LRB- DH -RRB- , basolateral amygdala complex -LRB- BLA -RRB- , and ventral hippocampus -LRB- VH -RRB- , all areas with high CB1 densities that are strongly affected by neuropathology in 3 × Tg-AD mice .

24493847|First , in a within-participant analysis , lower levels of self-reported negative affect on a given trial were associated with recruitment of dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- - brain regions also active during instructed reappraisal-whereas higher levels of negative affect were associated with recruitment of the amygdala-a region that responded more strongly overall to negative than neutral stimuli .

24489683|We suggest that this effect relates to a relatively early affective response , reminiscent of increased amygdala response reported in NC patients .

24478669|However , it is not known whether amygdala damage affects emotional memory performance at immediate and delayed recall , and whether its involvement is modulated by stimulus valence .

24478669|We investigated these questions in a group of patients with Alzheimer 's disease -LRB- AD -RRB- , which affects the amygdala , hippocampus and neocortical regions .

24405846|This affects the salience of different stimuli , facilitates learning , and likely involves the amygdala .

24396006|However , during affect labeling , the ASD group showed increased activation in the amygdala compared with controls , while the KS group showed increased activation in frontal areas compared with both controls and the ASD group .

24376837|In addition , our data identify preFrontal cortex and amygdala as the most affected brain areas and confirm the highest susceptibility of brain serotonin metabolism to mildly elevated blood PHE .

24368626|An early stress experience such as maternal separation may increase activity in the amygdala -LRB- as pointed by the increased activity of Na -LRB- + -RRB- , K -LRB- + -RRB- - ATPase -RRB- , affecting behaviors related to fear in adulthood , and this effect could be task-specific .

24366718|Alterations in circuits involving the amygdala have been repeatedly implicated in schizophrenia neuropathology , given their role in stress , affective salience processing , and psychosis onset .

24352685|We hypothesize that the variability in amygdala RSFC observed in the present study could potentially link neuroticism and extraversion to the neurobiology underlying increased susceptibility or resilience to affective disorders .

24348366|A decrease of positive affect -LRB- PA -RRB- correlated with response amplitudes in bilateral insular clusters extending into the amygdala to prolonged inactive phases in a game play and an increase in negative affect -LRB- NA -RRB- was associated with higher responses in bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- .

24298153|Hence , stress may leave its mark in the amygdala by generating new synapses with greater capacity for plasticity , thereby creating an ideal neuronal substrate for affective disorders .

24241476|It is overactive and dysregulated in affective and anxiety disorders and amygdala activity normalizes with successful therapy of the symptoms .

24231734|The affected brain regions may include the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , where plasticity of glutamatergic synapses in principal neurons plays a role in conditioned emotional responses .

24231353|Rodent models implicate amygdala prodynorphin -LRB- Pdyn -RRB- as a mediator of negative affect ; however , evidence of PDYN involvement in human negative affect is limited .

24223175|It suggests that the rACC may constitute a promising target for rtfMRI-nf training along with the amygdala in patients with affective disorders , particularly posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- .

24211699|Emotional events are often remembered better than neutral events , a type of memory prioritization by affective salience that depends on the amygdala .

24198772|These results suggest that 5-HTTLPR genetic variation modulates amygdala connectivity which subsequently affects its activity during mood regulation , providing an additional mechanism by which the S allele confers depression risk .

24170933|We were particularly interested in investigating patterns of activity in insula , given its significant role in affective integration , and in amygdala , given its association with appraisal of aversive stimuli and its frequent coactivation with insula .

24148307|In this study , we micro-infused ghrelin or nesfatin-1 into the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- or area CA1 of the dorsal hippocampus -LRB- CA1 -RRB- and investigated the immediate effects of those two peptide hormones on cognitive and affective behaviors .

24139023|For children , performance on cognitive items was positively correlated with amygdala volume , but for adults , only performance on affective items was positively correlated with amygdala volume .

24138639|FAAH Km values are significantly affected by time of day in PFC , hippocampus and amygdala and FAAH Vmax values are significantly affected in PFC , hippocampus and cerebellum .

24128307|Collectively , these findings indicate that the reliability of the BOLD MR signal in the amygdala varies substantially by facial affect .

24121128|The values of mature-BDNF in the amygdala of all the three conditioned groups were higher than those observed for truncated - and pro-BDNF -LRB- p < 0.05 -RRB- , which indicates that the activation of this protein in the amygdala was not affected by the infusion of Ani in the hippocampus .

24115918|Mothers ' amygdala response to positive or negative infant affect is modulated by personal relevance . .

The increased levels of the amygdala MR protein after two hours of restraint , that we analyzed by western blot , negatively correlate with miR-135a and miR-124 expression .

24011821|Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 activation was not significantly affected in the amygdala and increased in the medial prefrontal cortex by CVS .

23996276|Densities were significantly greater in amygdala , entorhinal cortex -LRB- EC -RRB- , and sectors CA2/CA3 of the hippocampus , whereas middle frontal gyrus , sector CA1 , and dentate gyrus were least affected .

23994597|DAMGO in the central amygdala alleviates the affective dimension of pain in a rat model of inflammatory hyperalgesia . .

23994597|We hypothesized that systemic morphine before a post-conditioning test would more potently attenuate the affective aspect compared to the sensory component and that -LSB- d-Ala2-N-Me-Phe4 , Gly-ol5 -RSB- - enkephalin -LRB- DAMGO -RRB- , a ?-selective opioid receptor agonist , injected into the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- would reduce established CPA .

23946692|These results suggest that citalopram may affect c-Fos expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis distinctively and raise the possibility that upregulation of c-Fos in the ventral lateral septum and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray before the test swim may be one of the probable common mechanisms underlying antidepressant effect in the FST .

23940666|-LRB- 1 -RRB- Before the establishment of the SNI-induced neuropathic pain model of rats , lesion of the amygdaloid complex with stereotaxic injection of ibotenic acid -LRB- IBO -RRB- alleviated mechanical allodynia significantly at days 7 and 14 , even no mechanical allodynia at day 28 after SNI ; Lesion of the BLA , but not the CeA had similar effects ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- however , 7 days after SNI when the neuropathic pain model was established , lesion of the amygdala complex or the BLA or the CeA , mechanical allodynia was not affected .

23937887|The amygdala plays a key role in the emotional-affective component of pain , pain modulation and affective disorders .

23929546|Further research is needed to investigate how differences in functional connectivity of amygdala complexes affect target regions that govern behavior , cognition , and affect in PTSD .

23914157|As a result , the circuits in amygdala could be drawn more elaborately , and it led us to understand how fear or extinction memories are formed in the detailed circuit level , and various neuromodulators affect these circuit activities , inducing subtle behavioral changes .

23911256|Schizophrenia patients revealed stronger right amygdala activation during negative and attenuated response during positive affective picture processing compared to healthy controls .

23908624|Depression involves a dysfunction in an affective fronto-limbic circuitry including the prefrontal cortices , several limbic structures including the cingulate cortex , the amygdala , and the hippocampus as well as the basal ganglia .

23908624|It is proposed that the amygdala serves as a gateway by articulating the mood regulatory sensorimotor stimulation with the central affective circuitry by emotionally labeling and mediating the storage of such emotional events in long-term memory .

23899995|In rats with breeding-induced low PPI neuregulin -LRB- NRG1 -RRB- methylation was significantly decreased in brain regions associated with this phenotype and with schizophrenia , i.e. , the medial prefrontal cortex , the nucleus accumbens , and the ventral hippocampus , while methylation in the amygdala and dorsal hippocampus was less affected .

23899240|Fatherhood significantly reduced cell survival -LRB- assessed by bromodeoxyuridine labeling -RRB- , but not cell proliferation -LRB- assessed by Ki67-labeling -RRB- , in the amygdala , dentate gyrus of the hippocampus , and ventromedial hypothalamus , suggesting that fatherhood affects brain plasticity .

23889589|Quantitative FLAIR analysis indicates predominant affection of the amygdala in antibody-associated limbic encephalitis . .

23889589|Furthermore , the method provides an interesting insight into the distinct properties of these two disease entities on MRI , indicating a predominant affection of the amygdala in limbic encephalitis , whereas the affection of the hippocampus is far less pronounced when compared to hippocampal sclerosis .

23887817|The amygdala plays a central role in processing facial affect , responding to diverse expressions and features shared between expressions .

23887817|Our results suggest a convergent representation of facial affect in the amygdala reflecting feature-based processing of discrete expressions .

23883857|Thus NPS is a novel tool to control amygdala output and pain-related affective behaviors through a direct action on inhibitory ITC cells .

23880959|Previous findings of differences in amygdala volume between healthy controls and patients with SZ , BD or OCD diverge with respect to the affected hemisphere , size and direction of the effect .

23871361|Thus , it is likely that consecutive 15 min is necessary for LFS to inhibit amygdaloid-kindling seizures in rats , indicating the stimulation duration may be a key fact affecting the clinical effect of LFS on epilepsy .

23844175|However , the prefrontal cortex , amygdala , and temporal poles were found to be affected differently by major depression and schizophrenia .

23838294|In particular , depression and suicide are neurobiological kinds characterized by disturbances in serotonin functioning that affect various brain areas -LRB- i.e. , the amygdala , anterior cingulate , prefrontal cortex , and hippocampus -RRB- .

23824490|These studies converge in support of the proposal that affective empathy -- making inferences about how another person feels -- engages at least the following areas : prefrontal cortex , orbitofrontal gyrus , anterior insula , anterior cingulate cortex , temporal pole , amygdala and temporoparietal junction .

23818882|Particularly interesting is the recent accumulating evidence that sensitized extrahypothalamic stress systems -LSB- e.g. , hyperglutamatergic activity , blunted hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal -LRB- HPA -RRB- hormonal levels , altered corticotropin-releasing factor signaling , and altered glucocorticoid receptor signaling in the extended amygdala -RSB- are evident in withdrawn dependent rats , supporting the hypothesis that pathological neuroadaptations in the extended amygdala contribute to the negative affective state .

23804084|Here , we demonstrate that sleep loss amplifies preemptive responding in the amygdala and anterior insula during affective anticipation in humans , especially for cues with high predictive certainty .

23800487|In addition , relationships between increased amygdala activity during face processing and disruptions in parent-reported emotion regulation and negative affect were found .

23800481|Some mechanisms that contribute to poor ER in ASD may be shared with other clinical populations -LRB- e.g. , physiologic arousal , degree of negative and positive affect , alterations in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex -RRB- , whereas other mechanisms may be more unique to ASD -LRB- e.g. , differences in information processing/perception , cognitive factors -LSB- e.g. , rigidity -RSB- , less goal-directed behavior and more disorganized emotion in ASD -RRB- .

23791934|Serotonergic neurons projecting from the DRN to the amygdala facilitate learned anxiety producing an anxiogenic effect , while those projecting from the periaqueductal grey affect innate anxiety producing a panicolytic effect .

23776864|Past reports suggested brain magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- abnormalities in CAH patients , affecting white matter signal , temporal lobe and amygdala structure and function .

23774393|Four brain regions were used to model affect labeling , including right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- vlPFC -RRB- , amygdala and Broca 's area .

23756609|This study focuses on the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , a brain region that has been implicated in negative affective states upon withdrawal from chronic cocaine use .

23751519|However , it can not be totally excluded that the injected solutions did not also affect neighboring amygdalar regions .

23748930|Since chronic stress in rodents affects GR expression in the amygdala , altered GR protein level in depressed versus healthy controls can be expected .

23735583|Exploratory analysis suggests that greater connectivity of the right amygdala within the affective network is associated with better executive function in children with bipolar disorder , but not in controls .

23735583|Dual engagement of the dorsal ACC in affective and executive networks supports the neuroanatomical interface of these networks , and the amygdala 's engagement in moderating executive function illustrates the intricate interplay of these neural operations at rest .

23732229|By testing the behavioral effects of SSRI treatment on Pavlovian fear conditioning , a well characterized model of emotional learning , we have the opportunity to identify how SSRIs affect the functioning of specific brain regions , including the amygdala , bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- and hippocampus .

23726779|Results demonstrated altered affective processing of happy and fearful stimuli in bipolar participants in the amygdala , anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- relative to controls .

23703938|It affected areas such as the coeruleus-subcoeruleus complex , dorsal raphae , hypothalamus and amygdala ipsilateral and , to a lesser extent , contralateral to the injection side .

23693003|A risk variant for alcoholism in the NMDA receptor affects amygdala activity during fear conditioning in humans . .

23688672|The goal of the present study is to characterize the amygdala response to affective stimuli by disentangling the contributions of arousal and valence .

23671038|Regionally specific intercorrelations between the opioid and serotonin tracers were found in anteromedial thalamus , amygdala , anterior cingulate cortex , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , and left parietal cortex , i.e. , in areas relevant for several neuropsychiatric disorders , especially affective disorders .

23657281|Although interactions between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- are critical for emotional guidance of behavior , the manner in which amygdala affects PFC function is not clear .

23656557|It aims to highlight how neurobiological findings from these paediatric endocrine disorders can provide insight into the contribution of sex steroids with respect to the development of neurocircuitry involved in affective processing -LRB- amygdala , hippocampus -RRB- and cognitive control -LRB- prefrontal cortex , inferior frontal gyrus , striatum -RRB- .

23653594|Different patterns of amygdala priming differentially affect dentate gyrus plasticity and corticosterone , but not CA1 plasticity . .

23645370|Previous research indicates that psychological stress affects amygdala activity , but it is less clear how painful stressors influence subsequent amygdala functional connectivity .

23645308|We examined whether female pheromone , which would be contained in female-soiled bedding , affected the expression of phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein-like -LRB- pCREB -RRB- immunoreactive cells in the extended amygdala .

23641204|However , the interaction between partner aggression and the anxious temperament of the female affected the expression of avpr1a in the amygdala .

23635407|The goal of our study was to evaluate the effects of emotion on picture recognition in patients affected by Alzheimer 's disease , and to explore the link between this effect and the degree of amygdalar and hippocampal atrophy .

23623989|Altogether , the results of our study show that folate deficiency affects NGF levels in the frontal cortex , amygdala and hippocampus .

23611261|Alcohol-dependent rats displayed increased alcohol self-administration , negative affective-like behavior , DYN A-like immunoreactivity , and KOR signaling in the amygdala compared with nondependent control rats .

23593185|Thus , our findings highlight the function of the amygdala in the affective component of theory of mind -LRB- ToM -RRB- and in empathy , and provide further evidence that men are substantially less able to infer mental states expressed by women , which may be accompanied by sex-specific differences in amygdala activity .

23592753|Impact of sleep quality on amygdala reactivity , negative affect , and perceived stress . .

23592753|Here , we investigate the influence of self-reported sleep quality on associations between threat-related amygdala reactivity and measures of negative affect and perceived stress .

23592753|This study provides novel evidence that self-reported sleep quality moderates the relationships between amygdala reactivity , negative affect , and perceived stress , particularly among men .

23588198|Our goal was to study whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor -LRB- BDNF -RRB- and glial-derived neurotrophic factor -LRB- GDNF -RRB- expression were affected by alcohol in central extended amygdala -LRB- CEXA -RRB- and pyriform cortex -LRB- Pyr -RRB- , structures strongly involved in emotional/social behaviors .

23584670|Convergent evidence shows that alcohol exerts its effects on social behavior via modulation of amygdala reactivity to affective stimuli .

23584670|Given that affective processing involves dynamic interactions between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- , alcohol 's effects are likely to extend beyond regional changes in brain activity to changes that manifest on a broader functional circuit level .

23576810|An increase in positive affective ratings correlated with activity in the amygdala , hippocampus and the fusiform gyrus -LRB- FFG -RRB- , whereas reduced positive affect correlated with activity of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex .

23570794|Priming stimulation of basal but not lateral amygdala affects long-term potentiation in the rat dentate gyrus in vivo . .

23570794|We found that while priming stimulation of the lateral amygdala did not affect LTP of the dentate gyrus , priming stimulation of the basal amygdala enhanced the LTP response when the priming stimulation was relatively weak , but impaired it when it was relatively strong .

23563851|Specifically , because negative affective styles have been associated with increased amygdala activation to negative stimuli , it may be happy people will not show this enhanced response , and may even show reduced amygdala activation to negative stimuli .

23562065|Cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation affects seizures and cognition in fully amygdala-kindled rats . .

23562065|The findings suggest that cathodal tDCS has anticonvulsive after-effects last at least for one day on the amygdala-kindled rats and positively affects cognitive performance .

23551217|Our data suggest that the efficacy of DCS in neuropsychiatric disorders may be partly due to its ability to affect neuronal activity and signaling in the mPFC and amygdala subnuclei .

23551164|Rs-fc between 5 affective regions -LRB- anterior cingulate cortex , right/left anterior insula , and right/left amygdala -RRB- with the rest of the brain was determined .

23551164|Functional connections with affective pain regions that differed in CM and controls included regions in anterior insula , amygdala , pulvinar , mediodorsal thalamus , middle temporal cortex , and periaqueductal gray .

23538069|Chronic stress may contribute to affective disorders such as depression and anxiety via its effects on the amygdala .

23538069|However , whether these distinct changes in amgydala neuronal activity are accompanied by age-dependent changes in amygdala-dependent affective behavior is unclear .

23530896|Antidrug PSAs compared with nondrug ads more strongly elicited arousal-related activity in the amygdala and medial pFC. Within antidrug PSAs , those that were prerated as strongly persuasive versus weakly persuasive showed significant differences in arousal-related activity in executive processing areas of the lateral pFC. In support of the notion that persuasiveness involves both affective and executive processes , functional connectivity analyses showed greater coactivation between the lateral pFC and amygdala during PSAs known to be strongly -LRB- vs. weakly -RRB- convincing .

23526151|We hypothesized that serotonin transporter-linked promoter region -LRB- 5-HTTLPR -RRB- genotype affects change in amygdala response to repeated sad faces differently in individuals with ASD vs healthy controls .

23501053|Aggressive behavior is associated with dysfunctions in an affective regulation network encompassing amygdala and prefrontal areas such as orbitofrontal -LRB- OFC -RRB- , anterior cingulate -LRB- ACC -RRB- , and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- .

23490071|Denial or receipt of expected reward through maternal contact during the neonatal period differentially affect the development of the rat amygdala and program its function in adulthood in a sex-dimorphic way . .

23482625|Neuropeptide Y -LRB- NPY -RRB- has been associated with stress reactivity in affective disorders and is most densely expressed in the amygdala .

23482625|Thus , the combined effect of carrying NPY risk genotype and a history of CEM affected amygdala and PCC reactivity , areas related to emotion , self-relevance processing and autobiographical memory .

23479459|Results showed that , similarly to IAPS pictures , brands activated a well-defined emotional network , including amygdala and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , highly specific of affective valence .

23463152|We examined whether microinjections of orexin-A into the VP hotspot enhance the hedonic impact of sucrose , as assessed via affective taste reactivity measures of ` liking ' reactions , and additionally compared effects at nearby sites in adjacent LH and extended amygdala .

23437284|These results indicate that CACNA1C SNP rs1006737 affects amygdala activity during emotional processing across all diagnostic groups .

23433857|GMV reductions in bilateral fusiform gyrus and amygdala were observed in concordant affected twins for anxiety and depression compared to healthy twins .

23433857|As concordant affected MZ twins are believed to have a particularly high genetic liability for the disorder , our findings suggest that fusiform gyrus and amygdala gray matter reductions are related to a genetic risk for anxiety and depression .

23431488|Positron Emission Tomography-Computer Tomography -LRB- PET-CT -RRB- scan identified frontal , temporal , parietal , occipital , left cerebellar lobes , amygdala , hippocampus , and parahippocampus as the affected areas .

23430365|Animals with lesions in the hippocampus and amygdala had behavioral impairments indicating the importance of the integrity of these brain structures in learning and memory tasks which are disability characteristics of patients affected by PKU .

23426521|Finally , social isolation affects cell apoptosis in different brain areas , such as the medial prefrontal cortex , amygdala , nucleus accumbens , and hippocampus .

23404372|Post-mortem brain examination of the proband revealed atrophy affecting frontal and temporal lobes in addition to the caudate , putamen , globus pallidus and amygdala .

23380674|Relaxin-3 is also postulated to modulate affective behaviour , based on high densities of the relaxin-3 G-protein coupled receptor -LRB- RXFP3 -RRB- in brain areas involved in stress and mood/anxiety , including the central amygdala , bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus -LRB- PVN -RRB- ; and strong activation of relaxin-3 neurons by stressors , via activation of corticotropin-releasing factor receptor-1 -LRB- CRF1 -RRB- .

23373763|Aesthetic judgments engaged medial and lateral subdivisions of the orbitofrontal cortex as well as subcortical stations associated with affective motor planning -LRB- globus pallidus , putamen-claustrum , amygdala , and cerebellar vermis -RRB- , whereas the motor , premotor and supplementary motor areas , as well as the anterior insula and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , were engaged by both kinds of judgment .

23370055|A recent fMRI-study revealed neural responses for affective processing of stimuli for which overt attention irrespective of stimulus valence was required in the orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- and bilateral amygdala -LRB- AMY -RRB- : activation decreased with increasing cognitive demand .

23357445|Using voxel-based morphometry and magnetic resonance imaging , associations of BDNF and clinical anxiety with regional GMVs of anterior cingulate cortex , insula , amygdala , and hippocampus were examined in 39 affected -LRB- 17 Met allele carriers , 22 Val/Val homozygotes -RRB- and 63 nonaffected adolescents -LRB- 27 -LSB- corrected -RSB- Met allele carriers , 36 -LSB- corrected -RSB- Val/Val homozygotes -RRB- .

23349824|Using this method we show activation of the amygdala and related fear circuitry in response to a fear-conditioned stimulus and demonstrate that the magnitude of fear circuitry activation is increased following early life stress , a rodent model of affective disorders .

23345231|In this study of the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , which is critical in emotional learning of drug reward , we investigated how adaptive changes in the expression of GluA1 subunits affected the learning process of opioid-induced context-reward association -LRB- associative learning -RRB- for the acquisition of reward-related behavior .

23337772|Doses of GLP-1 and glucagon that individually did not significantly affect feeding , in combination were anorectic and stimulated neuronal activation in the area postrema -LRB- AP -RRB- and central nucleus of the amygdala .

25408902|The amygdala is a structure of the temporal lobe thought to be involved in assigning emotional significance to environmental information and triggering adapted physiological , behavioral and affective responses .

25408902|Pain having a strong affective and emotional dimension , the amygdala , especially its central nucleus -LRB- CeA -RRB- , has also emerged in the last twenty years as key element of the pain matrix .

23267100|Among these regions , the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- and basolateral amygdala , convey executive control and affective states , respectively .

23262120|Collectively , these results demonstrate that repeated stress differentially affects amygdalar glutamate systems and further supports our previous studies indicating that tianeptine 's antidepressant efficacy may involve targeting amygdalar glutatamatergic systems .

23238724|Individual differences in amygdala-medial prefrontal anatomy link negative affect , impaired social functioning , and polygenic depression risk . .

23238724|Individual differences in affective and social processes may arise from variability in amygdala-medial prefrontal -LRB- mPFC -RRB- circuitry and related genetic heterogeneity .

23238724|Analyses revealed that heightened negative affect was associated with increased amygdala volume and reduced thickness in a left mPFC region encompassing the subgenual and rostral anterior cingulate cortex .

23238724|The most extreme individuals displayed an inverse correlation between amygdala volume and mPFC thickness , suggesting that imbalance between these structures is linked to negative affect in the general population .

23238724|These collective findings suggest that , within the healthy population , there is significant variability in amygdala-mPFC circuitry that is associated with poor functioning across affective and social domains .

23228730|Kindling of the right basolateral amygdala profoundly affected spontaneous firing behavior and repetitive discharge characteristics of pyramidal neuronal electrophysiological properties .

23183827|We show that in PD brain tissue , the levels of LRRK2 are positively related to the increase in ?-synuclein phosphorylation and aggregation in affected brain regions -LRB- amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex -RRB- , but not in the unaffected visual cortex .

23160815|We find that initial reactivity in the amygdala does not predict trait measures of affective style .

23159012|These results indicate that neonatal amygdala damage alters basal HPA function in infant rhesus monkeys , affecting males only at early ages -LRB- at 2.5 months -RRB- , while leaving the postnatal T surge intact , and resulting in a flattened diurnal rhythm in both genders at the later ages .

23155479|Connectivity analyses reveal widespread improvisation-related correlations between medial prefrontal , cingulate motor , perisylvian cortices and amygdala , suggesting the emergence of a network linking motivation , language , affect and movement .

23147386|We show that single nucleotide polymorphisms -LRB- SNPs -RRB- affecting exon 6 of CRHR1 influence both AT and metabolic activity in the anterior hippocampus and amygdala , components of the neural circuit underlying AT .

23146356|We found that the ability to report on affective states involves -LRB- at least -RRB- three separable systems , one for directing attention to the affective response and making attributions about it that involves the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex , one for categorizing the response into a verbal label or word that involves the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex , and one sensitive to the intensity of the affective response including the ventral anterior insula and amygdala .

23142408|These results have implications for neural systems known to underlie affective processes , including the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala .

23103411|Novel odors affect gene expression for cytokines and proteinases in the rat amygdala and hippocampus . .

23097300|As pain is a multidimensional experience that encompasses physical sensation , affect , and cognition , the amygdala is well suited to play a part in this process .

23055486|It remains unknown , however , whether and how PACAP affects neuronal and synaptic functions in the amygdala .

23049496|It has been proposed that the medial pain system , including the amygdala , periaqueductal gray -LRB- PAG -RRB- , and anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , contains the neural circuitry that signals pain affect and negative value .

23035965|Reduced functional connectivity of prefrontal regions and amygdala within affect and working memory networks in pediatric bipolar disorder . .

23035965|Within a network for '' affect evaluation and regulation , '' PBD showed decreased functional connectivity relative to HC in regions involved in emotion processing such as the right amygdala , and in emotion regulation regions such as the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- VLPFC -RRB- , while functional connectivity was increased in emotion evaluation regions such as the bilateral medial PFC. Furthermore , in an '' Affective Working Memory Network , '' PBD exhibited greater connectivity relative to HC in left dorsolateral PFC -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- , caudate , and right VLPFC ; and simultaneously reduced connectivity in emotion processing regions , such as the right amygdala , bilateral temporal regions , and the junction of DLPFC/VLPFC , which interfaces affective and cognitive processes .

22999654|Yet , no study to date has investigated specifically how testosterone affects the amygdala response to fearful emotional expressions .

22989917|The amygdala has a fundamental role in driving affective behaviors in response to sensory cues .

22979952|Our results suggest that increased threat-related amygdala reactivity may represent a mechanism linking psychopathology to interactions between common genetic variants affecting HPA axis function and childhood trauma .

22973250|We investigated how structural variation of regions involved in socioemotional memory -LSB- ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- , amygdala -RSB- , as opposed to a region implicated in explicit memory -LRB- hippocampus -RRB- , affected memory for impressions in young and older adults .

22964986|The stronger interplay between systems dedicated to endogenous analgesia -LRB- periaqueductal gray -RRB- , affective processing -LRB- anterior cingulate cortex , amygdala -RRB- , memory -LRB- hippocampus -RRB- , and self-projective thinking -LRB- DMN -RRB- following this therapy supports the notion that acupuncture is a mind-body therapy which helps to reintegrate important neural dimensions of inner life and to establish psychophysical pain homeostasis .

22960774|In these patients , extrahypothalamic brain areas , like the hippocampus and basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , have been found to be affected .

22957066|Gene-by-environment interactions in amygdala and vmPFC activation may reflect a neural endophenotype translating genetic and adverse environmental influences into vulnerability for or resilience against developing affective psychopathology .

22956794|Neuroscience research indicates that moral reasoning is underpinned by distinct neural networks including the posterior superior temporal sulcus -LRB- pSTS -RRB- , amygdala , and ventromedial prefrontal cortex , which support communication between computational systems underlying affective states , cognitions , and motivational processes .

22952879|Finally , SP600125 affected noradrenergic activity in the central amygdala and locus coruleus under resting condition , but prevented the noradrenergic effects within the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus that were induced by the acute stressor exposure .

22938859|Neuropeptide Y -LRB- NPY -RRB- is abundant in the extended amygdala , a conceptual macrostructure in the basal forebrain important for regulation of negative affective states .

22927925|Since the jcBNST integrates excitatory inputs from the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and cortical inputs from the infralimbic and the insular cortices and in turn is believed to contribute to the inhibitory input to the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- the reduced excitability of the jcBNST during protracted withdrawal in alcohol-dependent animals will likely affect ability of the jcBNST to shape the activity and output of the CeA .

22922544|In addition , ageing impairs neurocognitive processes that are profoundly affected by oxytocin -LRB- including some aspects of memory and emotion recognition -RRB- and is associated with alterations in both structure and function of the amygdala , which is prominently involved in mediating effects of oxytocin .

22890117|A decrease in connectivity was observed in the auditory and somatosensory network in relation to regions responsible for pain sensing and the affective processing of pain , which included the amygdala , insula , and anterior cingulate cortex .

22876225|We propose a conceptual model of systems interaction wherein a ventral emotional memory network involving ventral striatum -LRB- VS -RRB- , amygdala , ventral hippocampus , and ventromedial prefrontal cortex triages behavioral responding to stimuli according to their associated affective outcomes .

22870240|At the neurophysiological level , this was manifested in a stronger activation of the amygdala and greater activity of the medial frontal gyrus , the left temporal pole and the middle temporal gyrus during affective eye gazes .

22840629|The findings indicate that amygdala dysfunction underlies affective deficits of psychopathy .

22840629|We propose that the insensitivity of the amygdala to the affective significance of social stimuli contributes to an increased risk of violation of social norms , but enhances the ability to attenuate impulses toward maladaptive aggression in successful psychopaths .

22837740|The first candidate is the amygdala , where activity is generally modulated by both affectively positive and negative signals from faces .

22828748|As tianeptine modulates cellular metrics that , in addition to mediating amygdalar behavioral output , are also affected by stress , we tested if tianeptine succeeds in countering stress effects in the intact animal .

22776418|As the central amygdala is known to be involved in the acquisition and expression of emotion , this pathway is thought to play central roles in the generation of affective responses to nociceptive inputs .

22766237|In this study , we investigated whether two brain regions , the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- and the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , affected male rats ' -LRB- Rattus norvigicus -RRB- ability to innately discriminate between a predator odor -LRB- cat urine -RRB- and female rat urine .

22754515|A combination of electrophysiological recording of vagal afferent fibers and in vivo microdialysis was employed in a second study to simultaneously assess how elevations in peripheral levels of epinephrine affect vagal nerve discharge and the subsequent potentiation of norepinephrine release in the basolateral amygdala .

22613629|We found that : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the perceptive component is mainly related to alterations of the precuneus and the inferior parietal lobe ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the affective component is mainly related to alterations of the prefrontal cortex , the insula and the amygdala ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- the cognitive component has been weakly explored .

22590453|Interestingly , brain activity in stress-associated brain regions such as the amygdala and habenula was not affected .

22529357|Moreover , higher maternal cortisol levels in early gestation was associated with more affective problems in girls , and this association was mediated , in part , by amygdala volume .

22529357|The current findings represent , to the best of our knowledge , the first report linking maternal stress hormone levels in human pregnancy with subsequent child amygdala volume and affect .

22507228|However , testosterone also affects connectivity between the orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- and the amygdala , which could subsequently lead to increased vigilance by reduced top-down control over the amygdala .

22507228|Finally , connectivity between the amygdala and the brain stem was not affected by testosterone administration .

22474105|Novel treatments could be aimed at strengthening the balance between cognitive control -LRB- dorsolateral PFC -RRB- and affective processing -LRB- medial PFC and amygdala -RRB- networks to improve overall functioning for PTSD patients .

22468617|In the study reported here , functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- was used to measure activity in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex of 10 participants who completed two independent tasks of emotion regulation-reappraisal , measuring intentional emotion regulation , and affect labeling , measuring incidental emotion regulation-with the objective of identifying potential overlap in the neural substrates underlying each task .

22468617|During reappraisal , this decrease in amygdala activation was accompanied by a proportional decrease in emotional intensity ratings ; during affect labeling , the decrease in amygdala activation correlated with self-reported aggression .

22468617|Importantly , across participants , the magnitude of decrease in amygdala activation during reappraisal correlated with the magnitude of decrease during affect labeling , even though the tasks were administered on separate days , and values indexing amygdala activation during each task were extracted independently of one another .

22389047|Higher MOR availability in the amygdala was associated with motivation to smoke to relieve negative affect .

22389047|Increased MOR availability in amygdala may underlie the motivation to smoke for negative affective relief .

22174802|As extraversion is regarded a protective factor for developing anxiety disorders and depression and has been related to the generation of positive affect , the present results indicate that the reduced likelihood of developing affective disorders in individuals high on extraversion is related to modulation of emotion processing through the orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala .

22141465|Endogenous cannabinoids such as anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol -LRB- 2-AG -RRB- exert important regulatory influences on neuronal signaling , participate in short - and long-term forms of neuroplasticity , and modulate stress responses and affective behavior in part through the modulation of neurotransmission in the amygdala .

21988521|Neonatal amygdala lesions result in globally blunted affect in adult rhesus macaques . .

21988521|The amygdala has been implicated in affective and social processing for more than a century .

21988521|Animals with damage to the amygdala have altered affective and social behavior patterns , though the precise nature of these behavioral changes depends on a number of factors including lesion technique , age of the subject at the time of lesion , rearing , and housing environments .

21988521|Interpretations of amygdala lesion studies are further complicated by the potentially confounded nature of affective and social stimuli -LRB- e.g. , social interactions with a conspecific partner that is consistently aggressive -RRB- .

21988521|In the present study , we evaluated affective responding to affectively and socially evocative video stimuli in a group of rhesus macaques that received bilateral amygdala lesions as neonates .

21961777|Our finding of an attenuated relationship between the amygdala , a region affected in MDD and involved in emotion processing , and cognitive control regions is consistent with a hypothesis of altered regulation of emotional processing in C-MDD , suggesting developmental continuity of this alteration into early childhood .

21945836|C-fos expression showed that the circuits involved in the retrieval of withdrawal memories are partly different when comparing recent and remote reactivation , showing that , like other type of memories , affective memories linked to opiate withdrawal undergo anatomical reorganization , with a shift from extended amygdala regions toward cortical areas .

21943083|Maternal affect and quality of parenting experiences are related to amygdala response to infant faces . .

21935637|Additional neurons were involved in the temporal neocortex in stage 3 , whereas the affection of the amygdala and/or the hypothalamus marked stage 4 .

21935483|Negative and positive emotionality differentially affected the hemodynamic responses to encoding and retrieval in the amygdala , with increased responses during encoding negative word and face pairs .

21924361|Given the central role of the amygdala in fear perception and expression and its likely abnormality in affective disorders and autism , there is great demand for a technique to measure differences in neurochemistry of the human amygdala .

21920442|Individuals with high anxiety show heightened neural activation in affective processing regions , including the amygdala and insula .

21920442|Using a robust multiple regression approach , we examined the effects of social anxiety , anxiety sensitivity , and trait anxiety -LRB- which overlapped with depressive symptoms , and can therefore be considered a measure of negative affectivity -RRB- on activation in insula , amygdala , and medial prefrontal cortex , in response to emotional faces .

21920442|Adjusting for negative affectivity and anxiety sensitivity , social anxiety was associated with activity in left amygdala , right insula , and subgenual anterior cingulate across all emotional faces .

21920442|When comparing negative and positive faces directly , greater negative affectivity was uniquely associated with less activity to positive faces in left amygdala , left anterior insula , and dorsal anterior cingulate .

21912391|We focused on the lateral/basolateral/basomedian complex of the amygdala as a neural hub of mood regulation affected in MDD .

21895344|During the mood induction , high-risk girls exhibited greater activation than did low-risk daughters in brain areas that have frequently been implicated in the experience of negative affect , including the amygdala and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex .

21889991|It is also conceivable that the actors ' training requires a more professional and controlled dealing with the emotional stimuli , resulting in a down-regulation of affective experience and accompanying amygdala responses .

21875617|Method of euthanasia affects amygdala plasticity in horizontal brain slices from mice . .

21861684|This network includes early visual regions , such as the inferior occipital gyrus , which is identified as insensitive to motion or affect but sensitive to the visual stimulus , the STS , identified as specifically sensitive to motion , and the amygdala , recruited to process affect .

21856318|Recent findings from our group point to substantial abnormalities affecting CSPGs , a main ECM component , in the amygdala and entorhinal cortex of subjects with schizophrenia , but not bipolar disorder .

21854858|Hyperactivity in the amygdala and hypoactivity in the vlPFC have been reported in manic bipolar patients scanned during the performance of an affective faces task .

21849983|Here , we show that stress-induced development of anxiety-like behavior is paralleled by a transient appearance of low-frequency stimulation-induced , 2-AG-mediated long-term depression at GABAergic synapses in the basolateral amygdala , a key region involved in motivation , affective regulation , and emotional learning .

21848809|Paternal deprivation affects the development of corticotrophin-releasing factor-expressing neurones in prefrontal cortex , amygdala and hippocampus of the biparental Octodon degus . .

21848809|The central amygdala , characterised by dense clusters of CRF-immunopositive neuropil , and the precentral medial , anterior cingulate , infralimbic and prelimbic cortices , were not affected by paternal deprivation .

21819983|Chronic stress did not affect dendritic spine density , but reduced dendritic arborization in interneurons of the lateral and basolateral amygdala .

21803062|The cognitive ToM network primarily engages the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex , the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsal striatum ; and the affective ToM network primarily engages the ventromedial and orbitofrontal cortices , the ventral anterior cingulate cortex , the amygdala and the ventral striatum ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- self and other mental-state representation is processed by distinct brain regions within the mentalizing network , and that the ability to distinguish between self and other mental states is modulated by a functionally interactive dorsal and ventral attention/selection systems at the temporoparietal junction and the anterior cingulate cortex ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- ToM functioning is dependent on the integrity of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems which are primarily engaged in the maintenance and application processes of represented mental states .

21777430|To advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in sarin-induced toxicity , we analyzed gene expression changes in four other areas of the rat brain known to be affected by nerve agent-induced seizure -LRB- amygdala , hippocampus , septum , and thalamus -RRB- .

21771612|Highlighting some current trends in the field , we further argue that stress affects learning and memory processes beyond the basolateral amygdala and hippocampus and that stress may pre-program subsequent memory performance when it is experienced during critical periods of brain development .

21742442|Glutamate release in prefrontal cortex is increased by subanaesthetic doses of ketamine , resulting in increased inhibition , possibly via intercalated GABAerg cells , of projections from amygdala , affecting structures critically involved in depersonalization .

21726490|Impaired top-down regulation of the amygdala , and its modulation by serotonin -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- , is strongly implicated in the dysregulation of negative emotion that characterizes a number of affective disorders .

21699892|A number of clinical and animal studies have indicated that the limbic system including the anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- and amygdala plays a critical role in the processing of affective components of pain .

21697947|Current city living was associated with increased amygdala activity , whereas urban upbringing affected the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex , a key region for regulation of amygdala activity , negative affect and stress .

21677650|Although the amygdala has been implicated in both social and OT-mediated actions , bilateral OTR-A -LRB- 0.1 ?g / 1 ?l -RRB- or OT -LRB- 0.01 ?g / 1 ?l -RRB- administration into various subnuclei of the amygdala did not affect basal or stress-induced social preference behavior , respectively .

21669291|This down-regulation of negative affect was further accompanied by a concordant reduction of activation in the left amygdala .

21642353|Specifically , activity in brain areas during Task 1 associated with -LRB- i -RRB- executive control and response suppression -LRB- i.e. lateral prefrontal cortex -RRB- and -LRB- ii -RRB- affective responses and value representation -LRB- i.e. orbitofrontal cortex -RRB- , systematically covaried with behavioral ratings and amygdala activity obtained during Task 2 .

21634022|Interestingly , present data indicate that glutamate in the male MePD induces only a subtle modification in the feeding behavior and suggest that large electrolytic lesions of the '' posterodorsal '' amygdaloid region might have affected other regions to alter drastically meal size consumption in rats .

21620907|Additional connectivity analyses revealed that a negative coupling between lateral PFC on the one hand and amygdala and OFC on the other is related to enhanced interference resolution which can be tentatively interpreted as evidence that emotional regulation is an integrated part of an agent 's efforts to preserve cognitive performance in affective situations .

21600684|These results indicate that activity in the amygdala and ventral striatum may be inversely related , and that both regions may provide opposing affective bias signals during emotion identification .

21571252|Binge cocaine administration in adolescent rats affects amygdalar gene expression patterns and alters anxiety-related behavior in adulthood . .

21568639|Past studies revealed that the frontopolar OFC allows for updating the affective values of stimuli in reversal learning or extinction of conditioning -LSB- e.g. , Izquierdo , A. , & Murray , E. A. Opposing effects of amygdala and orbital PFC lesions on the extinction of instrumental responding in macaque monkeys .

21558425|MiRNA expression profiling revealed decreased expression of miR-34b and miR-34c in brain areas with variable neuropathological affectation at clinical -LRB- motor -RRB- stages -LRB- Braak stages 4 and 5 -RRB- of the disease , including the amygdala , frontal cortex , substantia nigra and cerebellum .

21534661|Although multiple neuroimaging studies suggest that affect labeling -LRB- i.e. , putting feelings into words -RRB- can dampen affect-related responses in the amygdala , the consequences of affect labeling have not been examined in other channels of emotional responding .

21523442|Training of ?-suppression using neurofeedback and reanimation of the fusiform gyrus and amygdala using computer-aided facial affect recognition training are introduced as neurobiologically based ASD interventions .

21487661|The current study investigates the role of three brain regions each implicated in the modulation of negative affective states-the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- , the central -LRB- CeA -RRB- , and the basolateral -LRB- BLA -RRB- nucleus of the amygdala .

21470595|Oxytocin might modulate the activation of brain structures involved in the perception of cry sounds-specifically the insula , the amygdala , and the thalamocingulate circuit-and thereby affect responsiveness to infant crying .

21447623|We examined whether the cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 -LRB- WIN ; 5 µg / side -RRB- microinjected into the hippocampus or the amygdala would differentially affect memory processes in a neutral vs. an aversive task .

21443894|In contrast , hypoxia caused robust Fos activation in the basolateral and central amygdala , which was not affected by prelimbic BMI injection .

21438079|Hippocampal but not amygdalar volume affects contextual fear conditioning in humans . .

21437203|These data suggest that the multifaceted effects of NPS on amygdaloid circuitry may shape behavior-related network activity patterns in the amygdala and reflect the peptide 's potent activity in various forms of affective behavior and emotional memory .

21433410|In line with this idea , amygdala activation -LRB- by electrical stimulation or exposure to an emotional event -RRB- has been demonstrated to affect synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus .

21425102|Some of the more significant structural changes are those affecting the hippocampus , the amygdala , the cerebellar structures , the corpus callosum and the cerebral cortex .

21415225|Numerous studies have examined amygdala activation in response to affective stimuli in SCZ , but no consensus has emerged .

21411044|In this study , repeated daily injection of TCAP-1 for 10 days increased spine density in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus without affecting spine density in the amygdala .

21382560|Responses to affective facial displays exhibited a combination of general and emotion-specific changes in ventral striatum -LRB- VS -RRB- , ventromedial PFC , amygdala , and temporal pole .

21339500|Histologic studies show that the amygdala is affected by Alzheimer disease -LRB- AD -RRB- pathology , and its medial aspect is the most involved .

21318348|The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the blockade of muscarinic receptors -LRB- mRs -RRB- in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , which receives important cholinergic inputs related to avoidance learning , affects the consolidation of two-way active avoidance -LRB- TWAA -RRB- .

21315824|Additionally , our data corroborate the hypothesis that basolateral amygdala is not the specific site of storage of aversive memories , since retention of the previously learned task was not affected by pre-testing inactivation .

21315749|A negative correlation was observed between negative affectivity and activation of the amygdala , fusiform gyrus , insula and hippocampus .

21315265|These two dimensions may contribute to symptomatology differences across anxiety disorders ; the amygdala mechanism affecting the development of phobic fear and the frontal mechanism influencing the maintenance of both specific fears and generalized anxiety .

21307256|Lesions of the basolateral amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex differentially affect acquisition and performance of a rodent gambling task . .

21307256|However , whether damage to the OFC or amygdala impairs subjects ' ability to learn the task , or actually affects the decision-making process itself , is currently unclear .

21284912|In schizophrenia , the severity of flat affect correlated significantly with neural activity in several brain areas including the amygdala and parahippocampal region bilaterally .

21284912|These results suggest that many of the brain regions involved in emotional face perception , including the amygdala , are equally recruited in both schizophrenia and controls , but flat affect can also moderate activity in some other brain regions , notably in the left amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus bilaterally .

21272015|Hippocampus , amygdala , and stress : interacting systems that affect susceptibility to addiction . .

21257158|Studies of depressed patients have demonstrated increased amygdala activation to negative affective stimuli .

21255131|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- has a fundamental role in affective processing .

21242990|In contrast , its influence on amygdala coupling with the insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex was dependent on perceived threat , rather than actual exposure , suggesting that threat appraisal affects interoceptive awareness and amygdala regulation .

21232571|These data suggest that cognitive manipulations affect the response to food cues in the prefrontal cortex , in areas involved in the planning and control of motivated behaviors , while the amygdala and insula responded equally in both conditions , consistent with a more basic role in homeostatically driven appetitive behavior .

21211108|In particular , the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- provides an affective input that overlaps with context-related information derived from the ventral subiculum of the hippocampus -LRB- vSub -RRB- .

21209220|GABAergic neurons in the external capsule -LRB- EC -RRB- provide feedforward inhibition in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- , but how EC affects synaptic transmission and plasticity in inputs from specific cortical areas remains unknown ; this is because axonal fibers from different cortical areas are intermingled in the amygdala and can not be activated selectively using conventional electrical stimulation .

21203551|The question whether amygdala activation is primarily abnormal and affects other brain systems or whether it responds '' normally '' to an abnormal pattern of information conveyed by other brain structures remained unanswered .

21195195|Neuroimaging studies have consistently linked depression to hyperactivation of a -LRB- para -RRB- limbic affective processing network centered around the amygdala .

21195195|Recent studies have started to investigate how antidepressant drugs affect amygdala reactivity in healthy individuals , but the influence of their subchronic administration on the functional integrity of the affective neurocircuitry as a whole remains unknown .

21195195|Using an emotional face matching task we demonstrated that duloxetine reduced neural responses in affect processing regions including the amygdala , the anterior insula , the thalamus and the ventral aspect of the anterior cingulate cortex .

22832658|Focusing on 2 ' -3 ' - cyclic nucleotide 3 ' - phosphodiesterase -LRB- Cnp1 -RRB- , a crucial component of axoglial communication dysregulated in the amygdala of MDD subjects and UCMS-exposed mice , we show that altered oligodendrocyte integrity can have an unexpected functional role in affect regulation .

21179564|Our previous fMRI study demonstrated that amygdala reactivity was independently predicted by affective-cognitive styles -LRB- phobic prone or eating disorders prone -RRB- and genotype of the serotonin transporter in a discrimination task of fearful facial expressions .

21167789|IBS patients also exhibit greater activation of brain areas involved in pain affect such as the amygdala , yet the role of supraspinal processes in the effects of ovarian hormones on visceral pain is largely unexplored .

21167789|Furthermore , administration of progesterone or estradiol to areas adjacent to the amygdala did not affect visceral sensitivity .

21161192|The pulvinar connects the amygdala to cells in the SC responsible for the speed of saccade execution , while not affecting the spatial component of the saccade .

21160563|The eccentricity of the emotional stimuli did not affect responses in the amygdala and no interaction effect between attentional load and spatial location was found .

21148459|Results support the view that the insular cortex may play a broad role in integrating affective and cognitive processes , whereas the amygdala may have a more selective role in affective arousal , especially for negative stimuli .

21109253|Post-traumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- affects regions that support autobiographical memory -LRB- AM -RRB- retrieval , such as the hippocampus , amygdala and ventral medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- .

21108955|Interestingly , this impairment was observed in patients with incomplete resection of the amygdala that spared the central nucleus and the corticomedial complex , suggesting that a resection of the basolateral complex is sufficient to affect fear recognition .

21094938|Conduct disorder , by contrast , has consistently been associated with abnormalities of the '' hot '' paralimbic system that regulates motivation and affect , comprising lateral orbital and ventromedial prefrontal cortices , superior temporal lobes , and underlying limbic structures , most prominently the amygdala .

21059346|Furthermore , it has been proposed that the amygdala might be especially sensitive to affective stimuli in the periphery .

21059346|In contrast to previous findings , we found that the amygdala responds to LSF and HSF stimuli in a similar manner regardless of the location of the affective stimuli in the visual field .

21059346|Our findings argue against the view that LSF information plays a crucial role in the processing of facial expressions in the amygdala and of a higher sensitivity to affective stimuli in the periphery .

21052746|Since all subsequently affected nuclei -LRB- lower raphe nuclei , magnocellular reticular formation , locus coeruleus , and central subnucleus of the amygdala -RRB- generate descending projections that terminate in the vagal dorsal motor nucleus and intermediolateral column , it has been conjectured that retrograde axonal transport and transsynaptic transmission of a pathogen contribute to the pathogenesis of PD .

21041607|During affect matching , fMRI showed no differences between groups in amygdala activation but found lower activation in methamphetamine-dependent than control participants in the bilateral ventral inferior frontal gyrus .

21041607|During affect labeling , participants recruited the dorsal inferior frontal gyrus and exhibited decreased amygdala activity , consistent with successful emotion regulation ; there was no group difference in this effect .

21041607|The magnitude of decrease in amygdala activity during affect labeling correlated inversely with self-reported aggression in control participants and perpetrated aggression in all participants .

21030482|This finding suggests that the activity of the amygdala can affect the interaction between dmPFC activity and learning .

20959860|A subcortical pathway through the superior colliculus and pulvinar to the amygdala is commonly assumed to mediate the non-conscious processing of affective visual stimuli .

20959860|Instead , we propose that the primary role of the amygdala in visual processing , like that of the pulvinar , is to coordinate the function of cortical networks during evaluation of the biological significance of affective visual stimuli .

20951774|Our previous work showed that 7 month old human apoE4 targeted replacement -LRB- TR -RRB- mice displayed significant synaptic deficits in the principal neurons of the lateral amygdala , a region that is critical for memory formation and also one of the primary regions affected in Alzheimer 's disease , compared to apoE3 TR mice .

20951774|In the current study , we determined how age and varying APOE genotype affect synaptic integrity of amygdala neurons by comparing electrophysiological and morphometric properties in C57BL6 , apoE knockout , and human apoE3 , E4 and E2/4 TR mice at 1 month and 7 months .

20951774|These findings demonstrate that expression of human apoE4 contributes to functional deficits in the amygdala very early in development and may be responsible for altering neuronal circuitry that eventually leads to cognitive and affective disorders later in life .

20941370|Abnormal functional connectivity was found within three resting-state networks in depression : -LRB- 1 -RRB- decreased bilateral amygdala and left anterior insula connectivity in an affective network , -LRB- 2 -RRB- reduced connectivity of the left frontal pole in a network associated with attention and working memory , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- decreased bilateral lingual gyrus connectivity within ventromedial visual regions .

20936300|All other structures were affected to some degree in the manifest group , although brainstem , thalamus and amygdala were relatively spared .

20933525|Damage or disturbances of amygdalar connectivity may therefore lead to disconnection syndromes , in which the synchronous processing of affective and cognitive aspects of memory is impaired .

20889144|A specialized projection from pOFC to the intercalated masses of the amygdala is poised to flexibly affect autonomic responses in emotional arousal or return to homeostasis .

20888864|The interacting effects of deprivation state and lesions of the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- on CS consumption and affective state were examined .

20888864|The amygdala-dependent negative affective shift observed in deprived rats may be due to an aversive Pavlovian conditioned response that acts to suppress drinking .

20888864|The amygdala-independent negative affective response and reduced consumption in nearly satiated rats could be due to a form of latent learning of a stimulus-outcome association .

20875856|In the subcortical regions , hyperthermic seizures enhanced Fos expression region -- specifically in the limbic and paralimbic regions -LRB- e.g. , hippocampus , amygdala , and perirhinal-entorhinal cortex -RRB- without affecting other brain regions -LRB- e.g. , basal ganglia , diencephalon , and lower brainstem -RRB- , suggesting a primary involvement of limbic system in the induction of hyperthermic seizures .

20869122|Findings indicated that depressed preschoolers exhibited a significant positive relationship between depression severity and right amygdala activity when viewing facial expressions of negative affect .

20865251|Three general conclusions emerge : -LRB- 1 -RRB- higher-order , complex cognitive and affective functions associated with brain regions undergoing protracted postnatal development are particularly vulnerable to the deleterious effects of ELS ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the amygdala is particularly sensitive to early ELS ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- several deficits , particularly those in the affective domain , appear to persist years after ELS has ceased and may increase risk for later psychopathology .

20851110|Repeated administration of Nor-1 shRNA ameliorated the depressive behavior of WKYs in the FST and decreased amygdalar Nor-1 mRNA levels without affecting GR mRNA levels .

20848609|Previous studies show that A? overproduction affects spine morphology in the hippocampus and amygdala , both within and outside plaques -LRB- Knafo et al. , -LRB- 2009 -RRB- Cereb Cortex 19:586 -592 ; Knafo et al. , -LRB- in press -RRB- J Pathol -RRB- .

20845228|To investigate the functional connectivity among amygdala , insula , and auditory cortex during affective auditory stimulation and its relevance for psychotherapy , the authors recorded , using functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- , the blood oxygenation level-dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- responses of these brain regions in 20 healthy adults while listening to affective sounds -LRB- laughing and crying -RRB- .

20845228|This suggested that affect regulation using cognitive control may have been achieved through active inhibition of amygdalar structures by the cortex .

20832055|Recent studies have suggested that oxytocin affects social cognition and behavior mediated by the oxytocin receptor -LRB- OXTR -RRB- in amygdala in humans as well as in experimental animals .

20736510|We investigated the roles of ? - and ? -LRB- 2 -RRB- - adrenoceptors within the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- in the negative affective and sensory components of visceral pain in rats .

20728556|3rdpp-judgements about affective states differed from visuospatial 3rdpp judgements by a significantly higher activation of the anterior mentalizing network -LRB- dorsomedial prefrontal cortex , anterior superior temporal sulcus , temporal poles -RRB- and the limbic system -LRB- left amygdala and hippocampus -RRB- .

20728556|The simultaneous activation of the cortical mentalizing network and the amygdala indicates that cognitive empathy actually involves reference to own affective states in the observer .

20716480|The amygdala is the central region devoted to the processing of emotional valence and its sub-nuclei including the baso-lateral and centro-medial are organized in a relative hierarchy of affective processing .

20685878|L-368 ,899 affected Fos immunoreactivity in the paraventricular hypothalamus , arcuate nucleus , amygdala , and nucleus of the solitary tract , areas involved in aversion , satiety , and reward .

20669025|The amygdala and entorhinal cortex were the most frequently affected sites of TDP-43 pathology in LBD-Ltau cases .

20667170|The Met allele of the catechol-O-methyltransferase -LRB- COMT -RRB- valine-to-methionine -LRB- Val158Met -RRB- polymorphism is known to affect dopamine-dependent affective regulation within amygdala-prefrontal cortical -LRB- PFC -RRB- networks .

20667170|We employed functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure activation in the amygdala , ventromedial PFC -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- and ventrolateral PFC -LRB- vlPFC -RRB- during sad facial affect processing in family members with BD -LRB- n = 40 -RRB- , MDD and anxiety disorders -LRB- n = 22 -RRB- or no psychiatric diagnosis -LRB- n = 25 -RRB- and 50 healthy controls .

20663957|Importantly , the long-lasting change in state of amygdala neurons greatly affects the responsiveness to subsequent surges of corticosterone , revealing a quick suppression of glutamatergic transmission , which requires the glucocorticoid receptor .

20647384|Activation and interregional coupling of the amygdala during the processing of emotionally salient social cues was significantly affected by genotype .

20638303|Unilateral pDA does not necessarily affect the amygdalar fMRI BOLD-response .

20600336|Whereas one left-sided HF-rTMS session did not affect amygdala processing of the positive or negative stimuli , after a single right-sided HF-rTMS session we found a significant right amygdala activity attenuation during the processing of negatively valenced baby faces .

20592193|In contrast , TRPV1 transcription in amygdala , prefrontal cortex , and thalamus was not affected by TMJ inflammation and estradiol .

26271495|These include : -LRB- 1 -RRB- a cortical-hippocampal circuit that mediates declarative memory , our capacity to recollect facts and events ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- procedural memory subsystems involving a cortical-striatal circuit that mediates habit formation and a brainstem-cerebellar circuit that mediates sensorimotor adaptations ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- a circuit involving subcortical and cortical pathways through the amygdala that mediates the attachment of affective status and emotional responses to previously neutral stimuli .

20571485|We discuss limited neuropsychological evidence suggesting that affective cognition depends critically on the amygdala , ventromedial frontal cortex , and the connections between them .

20570628|Both the amygdala and the hippocampus have been shown to suffer significant damage after nerve agent exposure , but the amygdala appears to be the more severely affected structure .

20550755|In this study we investigated whether individual differences in trait anxiety affect amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- dACC -RRB- activation during fear conditioning and extinction .

20534533|Unfortunately , little is known about how exactly FXS affects synaptic function in the amygdala .

20521849|Emerging evidence indicates that stimulus novelty is affectively potent and reliably engages the amygdala and other portions of the affective workspace in the brain .

20521849|Although there were no age-related differences in the peak response of the amygdala to novelty , older individuals showed a narrower , sharper -LRB- i.e. , '' peakier '' -RRB- hemodynamic time course in response to novel stimuli , as well as decreased connectivity between the left amygdala and the affective areas including orbito-frontal regions .

20514925|To date , it remains unclear whether amygdala damage only affects fear-conditioned startle responding or impairs both the latter and fear-conditioned skin conductance responding -LRB- SCR -RRB- .

20514925|Based on these findings we concluded that the fear conditioning impairment in amygdala-damaged patients was not restricted to SCRs , but also affected valence ratings and memory of the presented contingency .

20512649|The amygdala and hippocampal dentate gyrus were most frequently affected in PSP .

20510373|However , studies on COMT-genotype effects on activity of the amygdala , a brain region centrally involved in affective processing , have yielded inconsistent results .

20510373|Our results support previous reports of a COMT-genotype-dependent difference in amygdala responsivity as well as connectivity , and highlight the importance of naturally occurring genetic variations in the catecholaminergic system for neural activity underlying affective processing .

20506471|Transformations in affective and social behaviors , many of which involve amygdalar circuits , are hallmarks of adolescence in many mammalian species .

20505082|We find that amygdala-specific reduction of alpha1 receptor subunits does not affect mRNA or protein levels of amygdala alpha2 or alpha3 subunit receptors .

20488680|In the present study , we investigated the automatic responsivity of the amygdala to emotional faces in schizophrenia and its relationship to clinical symptomatology by applying an affective priming task .

20479759|Here , we show by voxel-based morphometry in 32 human subjects in a placebo-controlled study that weekly high-dose EPO for as little as 3 months halts the progressive atrophy in brain areas typically affected in schizophrenia , including hippocampus , amygdala , nucleus accumbens , and several neocortical areas .

20472137|Activation of ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- - type glutamate receptors in limbic system nuclei , such as the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , plays an essential role in autonomic , behavioral , and affective processes that are profoundly impacted by exposure to opioids .

20472137|These results indicate that postsynaptic NMDA receptor activity in central amygdala neurons is required for the expression of a learned affective behavior associated with opioid withdrawal .

20463404|Hippocampal and cortical mitochondria showed the highest levels of mitochondrial dysfunction , while striatal mitochondria were moderately affected , and amygdalar mitochondria were minimally affected .

20457221|MK801 is a prototypical non-competitive NMDA receptor-antagonist that induces behavioural changes and reversible toxicity at low doses , while at higher doses triggers neuronal death that mainly affects the retrosplenial cortex -LRB- RSC -RRB- and to a lesser extent other structures such as the posterolateral cortical amygdaloid nucleus -LRB- PLCo -RRB- .

18540880|Crucially , activity in the amygdala increased significantly when participants correctly detected the target expression , compared with trials in which the identical target was missed , suggesting that the amygdala has a limited capacity for extracting affective facial expressions .

18540778|To examine the neurophysiological effects of secretin on amygdalar activation in humans , the authors measured Blood Oxygen Level Dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging signal change during facial affect processing in a placebo-controlled double-blind study .

18539249|In this functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- study , the focus was on the amygdala activation and we investigated whether individual differences in activity of the amygdala following presentation of emotional expressions in the face and the whole body may be systematically related to the presence of Type D -LRB- distressed -RRB- personality or to its constituting factors , Negative Affectivity -LRB- NA -RRB- and Social Inhibition -LRB- SI -RRB- .

18434920|The main outcome measures were psychometric measures of temperament -LRB- four factors : effortful control , negative affectivity , surgency , and affiliativeness -RRB- based on the Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire-Revised , and volumetric measures of a priori brain regions of interest -LRB- anterior cingulate cortex -LSB- ACC -RSB- , orbitofrontal cortex , amygdala , and hippocampus -RRB- .

18423428|There are evidence suggesting that the function of adrenergic receptor is affected in the amygdala of animals with anxiety-like behavior .

18392107|The amygdala and the experience of affect . .

18392107|The current study examined the hypothesis that amygdala activation serves as a neural precondition for negative affective experience .

18392107|Negative affect , as measured during the experience-sampling procedure 1-year prior , was positively correlated with amygdala activation in response to these brief presentations of fear depictions .

18392107|The results are consistent with the interpretation that the amygdala contributes to negative affective experience by increasing perceptual sensitivity for negative stimuli .

18391224|This raises the possibility that stress-induced elevation in GC secretion might directly affect amygdaloid neurons .

18383904|Frequent extrahippocampal pathology affects the amygdala , first seen with neuronal cell loss and gliosis in the laterobasal complex .

18381633|Taken together , these data indicate that DYN - and CRF-labeled axon terminals , most likely arising from amygdalar sources , are positioned dually to affect LC function , whereas DYN and ENK function in parallel .

18371990|In addition , rimonabant also affected the dopamine deficits generated by alcohol abstinence in the amygdala and ventral-tegmental area , albeit to a lesser extent .

18359276|Within the CPS group , the children with an affective/anxiety disorder had significantly larger left amygdala volumes , as well as greater amygdala asymmetry , compared with those with no psychopathology .

18359276|In pediatric CPS , left amygdala involvement may reflect effects of the neuropathology underlying comorbid affective or anxiety disorders on amygdala development rather than effects of ongoing seizures .

18346997|An imbalance between prefrontal regulatory influences and hyper-responsivity of the amygdala and other limbic regions involved in affective evaluation are implicated .

18345988|Amygdala hyperactivation in response to fearful faces may explain increased vulnerability to affective disorders in adolescence ; stronger amygdala-hippocampus connectivity in adults than adolescents may reflect maturation in learning or habituation to facial expressions .

18341997|Moreover , since ratings of perceived pleasantness of FO + , FO - , and drink were similar , the response in the amygdala and thalamus can not reflect acquired affective value but rather predictive meaning or biological relevance .

18340460|Projections from the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- to the amygdala -LRB- AMG -RRB- regulate affective behaviors in a manner that is modulated by dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- .

18337009|Following verum , but not sham , acupuncture there was increased DMN connectivity with pain -LRB- anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , periaqueductal gray -RRB- , affective -LRB- amygdala , ACC -RRB- , and memory -LRB- hippocampal formation , middle temporal gyrus -RRB- related brain regions .

18335544|These results demonstrate that distinct neuronal phenotypes in the basolateral amygdala are activated by acute restraint stress and that prior repeated restraint stress differentially affects this response .

18322078|We found that THC significantly reduced amygdala reactivity to social signals of threat but did not affect activity in primary visual and motor cortex .

18308474|Based on these findings , we suggest that changes in the morphology of pyramidal neurons in the BLA by SPS could be mediated through the enhancement of NPY functions , and this structural plasticity in the amygdala provides a cellular and molecular basis to understand for affective disorders .

18299581|Prefrontal and amygdala volumes are related to adolescents ' affective behaviors during parent-adolescent interactions . .

18294820|In the negative affect condition , relative to the neutral condition , patients with bipolar disorder demonstrated greater activation of bilateral pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and left amygdala , and less activation in right rostral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- and dorsolateral PFC at the junction of the middle frontal and inferior frontal gyri .

18294820|In the positive affect condition , there was no reduced activation of PFC or increased amygdala activation .

18283492|The monoamines in the amygdala modulate multiple aspects of emotional processing in the mammalian brain , and organic or pharmacological dysregulation of these systems can result in affective pathologies .

18234159|Here we used the prenatally stressed -LRB- PS -RRB- rat to see if chronic GC activation affects this protective mechanism in the amygdala .

18221376|Consistent with this , the neurotransmitter substance P -LRB- SP -RRB- level in affective brain areas including amygdala , hypothalamus , and periaqueductal gray was significantly increased in CatE - / - mice compared with CatE + / + mice , indicating that the increased aggressive behavior of CatE - / - mice by isolation housing followed by territorial challenge is mainly because of the enhanced SP/NK -1 receptor signaling system .

18206186|Overall , our results suggest a competition model in which affective significance signals from the amygdala may constitute a key modulatory factor determining the neural fate of visual stimuli .

18199239|Preliminary findings also suggest that subcortical structures , particularly the striatum , amygdala , and hippocampus , may be differentially affected in MDD and BD .

18191960|By the same token , emotional processing in the amygdala might be affected by reward-related processing in the mesolimbic system .

18191960|Emotional processing in the amygdala , on the other hand , was not affected by reward .

18185497|A wealth of research identifies the amygdala as a key brain region mediating negative affect , and implicates amygdala dysfunction in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders .

18171711|A major site of extra-hypothalamic expression of CRF and its receptors is the amygdala , a key player in affect-related disorders such as anxiety .

18171711|The latero-capsular division of the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeLC -RRB- is also important for pain modulation and pain affect .

18166271|Microinfusions of N/OFQ -LRB- 10 or 32pmol -RRB- into the central amygdala -LRB- ACE -RRB- increased the time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus-maze -LRB- anxiolytic-like effects -RRB- , whereas microinfusions of N/OFQ -LRB- 10 , 32 or 100 pmol -RRB- into the basolateral amygdala -LRB- ABL -RRB- did not affect the time spent in the open arms .

19639038|These findings were supported by neuroimaging studies that identify increased brain activity during traumatic cognition , especially in affective networks -LRB- including the amygdala , orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex -RRB- .

18158315|Compared to controls , patients showed increased antisaccade error rates and decreased error-related activation in the reinforcement learning network -- dorsal ACC , striatum and brainstem -LRB- possibly substantia nigra -RRB- -- and also in the affective appraisal network -- rostral ACC , insula and amygdala .

18088282|Behaviourally , the bilateral microinjection of CCK-4 -LRB- 0.043-4 .3 pmol/side -RRB- or CCK-8S -LRB- 4.3 pmol/side -RRB- into the rostrolateral amygdala reduced the open-arm exploration in the elevated plus-maze without affecting locomotion .

18081184|However , seizure activity produced or exacerbated by amygdalar BBB disruption can significantly increase CPu somatic neurodegeneration -LRB- but not affect dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- terminal damage -RRB- .

18080129|In both BIBD and NIFID , the frontotemporal cortex including the precentral gyrus , caudate nucleus , putamen , globus pallidus , thalamus , amygdala , hippocampus including the dentate gyrus , substantia nigra , and pyramidal tract were severely affected , whereas lower motor neuron degeneration was minimal .

18077660|We here examined how corticosterone affects these properties in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

18077069|Acute stress differentially affects corticotropin-releasing hormone mRNA expression in the central amygdala of the .

18076995|Although amygdala activity has been purported to be modulated by affective and non-affective factors , considerable controversy remains on its precise functional nature .

18076995|The level of attentional processing affected amygdala activity , as passive processing was associated with a higher probability of activation than active task instructions .

18071142|Here we investigate whether the amygdala , a temporal lobe structure , is affected by ALS .

18060697|These findings indicate that increases in CRF may be involved in the negative affect state associated with nicotine withdrawal and that acupuncture may attenuate anxiety-like behavior following nicotine withdrawal by modulating CRF in the amygdala .

18056543|Furthermore , greater amygdala activation to the presentation of fearful faces was highly correlated with greater severity of flat affect .

18056543|Abnormal amygdala activation in schizophrenia in response to presentation of fearful faces is paradoxically associated with failure to recognize the emotion and with more severe flat affect .

18040817|IL-1 signaling is required for the production of amygdala PGE -LRB- 2 -RRB- in response to surgical stress , and may thus affect the physiological and psychological aspects of surgical stress .

18039673|Serotonin plays a role in the regulation of emotional states in amygdala which in turn affect the function of hypothalamus .

18039043|Individuals who showed greater activity in regions associated with affective and pain processing -LRB- dorsal anterior cingulate cortex , amygdala , periaqueductal gray -RRB- during scanner-based social rejection reported feeling greater momentary social distress during their daily social interactions .

18037003|These hormones affect brain function at those sites where receptors are enriched , like the hippocampus , lateral septum , amygdala nuclei , and prefrontal cortex .

18036156|Ethanol discontinuation significantly decreased NPY immunoreactivity and concomitantly increased Y1R/LacZ transgene expression in the amygdala , whereas chronic ethanol intake failed to affect these parameters .

18030306|In contrast , in brain regions known to process the affective dimension of pain -LRB- parahippocampal gyrus , amygdala , anterior insula -RRB- , pain-related activation disappeared at the lowest alfentanil dose , without genotype differences .

18021374|The amygdala , especially the basolateral nuclear group , was severely affected by neuronal loss with tissue rarefaction .

17995911|This effect , however , was not fear specific because other affective materials evoked comparable signal strength in the amygdala .

17987064|The amygdala plays a central role in various aspects of affect processing and mood regulation by its rich anatomical connections to other limbic and cortical regions .

17987064|It is plausible that depressive disorders , and response to antidepressant drugs , may reflect changes in the physiological coupling between the amygdala and other components of affect-related large-scale brain systems .

17987064|We explored this hypothesis by mapping the functional coupling of right and left amygdalae in functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired from 19 patients with major depressive disorder and 19 healthy volunteers , each scanned twice -LRB- at baseline and 8 weeks later -RRB- during performance of an implicit facial affect processing task .

17962049|They showed that neurons in the lateral amygdala compete to take part in auditory fear conditioned memory traces and that the levels of the transcription factor CREB -LRB- cAMP-response element binding protein -RRB- can affect the probability of a neuron to be recruited into a given memory representation .

17960646|With the present study , we used induction of the immediate early gene Fos , to test the hypothesis that the amygdala may affect neuronal activation of the hippocampus in response to different spatial environments -LRB- familiar , modified , and novel -RRB- .

17960646|These findings support the idea that the amygdala modulates spatial information processing in the hippocampus and may affect encoding of specific environmental features , while complex behavioral responses to environment may be the result of broader neural circuits .

17942736|In the present study , we investigated whether allopregnanolone modulates memory for biologically salient stimuli by influencing amygdala activity , which in turn may affect neural processes in other brain regions .

17942736|Given the important role of the amygdala in the modulation of memory , these results suggest that allopregnanolone alters memory by influencing amygdala activity , which in turn may affect memory processes in other brain regions .

17919468|mu opioid receptors were less significantly affected but clear tendency to decrease binding occurred in adult rats in various cortical , amygdala and thalamic regions early after SE .

17915324|These results suggest dysfunction among antisocial individuals in specified neural substrates , namely the amygdala , involved in processing fearful facial affect .

17910580|Protection limited to CA1 and/or CA3 -LRB- caffeine , topiramate , vigabatrin , amygdala kindling -RRB- did not affect the latency to spontaneous seizures .

17885723|Borderline personality disorder -LRB- BPD -RRB- has been related to a dysfunction of anterior cingulate cortex , amygdala , and prefrontal cortex and has been associated clinically with impulsivity , affective instability , and significant interpersonal distress .

17872400|The amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- are often thought of as components of a neural circuit that assigns affective significance -- or value -- to sensory stimuli so as to anticipate future events and adjust behavioral and physiological responses .

17846154|Orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala contributions to affect and action in primates . .

17804525|In contrast , the growing aversion toward the action during the second phase of the satiation process is predicted to be correlated with an increase in activity in brain regions associated with unpleasant affect and volitional control , such as the amygdala , the anterior insula , and the anterior cingulate cortex .

17719567|However , it is not yet clear whether this bias represents 1 -RRB- impaired top-down cognitive control over affective responses , potentially linked to deficits in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex function ; or 2 -RRB- enhanced bottom-up responses to affectively laden stimuli that dysregulate cognitive control mechanisms , potentially linked to deficits in amygdala and anterior cingulate function .

17715054|Prior work has shown that structural variants differentially affect function of the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- VMPFC -RRB- , regions important for the regulation and expression of emotion .

17712272|We employed magnetoencephalography -LRB- MEG -RRB- to examine amygdala activity during a linguistic affective priming task .

17699669|Furthermore , during an effortful affective reappraisal task , nondepressed individuals showed an inverse relationship between activation in left ventrolateral PFC and the amygdala that is mediated by the ventromedial PFC -LRB- VMPFC -RRB- .

17698997|The results are contrasted with those that show the importance of the OFC in suppressing positive affective responses elicited by the amygdala in response to a conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- .

17681357|Of these structures , particularly the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex have been previously associated with decisions about affective interference .

17681356|Recent research on affective processing has suggested that low spatial frequency information of fearful faces provide rapid emotional cues to the amygdala , whereas high spatial frequencies convey fine-grained information to the fusiform gyrus , regardless of emotional expression .

17639784|A prominent increase in FRA expression also affected at the reentry some components of the amygdaloid complex , particularly the CeA .

17634566|After controlling for multiple individual difference measures , dispositional mindfulness was associated with greater widespread prefrontal cortical activation , and reduced bilateral amygdala activity during affect labeling , compared with the gender labeling control task .

17610388|However , investigations into the neurobiology of affective dysfunction show abnormal amygdala activation in schizophrenia during affect recognition tasks .

17604355|For example , the perirhinal cortex has strong reciprocal connections with the amygdala , which suggest involvement in processing affective stimuli .

17596455|Interaction between the entorhinal cortex -LRB- EC -RRB- and basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- may be a fundamental component in the consolidation of many forms of affective memory , such as inhibitory avoidance .

17596455|This effect of DA on affective behaviors may be accomplished in part through modulation of amygdala inputs .

17596455|Functionally , by enhancement of amygdala inputs that arrive in concert with other inputs , or during depolarized states , DA can facilitate the impact of affect on memory in a subset of conditions .

17578917|Placebo treatment affected endogenous opioid activity in a number of predicted mu-opioid receptor-rich regions that play central roles in pain and affect , including periaqueductal gray and nearby dorsal raphe and nucleus cuneiformis , amygdala , orbitofrontal cortex , insula , rostral anterior cingulate , and lateral prefrontal cortex .

17576282|Putting feelings into words : affect labeling disrupts amygdala activity in response to affective stimuli . .

17576282|The results indicated that affect labeling , relative to other forms of encoding , diminished the response of the amygdala and other limbic regions to negative emotional images .

17576282|Finally , RVLPFC and amygdala activity during affect labeling were inversely correlated , a relationship that was mediated by activity in medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- MPFC -RRB- .

17576282|These results suggest that affect labeling may diminish emotional reactivity along a pathway from RVLPFC to MPFC to the amygdala .

17561849|None of the lesions affected concurrent discrimination learning , but animals with neurotoxic amygdala or aspiration orbital frontal lesions could not refrain from displacing items covering devalued foods .

17561824|Stress affects amygdalar synaptic plasticity and several neurotransmitter systems have been implicated in stress-mediated changes in the brain , including the glutamatergic system .

17550594|The amygdala plays an important role in affective states and disorders such as anxiety and depression .

17550594|The amygdala is also emerging as a neural substrate of pain affect .

17547581|Greater responsiveness to fear with hippocampal activation in patients perhaps reflects recollection of traumatic events associated with past experiences of illness or simply the use of a more mnemonic -LRB- hippocampal -RRB- as opposed to affective -LRB- amygdala -RRB- approach when performing the task .

17521489|Future studies should address whether those deficits are related to the behavioral characteristics of affective dysregulation and/or impulsivity , to the proposed dysfunctions and reduced volume of the orbitofrontal cortex and/or the amygdala , and to other neuropsychological functions .

17512756|By contrast , frontal lobes , amygdala , and cingulate gyrus are relatively preserved or even enlarged , consistent with unusual affect regulation and language production in WS .

17466022|By increasing the strength of conditioning , we observed that stronger fear memories are affected by the combined but not independent amygdala and cerebellar blockade .

17395574|Both can affect visual cortex , but can reflect influences from different regions , such as fronto-parietal circuits versus the amygdala .

17392412|A major site of extrahypothalamic expression of CRF and its G-protein-coupled receptors is the amygdala , a key player in affect-related disorders such as anxiety .

17392412|The laterocapsular division of the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeLC -RRB- is important for the modulation of pain affect .

17368617|Chronic restraint stress affects hippocampal and amygdalar synaptic plasticity as determined by electrophysiological , morphological and behavioral measures , changes that are inhibited by some but not all antidepressants .

17360582|Other behaviors were not affected , thus revealing specific roles for amygdala OTR in female social recognition potentially mediated by anxiety in a social context .

17360224|Based on the neuroanatomical connections of the amygdala , we suggest that the amygdala is acting to increase neural activity in the fusiform gyrus , thereby increasing the likelihood that visual representations that have affective value reach awareness .

17359942|We observed the activation of the amygdala during the imagining of emotional facial affect versus the imagining of neutral facial affects .

17354075|The amygdalae are involved in both cognitive and affective aspects .

17351536|Other pathways project directly to the anterior cingulate cortex , the insula , the amygdala and to the prefrontal cortices , which are structures involved in the affective dimension of pain -LRB- unpleasantness of pain and regulation of autonomic and behavioral responses -RRB- .

17348015|The amygdala complex participates in multiple systems having to do with affective processes .

17339967|An interaction between happy faces and negative context was also observed in bilateral amygdala suggesting that the amygdala may act to prime or tag affective value to faces .

17319280|The amygdala was also most severely affected by neuronal loss , and the other limbic areas and neocortex were affected to a lesser degree .

17301163|Importantly , blockade of ERK activation in the amygdala did not affect responses to acute noxious stimuli in the absence of inflammation , indicating that modulation of nociceptive responses by amygdala ERK activation is specific to the persistent inflammatory state .

17292560|The hypothesis is based on recent improvements in the understanding of pain processing pathways in the central nervous system , and in particular the role of limbic structures , especially the anterior cingulate cortex , hippocampus and amygdala , in chronic and affective pain perception .

17289000|Although ethanol and ETX are known to affect amygdala neurons , involvement of the amygdala in the network subserving AGS is unclear .

17289000|Since ethanol and ETX affect N-methyl-d-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- receptors in the amygdala , the present study evaluated the effect of focally microinjecting a NMDA antagonist into the amygdala of rats treated with a binge protocol -LRB- intragastric administration of ethanol 3 times daily for 4 days -RRB- .

17239513|The OFC , through extensive and complex interconnections with several brain structures with putative role in pathophysiology of schizophrenia including amygdala , hippocampus , thalamus , DLPFC , and superior temporal lobe , may mediate schizophrenia symptoms such as blunting of emotional affect and impaired social functioning .

17222517|In addition , BMS affected brain monoaminergic levels mainly in the amygdala .

17182226|Significant correlations were found between amygdala responses to masked negative facial expressions and negative evaluation shifts elicited by the corresponding emotion quality in the affective priming task .

17182226|This finding might shed some light on how amygdala hyperresponsivity contributes to negative cognitive biases commonly observed in affective disorders .

17177602|Antibodies specifically affect the amygdala in a mouse model of systemic lupus erythematosus -LRB- SLE -RRB- .

17161828|These findings support the notion that negative -LRB- and possibly positive -RRB- biologically relevant stimuli can be nonconsciously processed , presumably via amygdala activation , and can affect behavioral responding .

17157270|Functional MRI was used to assess amygdala activation during the presentation of a fixation cross or affectively aversive or neutral visual stimuli in 29 healthy men .

17156152|As both are episodic disorders of affect regulation , the common pathophysiological mechanism is likely to involve deficits in amygdala-mediated , plasticity-dependent emotional conditioning .

17133391|The present study demonstrates that amygdala responses to threat-related stimuli can be controlled through the use of cognitive strategies depending on recruitment of prefrontal areas , thereby changing the subject 's affective state .

17123554|Here , we employed whole-cell patch-clamp techniques in acute brain slices , and electrical afferent and infrared-guided laser stimulation to examine how N -LRB- 2 -RRB- O -LRB- 65 % -RRB- can affect NMDA receptor -LRB- NMDAR -RRB- - mediated synaptic transmission to principal neurons -LRB- PNs -RRB- of the adult murine basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

17112504|However , endomorphin-1 -LRB- 32.6 nmol -RRB- or endomorphin-2 -LRB- 35.0 nmol -RRB- given into the basolateral site of amygdala did not affect the tail-flick latency .

17074446|The amygdala is important for the formation of emotions that are affected by olfactory information .

17067740|Overall brain activity for spontaneous pain of PHN involved affective and sensory-discriminative areas : thalamus , primary and secondary somatosensory , insula and anterior cingulate cortices , as well as areas involved in emotion , hedonics , reward , and punishment : ventral striatum , amygdala , orbital frontal cortex , and ventral tegmental area .

17067740|The sensory and affective activations only responded to the short-term treatment -LRB- 6h of Lidoderm -RRB- ; while the ventral striatum and amygdala -LRB- reward-related regions -RRB- decreased mainly with longer-term treatment -LRB- 2 weeks of Lidoderm -RRB- .

17062371|In particular , the amygdala is a region that is known to play a prominent role in the expression of emotions , and this function is believed to be disrupted in affective disorders and drug abuse .

17049177|The amygdala , which exerts a regulatory influence on the stress response , is itself affected by stress .

17048126|This stress-induced impairment in the noradrenergic facilitation of GABA release in the BLA may underlie the hyperexcitability of the amygdala in certain stress-related affective disorders , and may explain the stress-induced exacerbation of seizure activity in epileptic patients .

17032778|Life stress also differentially affected , as a function of serotonin transporter genotype , functional connectivity of the amygdala and hippocampus with a wide network of other regions , as well as gray matter structural features , and affected individuals ' level of rumination .

17027988|Consistent with this new concept and with a large volume of experimental data , I propose that awareness of intraoral food is related to the concomitant reverberant self-sustained activation of a coalition of neuronal subsets in agranular insula and orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- affect , hedonics -RRB- and agranular insula and perirhinal cortex -LRB- food identity -RRB- , as well as the amygdala -LRB- affect and identity -RRB- in humans .

17016713|Our results show that lorazepam did not affect risky behavior at 0.25 and 1 mg , but dose-dependently attenuated activation in -LRB- a -RRB- the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex during the response selection phase , and in -LRB- b -RRB- the bilateral insular cortex and amygdala during the outcome -LRB- i.e. , rewarded or punished -RRB- phase .

17015084|Moreover , implicit processing of affective intonation seems to be bound to subcortical regions mediating automatic induction of specific emotional reactions such as activation of the amygdala in response to fearful stimuli .

16997382|Recent advances in the functioning of the limbic system and the application of Geschwind 's concept of disconnection in the cortico-limbic networks , pointed the role of the amygdala and its connections with medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex , the same structures that are strictly interlinked with the neurobiology of emotions and affective disorders .

16996545|According to several functional imaging studies , the amygdala , which is localized in the temporal lobes of the brain , is an important structure for the automatic processing of affective stimuli .

16996545|To investigate how critical a role the amygdala plays in this process , we had 20 participants with unilateral resection of the temporal lobe and 20 controls perform an affective priming task .

16989896|Chronic modulation of GABA -LRB- A -RRB- receptor function by benzodiazepines or neuroactive steroids also affects Y -LRB- 1 -RRB- R expression in the amygdala , suggesting that a functional interaction between the GABA -LRB- A -RRB- receptor and Y -LRB- 1 -RRB- R mediated signalling may contribute to the regulation of emotional behaviour .

16983645|For MAOBKO mice , baclofen hindered the Amph-generated increases in motor cortical cAMP and pCREB , and amygdaloid pCREB , and the decrease in olfactory bulb pCREB , whereas did not affect the Amph-raised hippocampal pCREB .

16965855|To assess the relative contribution of amygdala GABA-A receptors in mediating sensory-discriminative and affective-motivational pain components , the GABA-A receptor agonist muscimol and the antagonist bicuculline -LRB- both 10-25 ng/microl -RRB- were administered by acute bilateral injection directly into the central amygdala in rats with a chronic constriction injury -LRB- CCI -RRB- .

16965855|Thus , amygdala GABA-A receptors appear to play an important role in sensory and especially affective pain processing in neuropathic rats .

16839779|We found out that in patients with Alzheimer disease , not only the lateral horns were significantly affected , but also the areas adjacent to the anterior corpus callosum , the splenium of the corpus callosum , the amygdala , the thalamus , the tale of the caudate nuclei -LRB- especially the left one -RRB- , and the head of the left caudate nucleus .

16837173|It was speculated that ECT affected both the prefrontal cortex , commonly assumed to be involved in depression , and the amygdala , known to play a central role in the processing of emotional stimuli , through the limbic-cortical-striatal-pallidal-thalamic circuit .

16815618|The amygdala has a role in the modulation of moods and emotion , processes that are known to be affected in people with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and depression .

16802879|The iSTART model shows how autistic behavioral symptoms may arise from prescribed breakdowns in these brain processes , notably a combination of underaroused emotional depression in the amygdala and related affective brain regions , learning of hyperspecific recognition categories in the temporal and prefrontal cortices , and breakdowns of adaptively timed attentional and motor circuits in the hippocampal system and cerebellum .

16782207|This study investigated cingulate cortex -LRB- CC -RRB- and amygdala response to fearful facial affect recognition in patients with panic disorder -LRB- PD -RRB- as measured by BOLD fMRI during the presentation of static facial images .

16678973|These results underscore the importance of circadian glucocorticoid signaling in Period2 rhythms in the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and central nucleus of the amygdala and suggest a novel mechanism whereby stressors , drugs of abuse , and other abnormal states that affect the patterns of circulating glucocorticoids can alter the functional output of these nuclei .

16624961|Among younger adults , the ability to willfully regulate negative affect , enabling effective responses to stressful experiences , engages regions of prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- and the amygdala .

16624961|Consistent with previous work in younger samples , increasing negative affect resulted in ventral lateral , dorsolateral , and dorsomedial regions of PFC and amygdala activation .

16624961|In contrast to previous work , decreasing negative affect did not produce the predicted robust pattern of higher PFC and lower amygdala activation .

16600519|These findings indicate that a subpopulation of serotonergic and nonserotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus cells may act to co-modulate processing in the vestibular nuclei and the central amygdaloid nucleus , regions implicated in the generation of emotional and affective responses to real and perceived motion .

16566949|However , to date evidence is lacking of a direct relationship between amygdala measures and behavioral manifestations of autism in affected individuals .

16540353|The reconsolidation hypothesis is supported by evidence that , under some conditions , post-retrieval treatments affecting amygdala and hippocampus functioning impair subsequent retention performance .

16527423|The projection from the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- conveys information about the affective significance of sensory stimuli to the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- .

16490367|This result suggests the amygdala is important for affective responsiveness to moral transgressions .

16476670|When retrieval of emotional information is relevant to current behavior , amygdala-hippocampal connectivity increases bidirectionally , under modulatory influences from orbitofrontal cortex , a region implicated in representation of affective value and behavioral guidance .

16476409|Future studies should clarify whether amygdala enlargement is a risk factor for MD in BPD patients or a consequence of the affective disorder .

16460727|5-HT1A receptor agonist affects fear conditioning through stimulations of the postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in the hippocampus and amygdala . .

16460693|Emotional disorders such as depression and anxiety have been associated with hyperactivity of the amygdala , but it is unknown whether antidepressant treatment directly affects amygdala responses to emotionally significant information .

16442081|Moreover , the 5-HTTLPR affects the development of a broader corticolimbic circuit and alters the functional integration of emotional information between the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex .

16423710|Within the amygdala , the basolateral nucleus -LRB- BLA -RRB- has an important role in regulating anxiety and affective responses .

16423710|During periods of stress , CRF is released into the amygdala and local CRF receptor activation has been postulated as a substrate for stress-induced alterations in affective behavior .

16393155|Our results indicate that FCs affected local circuits in the amygdala and possibly in the hippocampus but not circuits responsible for seizure generalization .

16373067|The basolateral complex -LRB- BLA -RRB- and the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- are believed to mediate the expression of affective responses .

16368249|Beyond threat : amygdala reactivity across multiple expressions of facial affect . .

16368249|The amygdala has been consistently isolated as a key neural substrate for processing facial displays of affect .

16364892|These GABA neurons mediate inhibition from cortical afferents to both the major input and output station of the amygdala , are inhibited during action of dopamine via D1 receptors , and are thus likely to represent important cellular players during dopaminergic disinhibition related to increased affective behavior .

16361941|How amygdala neurons are affected by facial identity and type of emotion , however , has not yet been systematically examined .

16356694|Behaviourally , animals lesioned in the amygdala displayed increased ambulatory activity both before and after puberty when exposed to a novel open field , while neonatal ventral hippocampal lesions did not affect adult exploratory behaviour as compared to sham controls .

16356694|Moreover , they suggest that this long-term effect depends on the primary area lesioned since only damage to the amygdala , and not to the ventral hippocampus , affects the functional organisation of the brain of the animals later in life .

16352388|Specifically , a lesion to the amygdala in combination with reduced interconnectivity with the prefrontal cortex is hypothesized to give rise to reduced emotional expression -LRB- affective flattening -RRB- and emotion recognition deficits .

16324692|Given the role of amygdalar endocannabinoids in the regulation of emotionality , this suggests that the ability of glucocorticoids to influence affective behavior may involve interactions with regulation of endocannabinoid content .

16291945|A key player in emotionality and affective disorders , the amygdala has been implicated in the well documented , but mechanistically unexplained , relationship between pain and affect .

16289282|We present evidence that specific areas of the prefrontal cortex -LRB- including the dorsolateral prefrontal , anterior cingulate , and orbitofrontal cortices -RRB- and limbic structures -LRB- including the amygdala , hippocampus and nucleus accumbens -RRB- are key regions associated with three fundamental dimensions of temperament : Negative Affect , Positive Affect , and Constraint .

16262209|Hyperresponsiveness of amygdala and other limbic structures may be related to affective instability , while structural and functional brain alterations underlie the cognitive disorganization in psychotic-like symptoms of schizotypal personality disorder .

16257239|We interpret the activation of the amygdala in this situation as reflecting the greater affective reaction when one is deceived oneself .

16253228|This learning process is mediated in part by muscarinic acetylcholine and dopaminergic inputs to the basolateral complex of the amygdala , as intra-amygdala infusion of selective receptor antagonists at the time of acquisition significantly affects reinstatement .

16252064|Until today , morphometric neuroimaging studies on affective disorders concentrate on the limbic system , especially the hippocampus , amygdala , and anterior cingulate .

16214306|Many other brain regions were not affected by the stimulation , including the hippocampal formation , medial nuclei of the amygdala , thalamus , and hypothalamus .

16180622|Individual differences in rumination correlated with increases in amygdala response when participants were increasing negative affect and with greater decreases in prefrontal regions implicated in self-focused thought when participants were decreasing negative affect .

16179807|These data identify a signaling pathway through which E2 increases BDNF expression that may underlie some actions of E2 on affective behavior and indicate neuroanatomical heterogeneity in the E2 effect within the amygdala and hippocampus .

15998203|Neonatal amygdala lesions affect appetitive motivational and consummatory aspects of social behavior in the rat . .

15978846|Despite no significant differences being found in the subjective ratings of affective pictures across three sessions , compared to placebo , acute treatments of DA D2 receptor antagonists and SSRIs commonly attenuated the amygdala activity , although both treatments had slightly different modulatory effects on other components of the neural circuit of emotional processing .

15968809|It is speculated that the amygdala is an important anatomic structure in the cerebral circuits that regulate mood in affective disorders but also in epilepsy , and an effect of AEDs on such circuits aids mood stability in both populations of patients .

15869522|In contrast , lesions to the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex and to the basolateral amygdala did not affect compulsive lever pressing .

15869492|However , there also was a recapitulation of emotional study context in the right amygdala during familiarity only , which might therefore be related to affective implicit memory .

15858833|Here we investigated whether ketamine also affects glutamatergic transmission between the basolateral amygdala and the nucleus accumbens .

15848808|Concurrent electrophysiological measurements identified a safety learning-induced long-lasting depression of CS-evoked activity in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala , consistent with fear reduction , and an increase of CS-evoked activity in a region of the striatum involved in positive affect , euphoric responses , and reward .

15845098|Down-regulation of amygdala preprotachykinin A mRNA but not 3H-SP receptor binding sites in subjects affected by mood disorders and schizophrenia . .

15813642|First , SP and NK1R are expressed in brain regions that are involved in stress , fear and affective response -LRB- e.g. amygdala , hippocampus , hypothalamus and frontal cortex -RRB- .

15800377|This study was designed to examine how corticotropin-releasing factor -LRB- CRF -RRB- neurons , together with substance P -LRB- SP -RRB- receptors in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus -LRB- PVN -RRB- , central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , and locus coeruleus -LRB- LC -RRB- , are affected by stress .

15780462|Conversely , amygdala lesions did not affect place learning ; however , these animals were impaired in their suppression of the fear response following repeated unpaired trials .

15772862|Furthermore , ATD modulated amygdala/hippocampus activation in response to fearful relative to happy faces as a function of self-reported threat sensitivity -LRB- as measured with the Behavioral Inhibition Scale ; Carver CS , White TL -LRB- 1994 -RRB- Behavioral inhibition , behavioral activation , and affective responses to impending reward and punishment : the BIS/BAS scales .

15753240|To determine whether these abnormalities also occur in response to overtly presented affective stimuli unrelated to trauma ; to examine the functional relationship between the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex and their relationship to PTSD symptom severity in response to these stimuli ; and to determine whether responsivity of these regions habituates normally across repeated stimulus presentations in PTSD .

15753240|These results provide evidence for exaggerated amygdala responsivity , diminished medial prefrontal cortex responsivity , and a reciprocal relationship between these 2 regions during passive viewing of overtly presented affective stimuli unrelated to trauma in PTSD .

15748151|Our results suggest that amygdala kindling may affects amino acid metabolism , but not energy metabolism .

15741749|This points to the role of the amygdala as an integrative brain structure , whose activation can be modulated by different affective styles .

15740991|The effects of identity on facial affect processing are discussed in the light of several hypotheses -LRB- a deficit of context processing , a global-local processing impairment or a selective attention deficit -RRB- , and may be related to frontal , prefrontal or amygdala dysfunctions .

No difference in height or extent of activation was detected between the two scanners in the amygdala during affect processing .

12724177|The associations between the amygdala and affective disorders , notably dysthymia and euphoria , are also discussed .

12724174|The primary transmitter deficit is cholinergic in Alzheimer 's disease -LRB- AD -RRB- , and the amygdala receives a major cholinergic projection from the nucleus basalis of Meynert -LRB- Ch4 -RRB- , which may play an important role in the retention of affective conditioning and/or memory consolidation .

12724166|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- complex plays a critical role in this behavior , because permanent lesions or reversible pharmacologic inactivation of the BLA attenuates conditioned-cued reinstatement without affecting cocaine self-administration or cocaine-primed reinstatement .

12724162|We hypothesize that the basolateral amygdala is required for a conditioned stimulus to gain access to the current affective value of its specific unconditioned stimulus , whereas the central nucleus mediates stimulus-response representations and conditioned motivational influences on behavior .

12724162|In many circumstances , then , emotional behavior can be seen as a coordinated combination of processing by these amygdaloid sub-nuclei , reflecting the superimposition of a phylogenetically recent basolateral amygdala subsystem that encodes and retrieves the affective value of environmental stimuli and thereby directs complex , adaptive behavioral responses onto a phylogenetically older central amygdala subsystem that enables cortical structures -LRB- including the basolateral amygdala -RRB- to recruit incentive motivational processes and thereby invigorate emotional responding .

12493624|The present study evaluated the contribution of the amygdala in modulating the affective response of rats to noxious stimulation .

12493624|The present results provide further evidence for the preferential involvement of the amygdala in modulation of the affective component of the pain experience .

12482086|These results suggest that the human amygdala shows a stronger response to affective facial expressions than to scenes , a bias that should be considered in the design of experimental paradigms interested in probing amygdala function .

12474867|The following neural structures are reviewed as each has been shown to affect food intake in birds or in mammals : ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus -LRB- n. -RRB- , lateral hypothalamic area , paraventricular hypothalamic n. , n. tractus solitarius and area postrema , amygdala , parabrachial n. , arcuate n. and bed n. of the stria terminalis .

12470879|These results suggest that the central nucleus of the amygdala , rather than the basolateral nucleus , plays a crucial role in the negative affective component of morphine abstinence .

12460694|We speculate that anticipatory anxiety in social phobics originates in an affect sensitive fear network encompassing the amygdaloid-hippocampal region , prefrontal , and temporal areas .

12460607|Our previous studies showed that infusion of the neurotrophin nerve growth factor accelerated the behavioral progression of amygdala kindling and affected kindling-induced structural changes in the brain , whereas intrahilar infusion of another neurotrophin , brain-derived neurotrophic factor , delayed amygdala kindling-induced seizure development and reduced the growth in afterdischarge duration , but had little effect on kindling-induced structural changes .

12438930|Up-regulation of addicsin expression by morphine may affect glutamate uptake in the amygdala , causing mice to develop morphine tolerance and dependence .

12393241|The results show that infusion of the devazepide -LRB- 10 microg -RRB- into the nucleus accumbens significantly inhibited the cocaine-induced reinstatement of CPP , while infusion of devazepide -LRB- 1 and 10 microg -RRB- into amygdala did not affect cocaine-induced reactivation of CPP .

12377358|Neuropeptide Y administration into the amygdala does not affect ethanol consumption . .

12210940|The MESBAC sequence will be particularly useful for pharmacological and affective fMRI studies in brain regions such as the OFC , nucleus accumbens , amygdala , parahippocampus , etc. .

12207948|Anisomycin treatment paradigm affects duration of long-term potentiation in slices of the amygdala . .

12203669|Specific brain areas that play an important role in a variety of types of memory are also preferentially affected by stress , including hippocampus , amygdala , medial prefrontal cortex , and cingulate .

12193196|Thus , our results further support a physiological role for synaptically released histamine , that in addition to affecting cholinergic transmission in the amygdala , modulates consolidation of fear memories

12191458|This increase in amygdalar signal due to the active maintenance of negative emotion was significantly correlated with subjects ' self-reported dispositional levels of negative affect .

12177408|The patient , R.M. , had extensive bilateral limbic system damage , affecting orbitofrontal cortex , temporal pole , and amygdala .

12167256|Evidence of intact dispositional affect in patients with amygdala lesions . .

12167256|It is thought that the human amygdala is a critical component of the neural substrates of emotional experience , involved particularly in the generation of fear , anxiety , and general negative affectivity .

12167256|In a preliminary test of the amygdala 's role in phenomenal affective states , we assessed the extent of experienced positive and negative affective states in patients with amygdala damage and age - , sex - , and education-matched controls .

12167256|In the first study , we examined the effects of amygdala lesions on affective traits in 10 left and 10 right amygdala-damaged patients , 1 patient with bilateral amygdala damage -LRB- SP -RRB- , and 20 control subjects .

12167256|In a second study , we examined more closely the effects of bilateral amygdala damage on the day-to-day generation of affective states by administering the PANAS daily for a 30-day period to patient SP and age - , sex - , and education-matched controls .

12167256|In both experiments , no differences in the magnitude and frequency of self-reported positive or negative affect were found between control subjects and patients with amygdala damage .

12167256|A highly similar two-factor description of experienced affect was found in patients with amygdala lesions .

12167256|This suggests that the underlying structure of affective states was intact following amygdala damage .

12167256|It is concluded that the human amygdala may be recruited during phenomenal affective states in the intact brain , but is not necessary for the production of these states .

12153540|Here we show that mecamylamine-precipitated nicotine withdrawal in the rat is characterized by an increase in thigmotaxis -LRB- time spent in the periphery of an open field -RRB- that may be indicative of behavioural distress and can be associated with a selective up-regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity in the amygdala , a region implicated in the regulation of negative affect in response to aversive stimuli , including withdrawal .

12151561|Unlike the hippocampus , relatively little is known about how stress affects the amygdala and the nature of its role in the stress response .

12151561|These findings raise the possibility that certain forms of chronic stress , by affecting specific neuronal elements in the amygdala , may lead to behavioral manifestations of enhanced emotionality .

12151561|Thus , stress-induced structural plasticity in amygdala neurons may provide a candidate cellular substrate for affective disorders triggered by chronic stress .

12126877|Although the precise mechanisms are not clear , and the involvement of noradrenergic systems can not be precluded , data are consistent with the idea that dopamine , released in response to a stressful experience for example , interacts with CRH and neurotensin in the extended amygdala to affect emotional responsiveness .

12099486|The dissociation with reduced activity in the left amygdala and the right parahippocampal gyrus may suggest that aging differentially affects neural responses to faces with negative or positive emotional valence .

12094212|Indeed , the amygdala 's role in stimulus-reward learning might be just as important as its role in processing negative affect and fear conditioning .

12023059|Volumes and asymmetries of the amygdala-hippocampus-complex -LRB- AHC -RRB- and sylvian fissure -LRB- SF -RRB- were determined using magnetic resonance imaging of subjects with schizophrenia from 12 uniaffected and 14 multiply affected families , and ten healthy controls .

11932071|Microinjection of morphine into various amygdaloid nuclei differentially affects nociceptive responsiveness and RVM neuronal activity . .

11932071|The goal of the present study was to identify nuclei of the amygdala in which opioid-sensitive systems can act to recruit nociceptive modulatory circuitry in the rostral ventromedial medulla -LRB- RVM -RRB- and affect nociceptive responsiveness .

11904753|In contrast , the affected family member was an 83-year-old man whose brain had neuronal loss , gliosis and Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra and other monoaminergic brain stem nuclei , as well as the basal forebrain and amygdala .

11888561|Estrous cycle and food availability affect feeding induced by amygdala 5-HT receptor blockade . .

11808812|The areas affected are the amygdala , cingulum and orbito-frontal cortex .

11790514|The current experiments examined the effects of acute or repeated , intermittent administrations of cocaine on the acquisition and reversal of object discriminations by Vervet monkeys in order to test the hypothesis that cocaine treatment affects performance of tasks that depend upon the functions of the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala .

11790421|P , unlike MPA , did not affect the nuclear uptake of -LSB- 3H -RSB- androgens by brain , but reduced by 80 % the nuclear accumulation of -LSB- 3H -RSB- E -LRB- 2 -RRB- in tissue samples containing preoptic area and the anterior part of the bed nucleus of stria terminalis , although not in samples from hypothalamus or amygdala .

11788046|Comparing affected and unaffected brain regions in nine controls and six AD cases , we showed that 118 of the 7050 sequences on a broadly representative cDNA microarray were differentially expressed in the amygdala and cingulate cortex , two regions affected early in the disease .

11756516|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is believed to be involved in schizophrenia , depression , and other disorders that display affective components .

11755692|Chemical stimulation with histamine of only hippocampus or amygdala affected selectively the escape latency .

11695953|Our results suggest that amygdala function is affected in both anxiety and depression during childhood and adolescence .

11748597|We suggest that this integration can then lead to a reduction in the strength of hippocampally mediated episodic memories of the traumatic event as well as the memories ' associated , amygdala-dependent , negative affect .

11746732|Our results suggest that GABAergic neurons in the BL of the rat amygdala might be affected by the excitatory influence of the noradrenergic system and the inhibitory influence of the GABAergic system .

11741029|The amygdala exerts a general modulatory influence on memory storage processes related , in part , to an organism 's level of affective or emotional arousal .

11741029|Moreover , affective state can influence the use of different memory systems , and the amygdala may mediate this effect of emotion on memory .

11727218|Thus , the amygdala complex , a structure related to processes of memory and emotional control , is severely affected in this disease from the initial stages .

11704074|Compared with criminal nonpsychopaths and noncriminal control participants , criminal psychopaths showed significantly less affect-related activity in the amygdala/hippocampal formation , parahippocampal gyrus , ventral striatum , and in the anterior and posterior cingulate gyri .

11698612|We found that basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- lesions did not affect the ability of rats to learn a basic instrumental conditional discrimination , but did disrupt the ability of differential outcomes to facilitate acquisition .

11588616|Estrogen affects the expression of Ca2 + / calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV in amygdala . .

11587889|Using low-noise functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- , we investigated in which way the amygdala , auditory cortex and insula are involved in the processing of affective nonverbal vocalizations -LRB- Laughing and Crying -RRB- in healthy humans .

11568425|Differential contribution of right and left amygdala to affective information processing . .

11568425|In spite of this , the following tentative proposals are made : the left amygdala is more closely related to affective information encoding with a higher affinity to language and to detailed feature extraction , and the right amygdala to affective information retrieval with a higher affinity to pictorial or image-related material .

11568425|Furthermore , the right amygdala may be more strongly engaged than the left one in a fast , shallow or gross analysis of affect-related information .

11567067|A relatively large body of evidence supports the view that the amygdala -LRB- and in particular the basolateral area -RRB- contributes to conditioned reinforcement by maintaining a representation of the affective value of conditioned stimuli .

11567067|These data confirm that the amygdala is critical for the conditioned reinforcement process in primates , and taken together with other recent work in monkeys , these results suggest that the contribution of the amygdala is to provide the affective value of specific reinforcers as accessed by associated conditioned stimuli .

11522965|To determine whether the amygdala 's role in affective processing extends beyond negative stimuli , subjects viewed pictures that varied in emotional content -LRB- positive vs negative valence -RRB- and arousal level -LRB- high vs low -RRB- while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging .

11498998|The characteristics of on-off responses of medial geniculate body -LRB- MGB -RRB- neurons to tone bursts of varying frequency , intensity and duration were affected by lateral amygdaloid nucleus -LRB- LAm -RRB- stimulation , which was in form of altering the pattern of discharge or complete suppression .

11498423|Gender did not affect right-to-left amygdalar and hippocampal volume ratios in right - or left-handed participants .

11498423|Handedness , but not gender , seems to affect right-to-left amygdalar and hippocampal volume ratios .

11496145|Sex differences in amygdala activation during the perception of facial affect . .

11496145|These findings suggest that the lateralization of affective function may extend beyond the cortex to subcortical regions such as the amygdala .

11459929|Three of the four human receptors from this family are present in the amygdala , possibly linking trace amine receptors to affective disorders .

11445626|These findings are consistent with cognitive functions and affective/emotional states associated with conduction pathways of the hypothalamus involving cortical association areas and amygdala and hippocampal formation .

11430815|Activation of fusiform gyri by faces was strongly affected by attentional condition , but the left amygdala response to fearful faces was not .

11409730|These results extend previous neuroimaging findings in healthy subjects indicating a role for the amygdala in transient negative emotional states , and suggest that this multimodal brain region also is involved in more durable negative affects such as dispositional pessimism .

11356897|The basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- plays a significant role in affective behavior that is likely regulated by afferents from the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- .

11356897|Thus , the mPFC may attenuate sensory-driven amygdala-mediated affective responses via recruitment of BLA inhibitory interneurons that suppress sensory cortical inputs .

11357132|All patients comprehend normally the affective meaning of the stimulus events , despite the lack of evidence for enhanced perceptual encoding of these events in patients with left amygdala lesions .

11353739|One proposal is that this residual ability -LRB- affective '' blindsight '' -RRB- depends on a subcortical visual pathway comprising the superior colliculus , posterior -LRB- extrageniculate -RRB- thalamus and amygdala .

11337083|CRH levels in the amygdala in vitro are affected by some of the same stimuli that regulate hypothalamic CRH ; however there is evidence supporting differential regulation of CRH in these two brain regions by some of the same stimuli .

11334226|L-Lysine and L-histidine -LRB- both up to 1,000 mg/kg -RRB- did not affect amygdala-kindled seizures in rats .

11312312|Lateral amygdalar neurons showed gradual development of discrimination that was not significantly affected by the lesions .

11310620|All left anterior temporal lobe structures were affected in semantic dementia , with the entorhinal cortex , amygdala , middle and inferior temporal gyri , and fusiform gyrus the most severely damaged .

11280935|Individual differences in this circuitry are reviewed , with an emphasis on asymmetries within the PFC and activation of the amygdala as 2 key components of affective style .

11251212|These results suggest that cadmium released from the amygdalar neuron terminals affect the degree and balance of excitation-inhibition in synaptic neurotransmission .

11249801|The data indicate that in adult subjects with bipolar affective disorder , there is a reduction in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation and an increase in amygdalar activation in response to fearful facial affect .

11248000|We also conclude that the amygdala is activated not only by an affectively unpleasant taste , but also by a taste that is affectively pleasant , thus providing evidence that the amygdala is involved in effects produced by positively affective as well as by negatively affective stimuli .

11239901|The amygdala plays a central role in the human response to affective or emotionally charged stimuli , particularly fear-producing stimuli .

11226813|Glutamate receptor antagonists differentially affect the protective activity of conventional antiepileptics against amygdala-kindled seizures in rats . .

11209962|Sex-specific developmental changes in amygdala responses to affective faces . .

11189015|There is also good evidence for a role of vagal afferents in nociception , as manifested by affective-emotional responses such as increased blood pressure and tachycardia , typically associated with the perception of pain , and mediated via central reflex pathways involving the amygdala and other parts of the limbic system .

11173084|HPLC analysis showed reduction of 5-HT content in the midbrain and amygdala , reduction of 5-HIAA content in pons , increased 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio in the hippocampus and increased DOPAC/DA ratio in the hypothalamus , midbrain , hippocampus and pons without affecting the MHPG/NA ratio and NA content .

11163282|Finally , during NREM sleep , the left amygdala and the left prefrontal cortex were more activated by stimuli having special affective significance than by neutral stimuli .

11160948|These findings support the view that attention is controlled by neural mechanisms involving not only frontoparietal areas but also limbic components in cingulate cortex and amygdala , which may interact with ventral visual areas in the temporal lobe to detect affective value and prioritize attention to salient stimuli .

11160452|Environmental novelty differentially affects c-fos mRNA expression induced by amphetamine or cocaine in subregions of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and amygdala . .

11160446|A dynamic interaction between the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- , amygdala , and nucleus accumbens -LRB- NAc -RRB- may be fundamental to regulation of goal-directed behavior by affective and cognitive processes .

11157555|The former may require cognitive processes of the lateral and superior medial frontal regions , the latter affective connections of the ventral medial frontal with amygdala and other limbic regions .

11102635|Other areas that might be affected included the hippocampus , thalamus , amygdaloid complex , piriform cortex , dorsal caudatoputamen , and lateral ventricular wall .

11083167|The authors conclude that subjective memory complaints in depressed patients do not translate into a clinical picture of dementia , but that abnormalities in the amygdala and hippocampus may be relevant in explaining affective and cognitive symptoms .

11081801|First , of 710 amygdalar neurons tested , 129 -LRB- 18.2 % -RRB- responded to single sensory stimulation -LRB- 48 to vision , 32 to audition , 49 to ingestion -RRB- , 142 -LRB- 20 % -RRB- to multimodal stimulation , and 20 to only one item with affective significance .

11081801|These results suggest that the amygdala might be important in ongoing recognition of the affective significance of complex stimuli -LRB- food-nonfood discrimination -RRB- .

11079781|These amygdala nuclei appeared to be more severely affected compared to the adjacent entorhinal region .

10982493|These findings indicate that the amygdala plays an important role in such affective face processing in children , similar to the patterns of activation observed in adults .

10982493|Moreover , one study has reported abnormalities in amygdala activation during a task requiring the judgment of affective intent from the eye region of the face in subjects with autism .

10978698|Intentional sheltering was shown to attenuate the expression of the CP-related Fos-Li activity within the locus coeruleus -LRB- LC -RRB- without affecting that of the structures known preferentially to process nociceptive inputs of bladder origin -LRB- dorsal vagal complex , ventrocaudal bulbar reticular formation , nucleus centralis of amygdala , dorsolateral portion of bed nucleus of stria terminalis -RRB- .

10974353|These findings suggest that lasting change in affect produced by kindling depends on LTP of right amygdala efferent transmission to PAG , replicating studies of the effects of FG-7142 on brain and behavior in the cat .

10974353|Taken together , the findings of both studies support the hypothesis that a form of LTP of specific amygdala circuits underlies lasting changes in affect produced by limbic kindling .

10943684|The present results suggest that amygdala responses to human face stimuli are affected by the relationship between the perceived race of the stimulus face and that of the subject .

10903405|This article models how emotional centers of the brain , such as the amygdala , interact with sensory and prefrontal cortices -LRB- notably ventral , or orbital , prefrontal cortex -RRB- to generate affective states , attend to motivationally salient sensory events , and elicit motivated behaviors .

10770231|Parallel to earlier neuroimaging findings , our results show brain activity in the amygdala of males during negative affect .

10758344|It is hypothesized that the Pb-induced associative deficit may reflect lasting damage to the amygdala and/or nucleus accumbens , which comprise a system thought to modulate the process by which environmental cues acquire affective significance .

10683412|In addition , the involvement of the basolateral amygdala in affective processes has been reported by several authors .

10683412|Thus , in the present work we studied the regulation by the basolateral amygdala of affective dopaminergic responses in the two parts of the nucleus accumbens -LRB- core and shell -RRB- and the ventromedial dorsal striatum .

10683412|The results obtained suggest a specific regulation of affective dopaminergic responses in the two parts of the nucleus accumbens by the basolateral amygdala and a lack of influence of the basolateral amygdala on the ventromedial dorsal striatum .

10683412|The results suggest that attraction or aversion toward a stimulus are correlated with dopamine variations in the core of the nucleus accumbens and that the basolateral amygdala controls affective behavioural responses .

10665823|As the amygdala is critically involved in the affective coloring of sensory stimuli , the increase in T3 concentrations in the mitochondria of this brain region may be of relevance for the mechanism of action of anti-depressant drugs .

10648432|The amygdala play a crucial role in the affective evaluation of multimodal sensory input and the neurobiological mediation of aggressive behaviour .

10648432|With hippocampal sclerosis , in the context of mesial temporal lobe sclerosis , being the most common cause of temporal lobe epilepsy , we hypothesized that the amygdala might be affected by the same pathogenic process in aggressive patients .

10648432|Another subgroup of aggressive patients -LRB- 28 % -RRB- had different left temporal lesions affecting either the amygdala or periamygdaloid structures .

10636303|Because these D1CT mice express CT in the piriform cortex and amygdala -LRB- major cognitive and affective olfactory processing areas -RRB- it was tested whether abnormal odor perception , discrimination , or responsiveness facilitates their compulsion-like behavior .

10632099|In addition , the right temporal pole -LRB- Brodmann area 38 -RRB- , the ventromedial frontal cortex -LRB- Brodmann area 11/32 -RRB- bilaterally , and the amygdaloid complex were affected , but no significant atrophy was measured in the hippocampus , entorhinal , or caudal perirhinal cortex .

10627089|Although Fos-ir positive cells were found in the posterodorsal part of the medial amygdaloid nucleus and in the posteromedial cortical amygdaloid nucleus , which are terminals of the neuronal projections from the main and accessory olfactory bulbs , the numbers of Fos-ir cells in those nuclei were not affected by exposure to female-soiled bedding .

10594092|The other , based on studies using Pavlovian fear conditioning , hypothesizes that fear learning occurs in the amygdala , and post-training manipulations after acquisition will not affect memory consolidation .

10594092|These findings indicate that synaptic activity in LBA is necessary during learning , but that amygdala inactivation directly after training does not affect memory consolidation .

10594083|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is implicated in responding to affective stimuli .

10489263|The present series of studies reevaluated the role of the amygdala in taste aversion learning by examining the extent to which conditioning methods , testing methods and lesioning methods , influence whether amygdala lesions dramatically affect conditioned taste aversion -LRB- CTA -RRB- learning .

10482807|These findings suggest that lasting change in affect following partial hippocampal kindling depends on LTP of right amygdala efferent transmission to PAG .

10415675|We then go on to describe the results of some investigations using the MRI to examine amygdala pathology in a group of patients presenting with affective aggression in comparison with a control group .

10415650|Interpreted in the context of opiate abuse , microR opioids in the VP may serve to diminish the influence of reinforcement -LRB- ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens -RRB- in the transduction of cognition -LRB- prefrontal cortex -RRB- and affect -LRB- amygdala -RRB- into behavior .

10405084|The hippocampus , amygdala and related functional circuits have been implicated in the regulation of emotional expression and memory processes , which are affected in major depression .

10379523|Based on anatomical connections with limbic areas , the extended amygdala has been proposed to play an important role in cognitive and affective processes .

10373247|The involvement of dopaminergic projection to the central amygdala in the facilitatory effect of cholecystokinin unsulphated octapeptide -LRB- CCK-8US -RRB- and caerulein -LRB- CER -RRB- on memory motivated affectively was investigated in male rats .

10373247|These results may indicate that the facilitatory effect of CCK-8US and CER on memory motivated affectively is mediated by dopaminergic projection from ventral tegmental area to the central amygdala .

10368863|The present review discusses several important brain structures and neuroanatomic pathways thought to be involved in affect and mood disorders , including the amygdala , frontal neocortex , cingulate gyrus , basal ganglia , and the monoamine systems .

10234222|The amygdala has been consistently identified as playing a crucial role in both the perception of emotional cues and the production of emotional responses , with some evidence suggesting that it is particularly involved with fear-related negative affect .

10234222|Individual differences in amygdala activation are implicated in dispositional affective styles and increased reactivity to negative incentives .

10224295|Importantly , our results demonstrate that like the hippocampus , the amygdala is a sub-cortical structure particularly sensitive to the effects of mild brain trauma and underline the fact that cerebral regions distant from the location of the fluid impact can be affected .

10210038|Bilateral lesions of the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala of WAG/Rij rats completely prevent the pressor response to 0.5 nmol of bicuculline , whereas unilateral lesion of the basolateral nucleus does not affect blood pressure changes in epileptic WAG/Rij rats .

10051203|However , basal expression of corticotropin-releasing factor messenger RNA across the brain -LRB- bed nucleus of the stria terminalis , medial preoptic area , paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus , central nucleus of the amygdala , etc. -RRB- was not affected by the para-chlorophenylalanine treatment .

9893154|In addition , recent data reveal important bidirectional interactions between stress-system hormonal factors in depression and neural substrates implicated in many discrete behavioral alterations in depression -LRB- e.g. , the medial prefrontal cortex , important in shifting affect based on internal and external cues , the mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system , and the amygdala fear system -RRB- .

9888622|Dopaminergic cell bodies located within the ventral mesencephalon innervate the amygdaloid complex , a region critically involved in the attribution of affective significance to environmental stimuli .

9853119|The possibility that chronic exposure to power-line frequency -LRB- 50 Hz -RRB- magnetic fields -LRB- MFs -RRB- might affect the acquisition or characteristics of focal and generalized seizures in amygdala kindled rats was studied .

9850979|Results show brain activity in the amygdala of normal controls during negative affect , which is in line with previous neuroimaging findings .

9850979|Unlike controls , schizophrenic patients have not demonstrated amygdala activation during sadness despite matched ratings to normal controls indicating a similar negative affect .

9835390|Lesions in other structures such as the medial frontal cortex and the amygdala only affected spatial learning in the C57 strain .

9831467|Metabolic rate in the right amygdala predicts negative affect in depressed patients . .

9831467|Within the depressed groups , right amygdalar rCMRglu was positively correlated with negative affect .

9831467|Thalamic rCMRglu was not related to negative affect , and amygdalar rCMRglu accounted for a significant portion of variance in depressives ' negative affect scores over and above the contribution of thalamic rCMRglu .

9821068|For example , damage to the amygdala may be associated with an impaired ability to recognized emotional faces and a reduction of affect , especially anger , rage , and fear .

9809644|EB did not affect alphaMSH in extra-hypothalamic areas , but addition of progesterone , raised levels in the septum , amygdala , hippocampus and caudate putamen .

9801389|The lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- receives excitatory -LRB- glutamatergic -RRB- inputs from thalamic and cortical sensory processing areas and is believed to be involved in evaluation of the affective significance of sensory events .

9768464|Glucose metabolism was assessed using positron emission tomography in 41 comparisons , 15 predatory murderers , and nine affective murderers in left and right hemisphere prefrontal -LRB- medial and lateral -RRB- and subcortical -LRB- amygdala , midbrain , hippocampus , and thalamus -RRB- regions .

9767150|These experiments used in vivo microdialysis and high-performance liquid chromatography to examine , in rats , norepinephrine -LRB- NE -RRB- release in the amygdala induced by footshock and systemic administration of drugs affecting the opioid peptidergic system .

9766770|Both the patients with schizophrenia and those with affective psychosis had significant left-less-than-right asymmetry of the posterior amygdala-hippocampal complex .

9761324|Moreover , recent data from rodents and nonhuman primates suggest that structural and functional alterations caused by seizure activity originating in the amygdala are not limited to the amygdala itself , but may also affect other temporal lobe structures .

9749708|We conclude that footshock stress produces general long-lasting changes in amygdala auditory field potentials that are not significantly affected by contextual fear conditioning .

9697155|The involvement of a dopaminergic projection arriving at the central amygdala -LRB- CA -RRB- in angiotensin II -LRB- AII -RRB- facilitation of affectively motivated memory was investigated in male rats .

9593925|The expression of the neuronal isoform , GLUT3 , was enhanced in penumbral regions , such as piriform cortex and amygdala , but was rapidly reduced in the affected areas of cortex , hippocampus and thalamus , reflecting necrosis .

9629848|Quantitative analysis of brain anatomy revealed that the affected twin had markedly smaller caudate , amygdaloid , and hippocampal volumes , and smaller cerebellar vermis lobules VI and VII , in comparison with his brother .

9592105|Hyperthermic seizures-but not hyperthermia alone-resulted in numerous argyrophilic neurons in discrete regions of the limbic system ; within 24 hr of seizures , a significant proportion of neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala and in the hippocampal CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cell layer were affected .

9582260|In support of this interpretation , infusion of 3 M KCl directly into the contralateral PRh of rats kindled to a single stage 4-5 -LRB- generalized clonic -RRB- seizure from the ipsilateral amygdala reduced seizure manifestations from a generalized clonic seizure -LRB- stage 4-5 -RRB- to a unilateral clonic seizure -LRB- stage 3 -RRB- without affecting measures of focal excitability .

9586833|A comparison of wild Norway rats bred for aggressiveness against humans with those bred for the absence of affective aggressiveness showed a Bmax decrease without Kd change in the frontal cortex , hypothalamus , and amygdala of aggressive animals .

9539216|However , the basolateral amygdala lesions did not affect the neurodegenerative changes in the dentate gyrus .

9524800|These results indicate that possession , and thus expression , of the APOE epsilon 4 allele affects preferentially the inferior temporal lobe , encompassing the hippocampus and amygdala , in AD patients .

9522399|During sad mood , blood flow increased in the left amygdala and these changes correlated with shifts towards a negative affect .

9517826|A benzodiazepine -LRB- midazolam -RRB- , injected either systemically or directly into the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , differentially affected the acquisition of fear responses to a shocked context : Administration of the drug before conditioning impaired subsequent freezing to the context but spared analgesic responses in rats tested there for sensitivity to formalin pain .

9473612|Chronic RVM lesions also blocked TF inhibition produced by amygdala stimulation but did not affect heart rate .

9441730|We have previously reported that the dopaminergic projection from A10 ventral tegmental neurons to the central amygdala is , in part , responsible for the facilitatory effect of angiotensin II -LRB- AII -RRB- and its 3-7 fragment -LSB- AII -LRB- 3-7 -RRB- -RSB- on the retrieval of information in memory motivated affectively and also on recognition memory .

9412517|This difference was composed of significant signal increases in the amygdala to masked fearful faces as well as significant signal decreases to masked happy faces , consistent with the notion that the level of amygdala activation is affected differentially by the emotional valence of external stimuli .

9387861|The affected areas included layer 6 of cerebral cortex , layers 2-3 of retrosplenial cortex , dentate gyrus and the caudate whereas others were not affected by hypothyroidism , such as upper layers of cerebral cortex , the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus and the amygdala .

9370084|Consequently , DAT seems to affect the amygdala-hippocampal complex and their related function -LRB- i.e. memory -RRB- more than other cerebral structures , but cerebral degeneration in DAT is not restricted to these structures .

9331169|Colchicine affects cortical and amygdalar neurochemical changes differentially after middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats . .

9334416|CREB antisense in the amygdala had no effect on retrieval of CTA memory once it had been formed , and did not affect short-term CTA memory .

9295124|The results show that natural feeding is associated with an increase in DA turnover in the amygdala , and that peripheral glucose and insulin can affect DA metabolism in the amygdala presumably in response to changes in glucose utilization .

9361726|Agents that affect cAMP levels or protein kinase A activity modulate memory consolidation when injected into rat hippocampus but not amygdala . .

9251906|We have previously reported that the dopaminergic projection from A10 ventral tegmental neurons and A9 neurons of substantia nigra to the central amygdala -LRB- CA -RRB- is , in part , responsible for the facilitatory effect of angiotensin II -LRB- AII -RRB- and its 3-7 fragment -LSB- AII -LRB- 3-7 -RRB- -RSB- on the retrieval of information in memory that is motivated affectively .

9237754|Individual amygdaloid nuclei have been shown to project to various cortical and subcortical regions implicated in affective processing .

9237523|On the elevated plus-maze , central amygdala lesions did not affect behaviour under baseline conditions , but attenuated the anxiogenic effect of restraint stress .

9237523|Basolateral amygdala lesions , which did not affect conflict behaviour , also left ethanol intake unaffected .

9184662|Surprisingly , the same brain regions within the left hemisphere were significantly less affected even though no differences were observed between the left and right amygdala in the size of Congored-positive A beta deposits .

9105578|Furthermore , unilateral inactivation of either amygdala during CMIA training did not affect retention tested 48 h later .

9105578|Furthermore , these findings demonstrate opposite effects on 2 different measures of retention indicating that the method of testing retention affects the interpretation of the memory impairment induced by infusion of lidocaine into the amygdala .

9109396|Agonistic interactions did not affect TPH activity in the amygdala , nucleus accumbens or hippocampus in either winners or losers .

9141082|Unlike humans the canine entorhinal cortex , amygdala , basal ganglia and olfactory bulbs were rarely affected .

9134224|Fluspirilene also inhibited the intracellularly recorded e.p.s.p. in amygdala neurones without affecting the resting membrane potential or neuronal input resistance .

9075247|The present study examined the effects , in male Sprague-Dawley rats , or microinfusion of drugs affecting glucocorticoid receptors -LRB- GRs or Type II -RRB- administered into either the basolateral -LRB- BLA -RRB- or central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CEA -RRB- on memory for training in an inhibitory avoidance and water-maze escape task .

9051266|Neonatal androgen manipulation differentially affects the development of monoamine systems in rat cerebral cortex , amygdala and hypothalamus . .

9067466|This study investigated the role of amygdala CaM-kinase II -LRB- calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II -RRB- in affective learning and memory .

9067466|These results , taken together , indicated that the activation of amygdala CaM-kinase II in the amygdala is associated with the affective learning behavior , and may be one of the neural mechanisms underlying formation of affective memory .

9370199|In contrast , neither aromatase activity nor mRNA levels in the amygdala are affected by castration or hormone replacement .

9042571|In both tasks , neurochemically induced lesions of the basolateral but not of the central amygdala blocked the memory-modulatory effects of the intrahippocampal infusions of the drugs affecting glucocorticoid receptors .

9042571|Lesions of the central amygdala alone impaired inhibitory avoidance retention , but basolateral amygdala lesions alone did not affect acquisition or retention in either task .

8996817|Chronic morphine treatment induced a selective up-regulation of adenylate cyclase activity in the amygdala , without affecting other brain regions .

8942964|There is extensive evidence that the amygdala is involved in affectively influenced memory .

8942964|Additionally , infusion of beta-adrenergic blockers into the amygdala blocks the memory-modulating effects of epinephrine and glucocorticoids , as well as those of drugs affecting opiate and GABAergic systems .

9001703|However , the occurrence of the electrographical seizure in the high K + ACSF were not affected by amygdala-kindling operation .

8916192|Lesions of the amygdala do not affect the enhancement of the acoustic startle response by background noise . .

8916192|However , the enhancement by background noise of the ASR , which was observed in sham-operated controls , was not affected in amygdala-lesioned rats .

8905132|More generally , the findings suggest that the amygdala and its GABAergic system is involved in memory consolidation for both positive and negative affective experiences .

8921274|Previously we reported that LTP in the dentate gyrus was attenuated by lesion of the basolateral amygdala , but was not affected by lesion of the central amygdala .

8892335|A speculative model of affective illness cyclicity based on patterns of drug tolerance observed in amygdala-kindled seizures . .

8905660|Echo-Planar functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- EP-fMRI -RRB- was used to study the activity of the amygdala while three normal female subjects viewed alternating blocks of affectively neutral and affectively negative still pictures .

8905660|These findings are consistent with the large corpus of data from non-human studies suggesting that the amygdala is a key structure for extracting the affective significance from external stimuli .

8905660|This is the first known report of phasic amygdala activation detected with EP-fMRI in normal human subjects responding to affective stimuli .

8864488|Injection of CPP into the unilateral caudate-putamen , regardless of the site , did not cause any ictal change , or affect the stimulation of the amygdala .

8804674|Finally , on the visually cued four-baited path task , the two lesions did not affect any quantitative aspect of performance but a strong and unexpected effect of amygdaloid lesions on the patterns of arm choice was found .

8759044|Behavioral impairments in autism are theorized to result from abnormal neuronal organization in brain development generating 4 systemically related neurofunctional impairments : -LRB- a -RRB- canalesthesia , wherein abnormal hippocampal system function '' canalizes '' sensory records , disrupting integration of information ; -LRB- b -RRB- impaired assignment of the affective significance of stimuli , wherein abnormal amygdaloid system function disrupts affect association ; -LRB- c -RRB- asociality , wherein impaired oxytocin system function flattens social bonding and affiliativeness ; and -LRB- d -RRB- extended selective attention , wherein abnormal organization of temporal and parietal polysensory regions yields aberrant overprocessing of primary representations .

8738928|Gadolinium MRI of the head showed intense bilateral contrast enhancement affecting the medial aspects of the temporal lobes in the region of the amygdala and hippocampus .

8773763|In both mature and aged rats , intraseptal injection of 192-IgG-saporin selectively reduced ChAT activity in the hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex , without affecting ChAT activity of amygdala or parietal cortex .

8867047|When the release of arginine vasopressin induced by interferon-alpha , interleukin-2 , acetylcholine and norepinephrine was probed with inhibitors of guanylate cyclase , the interactions exhibited regional selectivity : neither the interleukin-2-induced arginine vasopressin release from hypothalamus , nor the norepinephrine-induced release of arginine vasopressin from either amygdala or hypothalamus was affected by guanylate cyclase inhibitors , but all other arginine vasopressin releasers were blocked .

8778875|In a previous study , lesions of the basolateral , corticomedial , and anterior groups of amygdaloid nuclei failed to affect food intake or body weight .

8725964|These various lines of research are progressively advancing our understanding of the amygdala 's role in providing linkages between affect and cognition .

8724978|Air puff stimuli that produced ultrasonic vocalizations induced Fos-LI to a more limited extent compared to the plus maze and avoidance test , with only the medial prefrontal cortex , medial nucleus of the amygdala , and lateral septum being significantly affected by air-puff .

8724978|Even though the sensory stimuli and environmental conditions associated with the three anxiety models were markedly different , specific common forebrain regions were affected , i.e. the medial prefrontal cortex , medial amygdala , and lateral septum .

8963438|A decrease in somatostatin-1 binding was observed with memory performance , independently of age , in the basolateral amygdala only , while somatostatin-2 binding sites were not affected .

8734484|Pilocarpine-induced seizures significantly elevated dopamine in the striatum , and in both dorsal and ventral aspects of the hippocampus , but did not affect dopamine in substantia nigra , nucleus accumbens , olfactory tubercle , cingulate cortex or amygdala .

8652073|Whereas lesions of the basolateral amygdala and ventral subiculum had qualitatively similar effects to reduce food neophobia -LRB- although not affecting the latency to eat -RRB- , amygdala lesions increased and the ventral subiculum decreased locomotor activity .

8652071|The present study asked whether partial amygdala kindling would affect the expression of conditioned fear-potentiated startle .

8646411|The limbic system -LRB- centromedial amygdala , anterior hippocampal rudiment , hypothalamus -RRB- is particularly well-represented , indicating a potential role for the 5-ht7 receptor in affective processes .

9033129|6-OHDA bilateral lesions to the central amygdala do not affect vasopressin improvement of recall in rats . .

8978987|The PVN neuron appears to be affected by multiple sources , including -LRB- 1 -RRB- brainstem aminergic/peptidergic afferents ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- blood-borne information ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- indirect input from limbic system-associated regions , including the prefrontal cortex , hippocampus , and amygdala ; and -LRB- 4 -RRB- local-circuit interactions with the preoptic-hypothalamic continuum .

8955562|This study investigated the roles of NMDA and AMPA receptors in the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex in formation and retrieval of affective memory .

8955562|These findings suggest that the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex may be contained in a circuitry responsible for formation of affective memory .

8955562|Further , retrieval of recent affective memory engages amygdala AMPA receptors , whereas retrieval of remote affective memory engages AMPA receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex .

8782523|Involvement of the spino-parabrachio - amygdaloid and - hypothalamic pathways in the autonomic and affective emotional aspects of pain . .

8740227|The results indicate that the amygdala is severely affected by the accumulation of both neurofibrillary tangles -LRB- NFTs -RRB- and LBs in most cases of the diseases mentioned above , and that amygdala LBs have a similar epitope composition to that of LBs in the brain stem and cerebral cortex .

8717364|Therefore , we examined whether seizures produced by electrical kindling of the amygdala or electroconvulsive seizures -LRB- ECS -RRB- would affect the expression of CCK mRNA in rat brain .

8869165|Given the crucial role of the amygdala in anxiety states , these findings suggest that DA cell function may also be affected in such disorders .

8636466|The amygdalar neurochemical changes are likely the result of damage to the insular cortex , although other cortical areas were also affected by the ischemia .

8564377|Thus , it appears that the amygdala , but not the hippocampus , plays a significant role in explicit data-based or working memory for affect information based on magnitude of reinforcement .

8711505|It was found that -LRB- - -RRB- SPD -LRB- 10 mg/kg , ip -RRB- did not significantly affect the DA contents in the striatum , olfactory bulb , N. accumbens , substantia nigra , ventral tegmentum area , N. amygdala , hypothalamus , pituitary , piriform cortex , but did markedly increase the DOPAC levels in these brain areas or nuclei , and thus increase the DA turnover -LRB- DOPAC/DA -RRB- .

7664672|None of the treatments affected CRH-R mRNA levels in the central and medial nucleus of the amygdala or the BNST .

7498304|Injections of SR 95531 into the central amygdaloid nucleus decreased ethanol responding significantly at doses of 2 and 4 ng without affecting water responding .

7477945|It is also suggested that the basolateral and central nuclei of the amygdala have critical roles in associative learning to relate sensory information to reinforcement or affective significance .

7576208|Unilateral infusions of lidocaine into the right or left amygdala did not affect acquisition .

24897512|Finally , via a role in processing the affective and reinforcing properties of the task , the amygdala appears to play a role in mnemonic processes .

7761446|Here we report that memory is affected by pre - or posttraining infusion of the PAF analog 1-O-hexadecyl-2-N-methylcarbamoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine -LRB- mc-PAF -RRB- into either rat dorsal hippocampus , amygdala , or entorhinal cortex .

7796168|Muscimol injected into the right or left amygdaloid complex differentially affects retention performance following aversively motivated training . .

7568627|Auditory processing , as assessed by event-related potentials , was affected most significantly in amygdala and dorsal hippocampus .

7780731|The amygdala in the brain plays a critical role in learning emotional components of experience , such as conditioned fear ; these processes in turn affect many other aspects of memory and cognition .

7597915|The binding of ZNC -LRB- C -RRB- PR to the sites was at a higher level in the brain regions -LRB- such as amygdala , cortex , -RRB- and was affected by Mg2 + .

7895011|The affect division includes areas 25 , 33 and rostral area 24 , and has extensive connections with the amygdala and periaqueductal grey , and parts of it project to autonomic brainstem motor nuclei .

7895001|The presence of impairments affecting the learning of new faces and the comprehension of gaze direction and facial expressions of emotion is consistent with the hypothesis of a role for the amygdala in learning and social behaviour .

7777222|On the other hand , the LTP in the lateral amygdala was not affected by APV , but was significantly reduced by scopolamine .

7676126|An MRI with both axial and coronal slices showed a right-sided infarct affecting the whole posterior limb of the internal capsule including the genu , the posterior part of the globus pallidus , the anterior third of the cerebral peduncle and the amygdala but sparing the thalamus and the corona radiata .

7675937|Neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis were less affected , but showed an increase in the duration of excitatory responses following medial amygdala stimulation .

7663881|In the central amygdaloid nucleus , beta-endorphin -LRB- 1000 ng -RRB- and muscimol -LRB- 20 ng -RRB- did not affect choice accuracy .

7610760|However , unlike Tay-Sachs disease in which neurons throughout the brain are affected , the localization of storage neurons in these mice appeared to be limited to certain regions , i.e. , cerebral cortex , the hippocampus , amygdala , hypothalamus , mammillary nucleus , etc. .

7704599|Selective lesioning of serotonergic neurons by intracerebral injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine caused a large decrease of -LSB- 3H -RSB- milnacipran binding in various regions -LRB- septum , caudate , hippocampus , thalamus , ventral and dorsal hypothalamus -RRB- , but in other structures , the -LSB- 3H -RSB- milnacipran binding was partially affected -LRB- putamen -RRB- or even unchanged -LRB- amygdala , lateral hypothalamus -RRB- .

7697359|In contrast , in all investigated brain areas , except cerebellum and pons/medulla , GFAP was increased from day 2 , reaching maximum levels at day 28 in most limbic structures and remained significantly elevated at the same high level -LRB- 15 fold increase -RRB- in amygdala , or somewhat lower levels in other affected regions -LRB- 2-7 fold -RRB- , but not in the thalamus .

7996189|Therefore , these findings suggest that the amygdala is another brain region in which glucose affects brain functions , possibly by interacting with the opioid system and/or other neurotransmitter systems .

7882008|The aim of the present study was to determine whether the 2-deoxyglucose uptake of amygdala slices was affected by olfactory bulbectomy .

7844251|This partial overlap suggests that some brainstem and hypothalamic nuclei preferentially affect different basal forebrain targets through the midline thalamus , and may allow , for example , information about stress to specifically influence accumbens shell and central amygdaloid nucleus .

7969945|For a specific subgroup of patients with migraine or affective illness who experience illness progression and drug tolerance , the amygdala kindling paradigm can be a useful , but nonhomologous , model .

7804830|Since lesions of the ipsilateral central amygdala and the contralateral basolateral amygdala did not affect the dentate gyrus LTP , the attenuation of the dentate gyrus LTP is a specific effect of acute lesions of the ipsilateral basolateral amygdala .

7804830|When the ipsilateral basolateral amygdala was destroyed after application of tetanus , it did not affect the established LTP .

8046462|The conditioned stress-induced increase in DA utilization in control animals was also detected in the lateral prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens , whereas DA utilization was not affected in the perirhinal or cingulate cortices , lateral-basolateral amygdaloid complex , anterior ventromedial caudatoputamen , or posterior dorsolateral caudatoputamen .

7986368|To determine if it affects mating through its connections with the ventral part of the lateral septal nucleus -LRB- LSv -RRB- , the caudal part of the medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- caudal BSTm -RRB- , or the medial amygdala-amygdalohippocampal area -LRB- MA-AHi -RRB- , these connections were severed .

7968717|This article reviews the considerable evidence which rejects the cholinergic hypothesis of Alzheimer 's disease -LRB- AD -RRB- and proposes that it is the AChE system of which the lightly stained neurons are located in the entorhinal cortex , the CA1/subiculum of the hippocampus and the amygdala which are the most vulnerable and are the earliest affected in the pathological processes of AD .

7778105|These data strongly suggest that lasting affective change is mediated by lasting changes in particular efferents of the amygdala of the right hemisphere .

7919196|Our results suggest that the amygdaloid region is a bottle-neck structure that confers an affective flavour to memories , thereby enhancing the probability of their long term storage .

8158266|These studies on the organization of GABAergic circuits in the primate amygdala are significant because alterations of function in the human amygdala have been implicated in the pathogenesis of temporal lobe epilepsy and in the etiology of affective and other behavioral disorders .

7913607|These findings suggest that amygdala NMDA receptors are normally activated by aversive training and play a critical role in memory formation for affective experience .

7531853|The levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine -LRB- 5HT -RRB- and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the parietal cortex , hippocampus , amygdala , nucleus accumbens and hypothalamus were markedly reduced in the lesioned group , but the levels of noradrenaline and dopamine were not significantly affected by the lesion .

8156971|Neither VPM nor NMD affected the ADT of the amygdala in adult or immature rats .

7911300|Pretraining intraentorhinal muscimol administration did not affect the amnestic effect of the post-training infusion of muscimol into the amygdala and hippocampus , or the inhibition of memory expression induced by a pretest infusion of CNQX into the amygdala and hippocampus or into the entorhinal cortex .

8133308|Moreover , 3 days after the ischemia , significant decreases of -LSB- 3H -RSB- QNB binding sites were observed in the ipsilateral thalamus and the amygdala , and also in the substantia nigra 1 week after the ischemia , areas which had not been directly affected by the original ischemic insult .

7953771|Recently , an explanation has been offered for this lack of correlation : different excitotoxins , when injected into the nbm , differentially affected cholinergic projections to the cortex and amygdala , and those excitotoxins previously reported to produce the greatest mnemonic deficits produced the largest decreases in amygdaloid ChAT .

7528965|The inclusions were round , well-demarcated , slightly eosinophilic and intensely argyrophilic bodies in the perikarya , and distributed mainly in the subiculum and Sommer 's sector of the hippocampus , amygdala and affected gyri .

7908804|Infusions of chlordiazepoxide into the amygdala , but none of the other structures , reduced thigmotaxia without affecting overall activity levels whereas infusions into the medial septum , but none of the other structures , prevented spatial learning , but not cue learning , and reduced swim speed in the water maze .

8136043|Numerous studies have reported that , in rats , memory can be affected by manipulations of the amygdala noradrenergic system .

7907881|These influences appear to be mediated by activation of NE receptors within the amygdala , as intra-amygdala injections of beta-adrenergic antagonists block the memory-modulating effects of hormones and drugs affecting these systems .

8136072|These results suggest that -LRB- a -RRB- the startle probe reflex is relatively uninfluenced by stimulus novelty , -LRB- b -RRB- the startle modulatory circuit -LRB- identified with amygdala-reticular connections in animals -RRB- varies systematically with affective valence , and -LRB- c -RRB- the modulatory influence is less subject to habituation than is the obligatory startle pathway or responses in other somatic and autonomic systems .

8248394|In a test of reference memory , neither CPP nor scopolamine affected the number of errors when injected into the basolateral amygdala at doses up to 56 ng/side or 5.6 micrograms/side , respectively .

8227531|Their laminar distribution in the spinal cord and the involvement of the amygdala and orbital cortex in limbic functions suggest that these pathways may play a role in neuronal circuits that enable somatosensory information , including pain , to affect autonomic , endocrine and behavioral functions .

8299274|The bilateral thalamic lesion seemed to affect the following structures , as judged from MRI : 1 -RRB- The anterior thalamic peduncle including most of the reciprocal connections between dorsomedial nucleus of thalamus -LRB- MD nucleus -RRB- and the frontal lobe , 2 -RRB- The inferior thalamic peduncle which serves as the reciprocal pathway between MD nucleus and medial temporal lobe , especially the amygdala -LRB- component of Yakovlev circuit -RRB- , and 3 -RRB- The inferior part of mammillothalamic tract -LRB- component of Papez circuit -RRB- .

8243438|Our results indicate that a granulomatous lesion in amygdala facilitates the generation and propagation of myoclonic seizures , whereas other components of PTZ-induced seizures are not affected .

8395181|Some amygdala neurons responded to the sight of objects in a graded manner that depended on the degree of affective significance of the object .

8395181|Responses in the amygdala depended on extent of the affect or value of the reward and responses in the lateral hypothalamus depended on positive reinforcement .

8395181|The results suggest that the amygdala contributes to stimulus -- affect associations and that the lateral hypothalamus is related directly to the initiation or termination of feeding through learning of stimulus-reinforcement association and/or maintenance of homeostasis .

8099792|In contrast , microinjection of NPY into the central nucleus of the amygdala did not increase food intake in free-feeding animals , did not affect unpunished lever pressing for food , but did reproduce the anticonflict/anxiolytic-like effect with high potency .

8099792|Thus , activation of Y1 receptors in the central nucleus of the amygdala produces effects similar to established anxiolytics without affecting food intake , suggesting that Y1-receptors in the amygdala may be a substrate for anxiolytic actions of NPY .

8488524|Anatomic analysis of the infarcted areas demonstrated that either insular cortex or amygdala was affected in all embolized rats .

8511169|In addition , by processing the affective attributes of the task , the amygdala appears to mediate mnemonic processes .

8451123|These results suggest that brief cerebral exposures to weak magnetic fields that simulate the burst-firing of amygdaloid cells may affect specific limbic emotions .

8450963|Responses to conditioned cue tones and those to rewards were also significantly related , suggesting that amygdaloid neuronal responses to conditioned stimuli are closely related to the affective nature of the corresponding unconditioned stimulation .

8447956|A neural system that includes the amygdala may mediate the rapid acquisition of behaviors based on biologically significant events with affective properties .

8446677|The present study was conducted to determine if the direct application of a small quantity of the benzodiazepine diazepam -LRB- DZP -RRB- to the amygdala would affect defensive freezing and hypoalgesia as measured by the formalin test .

24487116|Therefore it is suggested that the amygdala is likely to be a bottleneck structure for affect-related long-term memory functions .

23972121|The covert learning of affective valence does not require structures in hippocampal system or amygdala . .

8460535|In both groups the atrophy was maximal within frontal , anterior temporal and anterior parietal regions of cortex , although other structures such as the amygdala , caudate nucleus , thalamus and hippocampus were also affected .

8449177|Social conflict situations in rats differentially affect the development of amygdala kindling . .

8449177|Whereas repeated exposure to defeat in an agonistic setting did not affect the development of amygdala kindling , repeated victory experiences resulted in a significant retardation of the kindling process .

8442731|The medial amygdaloid lesion induced a deleterious effect on retrieval without really affecting the ability to relearn .

8328419|At 40 mg/kg i.d. both KY-2 and KY-R produced an increase in regional blood flow , as determined by the hydrogen gas clearance method , of the brain areas including the amygdaloid nucleus , but did not affect regional blood flow in liver , kidney and skeletal muscle , or renal artery blood flow .

8096163|Pilocarpine , however , did not affect the clozapine-induced increase in the number of stage-3 behaviors exhibited during amygdaloid kindling , suggesting that other neurochemical effects of clozapine , not related to its anticholinergic properties , modulate the kindling suppression .

7903924|These findings , taken together , suggest that NMDA receptors in the amygdala are normally involved in memory formation processing of affective experience .

7871013|The levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine -LRB- 5HT -RRB- and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the parietal cortex , hippocampus , amygdala , nucleus accumbens and hypothalamus were markedly reduced in the lesioned group , but the levels of noradrenaline and dopamine were not significantly affected by the lesion .

7870958|The levels of 5HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid -LRB- 5HIAA -RRB- in the parietal cortex , hippocampus , amygdala , nucleus accumbens and hypothalamus were greatly reduced in the lesioned group , but the levels of noradrenaline and dopamine were not significantly affected .

7862818|Destruction of the amygdala did not affect basal or cocaine-induced locomotion , suggesting that the amygdala does not mediate the unconditioned psychomotor stimulant effects of this drug .

7862818|These data demonstrate that cocaine-induced stimulus-reward conditioning can be differentially affected by lesions of the amygdala .

1477524|Since all of these activities have an affective component , it is likely that connections with the amygdala are critical for them .

21554639|The present findings suggest that Fos may function as a transcriptional regulator in the amygdaloid complex after stress and affect the synthesis of neurotransmitters and receptors in the amygdaloid neurons .

1456740|Despite a mean 35 % increase in cell packing density in the AD amygdala , total numbers of neurons and glia within tissue sections were reduced significantly ; medium and large neurons were preferentially affected .

1449643|Conversely , place learning proceeded normally in rats tested 24 h after kindling triggered by stimulation of the perforant path , septum , or amygdala , indicating that kindling per se does not affect place learning .

1393623|Epileptogenic activity in the amygdala is not affected by the amidine steroid , R 5135 . .

1354397|Furthermore , at 50 microM , a concentration sufficient to block both synaptic responses mediated by NMDA receptors and LTP induction in the hippocampus and neocortex , AP5 did not affect the probability of inducing LTP in the amygdala .

1616601|In contrast , the amygdala lesions only affected the ` massed ' condition and then only when the animals had to select the ` non-preferred ' stimulus .

1393529|Osmotic stimulation differentially affects cellular levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone and neurotensin/neuromedin N mRNAs in the lateral hypothalamic area and central nucleus of the amygdala . .

1326104|The present study investigates whether isolation-induced changes in social behavior can also be affected by this peptide via the amygdala .

1594684|The results show that amygdala kindling decreased exploratory and other motor activity in the open-field test , had anxiogenic effects on the elevated plus-maze , decreased boldness on the elevated bridges , but had a negligible affect in the spatial memory task .

1594684|These results suggest that amygdala kindling affects the normal fear reaction of rats , a response that is known to be mediated through the amygdaloid pathways .

1559605|Human and non-human primate research has shown that pathological processes affecting the temporal lobe , particularly the amygdala and hippocampus , are related to the development of the autistic syndrome .

1355858|Forebrain areas , such as the caudate-putamen complex , globus pallidus , prefrontal and frontoparietal cortices were consistently affected , whereas serotonergic fibers were only infrequently affected in other areas like septal and amygdaloid nuclei .

1734292|Three affected siblings and a cousin have come to autopsy , and all had neurofibrillary tangles without senile plaques in several regions of the neocortex , amygdala , and parahippocampal gyrus .

1600893|He differentiates '' visceral emotions '' -LRB- biologic side of the affect and lying in structures of the limbic system as the hippocampus and the amygdaloid complex -RRB- and '' feelings emotions '' -LRB- psychologic side of the affect -RRB- .

1377396|The levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine -LRB- 5HT -RRB- and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the parietal cortex , hippocampus , amygdala , nucleus accumbens and hypothalamus were markedly reduced in the lesioned group , but the levels of noradrenaline and dopamine were not significantly affected by the lesion .

1786555|The kindling-elicited sensitization of mesolimbic DA reward functioning seen after amphetamine challenge was discussed in relation to the role of the central amygdala in the integration of stimulus-reward associations , and in the conditioning of affective emotional states .

1759949|Daily intraperitoneal injections of glucose 100 mg/kg , 20 min prior to each amygdaloid stimulation did affect the rate of kindling development in comparison with the saline-injected group .

1764209|Conversely , in the low learner DBA/2 strain , hippocampal lesions have a negative effect on a single parameter of performance , while amygdaloid lesions only affect maze-running strategies .

1664272|An enkephalinergic mechanism involved in amygdaloid suppression of affective defence behavior elicited from the midbrain periaqueductal gray in the cat . .

1664272|Monopolar stimulating electrodes were also implanted into the central , lateral and medial amygdaloid nuclei from which suppression or facilitation of affective defense behavior could be obtained .

1766554|In contrast , lateral amygdala lesions potentiated the renin response to immobilization but did not affect the renin response to conditioned stress .

1652779|The regions affected included the periaqueductal gray matter -LRB- 73 % loss versus young adult rats -RRB- , the interpeduncular nucleus -LRB- 73 % loss -RRB- , the pontine nucleus -LRB- 63 % loss -RRB- , the superior colliculus -LRB- 46 % loss -RRB- , the ventral tegmental area -LRB- 46 % loss -RRB- , the temporal cortex -LRB- 39 % loss -RRB- , the frontal cortex -LRB- 34 % loss -RRB- , the hippocampus -LRB- 33 % loss -RRB- , the amygdala -LRB- 27 % loss -RRB- and the claustrum -LRB- 26 % loss -RRB- .

2043270|A previous study reported that power in the delta band of the amygdala is selectively elevated when primates are exposed to affectively ladened stimuli -LRB- Kling , Steklis , & Deutsch , 1979 -RRB- .

1669294|Partial or complete damage to the amygdaloid complex affected emotional behavior but not memory .

2047784|Recent neuropathological and neuroradiological studies of schizophrenia have pointed to the medial temporal cortex , especially the hippocampus , parahippocampal gyrus , and amygdala , as the areas primarily affected by this disease .

1827501|Because the width of the SSC measures separation of the temporal lobes at the level of the amygdala and entorhinal cortex , it is reasonable to expect this measure to distinguish between AD and HD , as the amygdala and entorhinal cortex are known to be particularly severely affected in AD , but not in HD , patients .

1707731|The present findings corroborate biochemical reports of a decrease in NT-IR in the AD amygdala and suggest that this peptide may be selectively affected relative to other neuropeptides .

1974919|The only other region where ECS was shown to significantly affect alpha-1 binding was the amygdala .

2366265|Time-course and dose-response studies of iron-induced peroxidation showed that the cerebellum and amygdala are the most susceptible regions with respect to concentration of iron and duration of the incubation time , whereas the midbrain and brainstem are the least affected areas .

1694325|They affect preferentially , but not exclusively , medial temporal lobe structures -LRB- parahippocampal gyrus , hippocampus and amygdala -RRB- , and can be found in all sub-types of schizophrenia .

2329367|AL is thus an essential link in the circuitry through which auditory stimuli are endowed with affective properties and may function as the sensory interface of the amygdala during emotional learning .

2156013|MK-801 increased dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- metabolism in the pyriform cortex , entorhinal cortex , prefrontal cortex , striatum , olfactory tubercle , amygdala , and septum without affecting DA metabolism in the cingulate cortex and nucleus accumbens .

2181332|Planimetric studies on post-mortem material and a recent MRI study show that medial temporal lobe structures -LRB- parahippocampal gyrus , hippocampus and amygdala -RRB- are preferentially affected .

2237779|The firing rate of the majority of amygdala neurons responsive to septal area stimulation was not affected by iontophoretically applied LHRH -LRB- 59 of 76 -RRB- or LHRH fragment -LRB- 41 of 65 -RRB- .

2141990|The 8-OH-DPAT injection into the median raphe primarily affected limbic forebrain areas -LRB- hippocampus , nucleus accumbens , ventro-medial neostriatum , amygdala and the septum -RRB- .

2133349|The amygdala is severely and consistently affected by pathology in Alzheimer 's disease .

1981091|The effects of drugs affecting these neuromodulatory systems are also blocked by injections of beta-adrenergic antagonists administered to the amygdaloid complex .

1981091|Thus , the findings suggest that the neuromodulatory systems affect memory storage through influences involving the activation of beta-adrenergic receptors within the amygdala .

2611662|Lesions of the medial amygdala decreased copulatory behavior , short day-induced weight loss , and anogenital chemoinvestigation but did not affect gonadal regression or other forms of chemoinvestigation .

2611656|Although morphine administration alone in general did not significantly affect ACh content and turnover in specific brain areas , morphine administered prior to TBI either prevented injury-induced changes in ACh turnover -LRB- dorsal pontine tegmentum -RRB- or actually reduced the rate constant for ACh utilization -LRB- kACh -RRB- and the turnover rate of ACh -LRB- TRACh -RRB- following injury -LRB- thalamus , amygdala , cingulate/frontal cortex , and hippocampus -RRB- .

2803563|Neurotoxic lesions of the amygdala did not affect the postoperative acquisition of a nonspatial test of object recognition -LRB- delayed nonmatching to sample -RRB- even when retention delays were increased from 0 s to 20 or 60 s , or when test stimuli were deliberately repeated within a session .

2803563|Comparisons with a previous study show that damage to the amygdala or hippocampus does not affect object recognition , whereas A + H damage produces clear deficits .

2552976|These results support the view that the GABAergic system is involved in the modulation of memory storage and that the amygdaloid complex may be a critical site for effects of drugs affecting the GABAergic system .

2548888|These data indicate that cholinergic basal forebrain neurons which project to the amygdala , as well as to the temporal , frontobasal , and frontodorsal cortices , are most affected in AD .

2550839|OT binding in the central amygdaloid nucleus was not affected by this treatment but higher binding levels were found in the most caudal sections irrespective of hormonal status or sex .

2571106|In conclusion , the somatostatinergic system is affected in amygdala-kindling ; but the relationship of anatomical localization and the magnitude of CYS-induced decrease of SLI to elevated seizure threshold needs to be studied further .

2542459|-LSB- 3H -RSB- Quinuclidinyl benzilate binding to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors was significantly decreased in the piriform cortex -LRB- by 33 % -RRB- , amygdala -LRB- by 39 % -RRB- , and nucleus basalis -LRB- by 33 % -RRB- in the group treated with kainic acid , whereas such binding in the hippocampus and frontal cortex was not affected by kainic acid .

2765165|Central but not basolateral amygdala mediates memory for positive affective experiences . .

2765165|Based on the assumption that in this task memory for magnitude of reinforcement is a function of the formation of reinforcement-spatial location associations resulting in the activation of affective experiences , it is concluded that the central but not basolateral amygdala is involved in the coding of positive affect information .

2752279|Post-training injections of BMI did not affect retention when injected into the caudate-putamen dorsal to the amygdala .

2540269|In the rat , -LRB- R -RRB- - alpha-methylhistamine -LRB- 3.2 mg/kg , i.p. -RRB- and thioperamide -LRB- 2 mg/kg , i.p. -RRB- also affected the pargyline-induced t-MH accumulation in eight brain regions and the effects were especially marked in the cerebral cortex and amygdala .

2713081|The lateral and central amygdala lesions differently affected the acquisition of a visual-stimulus/magnitude-of-reinforcement discrimination and did not impair its retention .

2929363|Our finding of the high proportion of BNST cells affected in their discharge frequency by ST stimulation together with the variability of the observed responses is an indication of the close amygdala-BNST relationship and also of the diverse functions in which both structures are involved .

2568896|Thus , it is suggested that a class of populations of TH-immunoreactive neurons are selectively affected in the amygdaloid complex in SDAT .

2733258|An acute administration of NSP at 50 mg/kg significantly elevated MHPG-SO4 levels in the amygdala and cerebral cortex ; and 100 mg/kg of the drug significantly increased the metabolite levels in the hypothalamus , amygdala , thalamus , midbrain , cerebral cortex and pons plus medulla oblongata without affecting NA levels .

2536332|Although ataxia may have affected the seizure stage , MK-801 attenuated the primary afterdischarge suggesting anticonvulsant effects in the fully amygdaloid-kindled rat .

2914216|Since naloxone -LRB- 0.1 microgram -RRB- did not affect retention when administered via cannulae implanted in either the caudate-putamen or cortex dorsal to the amygdala , the effects of intra-amygdala naloxone is not due to diffusion of the drug to these brain regions .

2682402|This choice was , however , attenuated by excitotoxic lesions of the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala , suggesting an interaction between this structure and DA-dependent processes of the ventral striatum in the processes by which reward-related stimuli come to affect action .

2682402|Other observations indicated that the amygdala lesion did not impair the discriminative property of the reward-related stimuli , or affect primary motivation .

2669845|Similar filaments also form the neurofibrillary tangles of affected perikarya , appearing initially within the large neurones of the entorhinal cortex , but later affecting neurones widely throughout the hippocampus , amygdala , cortex and subcortex .

2618748|In order to localize the sites in the brain where serotonergic -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- input may affect the performance of lordotic responses , the serotonin neurotoxin 5-7-dihydroxytryptamine was injected in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus -LRB- VMN -RRB- or in the medial amygdala -LRB- AM -RRB- in ovariectomized rats .

2536433|Subdivisions of the amygdala and hippocampus and discrete cortical regions were differentially affected .

2536433|In the amygdala , the basolateral nucleus exhibited reduced -LSB- 125I -RSB- pindolol binding after imipramine treatment but the central and medial nuclei were not affected .

3359223|Estrogen priming affects active membrane properties of medial amygdala neurons . .

3338535|Lateral amygdala stimulation gave rise to two types of cortical responses : -LRB- i -RRB- an excitatory response -LRB- 59 % -RRB- characterized either by a single spike discharge , or by a burst of two to four spikes , or -LRB- ii -RRB- an inhibitory response -LRB- 41 % -RRB- affecting cortical neurons which exhibited spontaneous discharge .

3281693|Conversely , ibotenic acid lesions of the amygdala did not affect the reaction to novel saccharin in a familiar environment but did impair both the reaction to novel food in a novel environment and passive avoidance learning .

3260194|We conclude the pathway from the amygdala through the preoptic region to the hypothalamus may not be the way in which amygdalar stimulation affects LH release in the cat .

2964546|In all three patient groups comparisons of incidence and severity over the three areas showed the amygdala to be the most commonly and most severely affected area by senile plaques , the hippocampus by neurofibrillary tangles , and the olfactory bulbs and tracts to be the least affected by both .

3688273|These results may be interpreted to indicate either that cell bodies responsible for changes in cardiovascular variables during electrical stimulation are not located in the amygdala or that chemical and electrical stimulation affect different neuronal elements in circuits located in the same anatomic site .

3120246|Our data are also consistent with a possible role for TRH in affective regulation in the hippocampus , amygdala , pyriform and other cortical regions .

3566694|AEPs recorded from BMA as well as other amygdala areas were not consistently affected by these IT cortical ablations .

2882437|In synaptosomes from the amygdala , both DON and NEM failed to affect the calcium-specific release of aminobutyric acid -LRB- GABA -RRB- , glycine or serotonin at concentrations which reduced release of glutamate by 50 % ; NEM , but not DON , elevated the release of dopamine .

3808176|Prenatal ethanol exposure alters rat brain morphology but does not affect amygdaloid kindling . .

3767832|However , since the IBO lesions did not affect the most medial parts of the amygdala complex including the central amygdala nucleus , the role of this nucleus in fear arousal has to be investigated further .

3697696|Specifically , seizures generated from the pyriform cortex and medial aspects of the amygdala -LRB- sites associated with prior facilitation of affective defense as determined by subseizure electrical stimulation -RRB- were followed by a reduction in threshold for this response .

3697696|In contrast , an elevation in affective defense thresholds occurred when seizures were generated from the central or lateral nuclei of the amygdala -LRB- sites associated with prior suppression of affective defense as determined by subseizure electrical stimulation -RRB- .

3697696|Preliminary data suggest that seizures generated from the pyriform cortex or amygdala can also modify quiet biting attack behavior , but in a manner opposite to that demonstrated for affective defense .

20493074|By means of radioimmunoassay measurements of regional neurotensin -LRB- NT -RRB- levels in the forebrain of the male rat it was shown that selective D2 DA receptor antagonists , such as haloperidol and sulpiride , and unselective D1 and D2 antagonists such as thioridazine , flupenthixol clozapine and fluperlapine , can acutely increase NT levels in the striatum and the nucleus accumbens without affecting NT levels in the amygdaloid or anteromedial frontal cortex .

3945655|The effects of psychological stress on brain NA turnover were affected by the animal 's shock history preferentially in the hypothalamus and amygdala .

2872691|Lesions in ventromedial hypothalamus or amygdala do not affect naloxone 's suppression of water consumption . .

4041859|Three flurothyl convulsions decreased the afterdischarge threshold of the amygdala and enhanced the rate of development of electrical kindling without affecting the intensity of postictal refractoriness .

4043018|Since endogenous adenosine can impede seizure spread and seizure continuation , but does not affect seizure initiation from the amygdala , perhaps endogenous adenosine has the special property of being brought into play as an anticonvulsant only by the seizure itself .

4027594|Biochemical assay showed that radiofrequency and ibotenic acid lesions produced a decrease of ChAT activity in the prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices and in amygdala without affecting the hippocampus or striatum .

3895578|Our data suggest that , although lead intoxication starting in neonatal life does not appear to affect the susceptibility to development of amygdaloid kindled seizures , it may enhance seizure severity in this model of epileptogenesis .

4039616|Previous studies suggested that the corticomedial amygdala is involved in agonistic behavior by affecting social learning processes .

3993453|It is postulated that in case vasopressin affects retrieval processes the site of action is located in the amygdala and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal complex with dopamine and serotonin as the respective neurotransmitter systems involved .

2412181|Both nomifensine and trazodone significantly affected the turnover of serotonin in the amygdaloid cortex following acute administration but no changes could be detected in the parameters after chronic drug treatment .

6541316|Both compounds suppressed the secondarily generalized convulsion but only affected the partial seizure from the amygdala to a limited extent .

6209591|These data indicate that both castration and administration of ETOH affects hypothalamic and amygdaloid content of SP , and also suggests that ETOH may diminish the release of SP .

6737042|It is worthy of investigation for its part in mediating CTAs in that it is sensitive to several physiological conditions which affect feeding while also being a site of anatomical convergence for vagal afferents from the viscera and centrifugal projections from areas -LRB- hypothalamus , amygdala -RRB- implicated in emotions and hedonics .
