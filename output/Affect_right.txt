25298173|A differential contribution of the right and left amygdalae to affective information processing has been proposed .

23228730|Kindling of the right basolateral amygdala profoundly affected spontaneous firing behavior and repetitive discharge characteristics of pyramidal neuronal electrophysiological properties .

19218865|Consistent with proposed specializations of the right and left amygdala in aversive conditioning , we hypothesize that right amygdala-rostral anterior cingulate cortex interactions mediate learning to avoid errors , whereas left error-related amygdala activation underpins detrimental negative affect .

17987064|We explored this hypothesis by mapping the functional coupling of right and left amygdalae in functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired from 19 patients with major depressive disorder and 19 healthy volunteers , each scanned twice -LRB- at baseline and 8 weeks later -RRB- during performance of an implicit facial affect processing task .

11568425|Differential contribution of right and left amygdala to affective information processing . .

9766770|Both the patients with schizophrenia and those with affective psychosis had significant left-less-than-right asymmetry of the posterior amygdala-hippocampal complex .

7576208|Unilateral infusions of lidocaine into the right or left amygdala did not affect acquisition .

7796168|Muscimol injected into the right or left amygdaloid complex differentially affects retention performance following aversively motivated training . .
