27109357|We found that in GG-homozygotes , but not in A-allele carriers , insecure childhood attachment is - in adulthood - associated with a -RRB- higher attachment-related anxiety and alexithymia , b -RRB- higher brain gray matter volume of left amygdala and lower volumes in right superior parietal lobule -LRB- SPL -RRB- , left temporal pole -LRB- TP -RRB- , and bilateral frontal regions , and c -RRB- higher mentalizing-related neural activity in bilateral TP and precunei , and right middle and superior frontal gyri .

27092060|Notably , a distinct population of GABAergic NI neurons expresses the highly-conserved neuropeptide , relaxin-3 , and relaxin-3 signaling has been implicated in the modulation of reward/motivation and anxiety - and depressive-like behaviors in rodents via actions within the extended amygdala .

27075857|In addition , mice in the L : DLD condition showed increased anxiety-like behaviors and reducedbrain-derived neurotropic factormessenger RNA expression in the hippocampus , amygdala , and medial prefrontal cortex , which are brain regions that are involved in emotional regulation .

27060334|CRF receptor type 1 -LRB- but not type 2 -RRB- located within the amygdala plays a role in the modulation of anxiety in mice exposed to the elevated plus maze . .

27053114|Genetic abrogation of IP3K-A altered amygdala gene expression , particularly in genes involved in key intracellular signaling pathways and genes mediating fear - and anxiety-related behaviors .

27053114|In agreement with the changes in amygdala gene expression profiles , IP3K-A knockout -LRB- KO -RRB- mice displayed more robust responses to aversive stimuli and spent less time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze , indicating high levels of innate fear and anxiety .

27053114|In addition to behavioral phenotypes , decreased excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic current and reduced c-Fos immunoreactivity in the CeA of IP3K-A KO mice suggest that IP3K-A has a profound influence on the basal activities of fear - and anxiety-mediating amygdala circuitry .

27052587|The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- is a key component of the extended amygdala , and has been implicated in anxiety and addiction .

27042185|Chronic pretreatment with Xiaoyaosan or antalarmin significantly reversed elevated anxiety-like behavior and the upregulated level of CRF1R and BDNF in the amygdala of stressed rats .

27026110|Moreover , exposure to stress elicits anxiety-like behavior and dendritic remodeling in the amygdala .

27013684|Panic Anxiety in Humans with Bilateral Amygdala Lesions : Pharmacological Induction via Cardiorespiratory Interoceptive Pathways . .

27013684|We previously demonstrated that carbon dioxide inhalation could induce panic anxiety in a group of rare lesion patients with focal bilateral amygdala damage .

27013684|To further elucidate the amygdala-independent mechanisms leading to aversive emotional experiences , we retested two of these patients -LRB- B.G. and A.M. -RRB- to examine whether triggering palpitations and dyspnea via stimulation of non-chemosensory interoceptive channels would be sufficient to elicit panic anxiety .

27013684|The induction of panic anxiety provides further evidence that the amygdala is not required for the conscious experience of fear induced via interoceptive sensory channels .

27013684|We found that monozygotic twins with focal bilateral amygdala lesions report panic anxiety in response to intravenous infusions of isoproterenol , a ?-adrenergic agonist similar to adrenaline .

27013684|These findings highlight that the amygdala is not strictly required for the experience of panic anxiety , and suggest that neural systems beyond the amygdala are also involved .

27011015|In the HIV + group , lower amygdala responses were associated with higher neuropsychiatric symptoms , particularly depression , anxiety , and alexithymia .

27000940|Moreover , abnormal activities of amygdala may be related to the anxiety observed in schizophrenia patients and at-risk adolescents .

26997280|Dynorphin Controls the Gain of an Amygdalar Anxiety Circuit . .

26982819|Genetic variants of FKBP5 may be associated with depressive and anxiety state via differential effects on amygdala and orbitofrontal region .

26965566|The activation and blockage of CRF type 2 receptors of the medial amygdala alter elevated T-maze inhibitory avoidance , an anxiety-related response . .

26965566|The present study investigates the role played by medial amygdala CRF type 2 receptors -LRB- CRFR2 -RRB- in the modulation of anxiety and panic-related responses .

26965566|These results suggest that CRFR2 in the medial amygdala , as CRFR1 , selectively modulate an anxiety-related response .

26952745|Astrocytes were responsible for CXCL12 induction upon LPS challenge in hippocampus and amygdala , and microinjection of CXCL12 into amygdala induced mice anxiety-like behaviors .

26952745|AMD3100 , which is an antagonist for CXCL12 receptor CXCR4 , prevented the anxiety behaviors induced by microinjection of CXCL12 into amygdala as well as injection i.p of LPS .

26948881|Imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- revealed that in anxiety only , activations during conditioning in the dACC and the putamen were correlated with later overgeneralization of loss and gain , respectively , whereas valence distinction in the amygdala and hippocampus during conditioning mediated the difference between loss and gain generalization .

26948881|Our results suggest that overgeneralization in anxiety has perceptual origins and involves affective modulation of stimulus representations in primary cortices and amygdala .

26941102|After including anxiety as a covariate , we discovered additional decreased functional connectivity with anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- for bilateral amygdala -LRB- P < 0.05 , AlphaSim corrected -RRB- .

26926605|Even neutral stimuli , when presented in an unpredictable fashion , prime anxiety-like behavior and elicit heightened amygdala activity .

26923505|Interactions Between Anandamide and Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Signaling Modulate Human Amygdala Function and Risk for Anxiety Disorders : An Imaging Genetics Strategy for Modeling Molecular Interactions . .

26923505|Here , we provide clinical translation for the importance of these molecular interactions using an imaging genetics strategy to examine whether interactions between genetic polymorphisms associated with differential anandamide -LRB- FAAH rs324420 -RRB- and CRHR1 -LRB- CRHR1 rs110402 -RRB- signaling modulate amygdala function and anxiety disorder diagnosis .

26923505|Analyses revealed that individuals with a genetic background predicting relatively high anandamide and CRHR1 signaling exhibited blunted basolateral amygdala habituation , which further mediated increased risk for anxiety disorders among these same individuals .

26923505|The convergence of preclinical and clinical data suggests that interactions between anandamide and CRHR1 represent a fundamental molecular mechanism regulating amygdala function and anxiety .

26865425|Current neural models of autism spectrum disorder -LRB- ASD -RRB- and anxiety disorders suggest hyperactivation of amygdala in anxiety , but hypoactivation of amygdala in ASD .

26865425|The objectives of this study were to -LRB- i -RRB- test the hypothesis that amygdala activity measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- represents a hybrid signal of opposing social functions and anxiety symptoms , and -LRB- ii -RRB- determine whether longstanding findings of decreased amygdala activation in ASD apply only to those individuals with ASD and low levels of anxiety .

26865425|Only individuals with ASD and low anxiety levels -LRB- a subsample of 28 participants -RRB- showed decreased amygdala activation relative to controls .

26865425|In the ASD group , anxiety symptoms were positively correlated with amygdala activity across the full ASD group , whereas core ASD symptoms -LRB- including social deficits -RRB- were negatively correlated .

26865425|Results indicate that hypoactivation of amygdala in ASD , a suggestive finding first reported nearly 20 years ago , can be masked by comorbid anxiety-thus bringing enhanced clarity to this line of work .

26859312|Lifespan anxiety is reflected in human amygdala cortical connectivity . .

26859312|The amygdala plays a pivotal role in processing anxiety and connects to large-scale brain networks .

26859312|However , intrinsic functional connectivity -LRB- iFC -RRB- between amygdala and these networks has rarely been examined in relation to anxiety , especially across the lifespan .

26859312|We employed resting-state functional MRI data from 280 healthy adults -LRB- 18-83 .5 yrs -RRB- to elucidate the relationship between anxiety and amygdala iFC with common cortical networks including the visual network , somatomotor network , dorsal attention network , ventral attention network , limbic network , frontoparietal network , and default network .

26859312|We detected negative correlation between global positive amygdala iFC and trait anxiety .

26859312|Network-specific associations between amygdala iFC and anxiety were also detectable .

26859312|Specifically , the higher iFC strength between the left amygdala and the limbic network predicted lower state anxiety .

26859312|For the trait anxiety , left amygdala anxiety-connectivity correlation was observed in both somatomotor and dorsal attention networks , whereas the right amygdala anxiety-connectivity correlation was primarily distributed in the frontoparietal and ventral attention networks .

26859312|Ventral attention network exhibited significant anxiety-gender interactions on its iFC with amygdala .

26859312|Together with findings from additional vertex-wise analysis , these data clearly indicated that both low-level sensory networks and high-level associative networks could contribute to detectable predictions of anxiety behaviors by their iFC profiles with the amygdala .

26853301|The ventral hippocampus -LRB- vHPC -RRB- , medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- , and basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- are each required for the expression of anxiety-like behavior .

26853120|The GTF2I rs13227433 AA genotype , previously associated with lower social anxiety , predicted decreased threat-related amygdala reactivity .

26853120|A common polymorphism in the WS gene GTF2I associated with reduced social anxiety predicts decreased threat-related amygdala reactivity , which mediates an association between genotype and increased warmth in women .

26853120|These results are consistent with reduced threat-related amygdala reactivity in WS and suggest that common variation in GTF2I contributes to broader variability in socioemotional brain function and behavior , with implications for understanding the neurogenetic bases of WS as well as social anxiety .

26845379|Expression of gp120 in mice evokes anxiety behavior : Co-occurrence with increased dendritic spines and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the amygdala . .

26845379|Our data support the hypothesis that HIV , through gp120 , may cause structural changes in the amygdala that lead to maladaptive responses to anxiety .

26845176|Interestingly , this correlated with changes in anxiety and fear-conditioned extinction , behaviors that have substantial amygdalar input .

26837851|The CBT groups , in particular , the therapist-guided arm , had a significantly greater decrease in avoidance , fear of phobic situations and anxiety symptoms and reduction in bilateral amygdala activation while the processing of agoraphobia-related pictures compared to the SSRI/SSNRI and WL groups .

26836417|Short environmental enrichment in adulthood reverses anxiety and basolateral amygdala hypertrophy induced by maternal separation . .

26836417|This is congruent with prior observations showing centrality of basolateral amygdala hypertrophy in anxiety induced by stress during adulthood .

26836417|In line with the ability of the adult enrichment to rescue stress-induced anxiety , we show that enrichment renormalized stress-induced structural expansion of the amygdala neurons .

26836415|Patients with anxiety disorders exhibit excessive neural reactivity in the amygdala , which can be normalized by effective treatment like cognitive behavior therapy -LRB- CBT -RRB- .

26836415|Before treatment , amygdala GM volume correlated positively with anticipatory speech anxiety -LRB- P -LRB- FWE -RRB- = 0.04 -RRB- , and CBT-induced reduction of amygdala GM volume -LRB- pre-post -RRB- correlated positively with reduced anticipatory anxiety after treatment -LRB- P -LRB- FWE -RRB- ? 0.05 -RRB- .

26836415|Further analysis indicated that diminished amygdala GM volume mediated the relationship between decreased neural responsivity and reduced social anxiety after treatment -LRB- P = 0.007 -RRB- .

26836415|Thus , our results suggest that improvement-related structural plasticity impacts neural responsiveness within the amygdala , which could be essential for achieving anxiety reduction with CBT .

26834594|The salience network -LRB- SN -RRB- consists of a series of key limbic and prefrontal regions that are engaged in the development of anxiety , such as the amygdala , anterior insula -LRB- AI -RRB- , and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- dACC -RRB- .

26834594|Here , we applied resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- to explore the relationship between intra - and inter-network functional connectivity -LRB- FC -RRB- of the SN and trait anxiety in adolescents using the amygdala , AI and dACC as the regions of interest -LRB- ROI -RRB- .

26833658|Classical experiments in mammalian models , mainly in primates and rodents , have shown that the amygdala is essential for appetitive and aversive associative processing and that dysfunction of this brain region leads to various psychiatric conditions , including depression , generalized anxiety disorder , panic disorder , phobias , autism , and posttraumatic stress disorder .

26821292|CaMKII? knockdown decreases anxiety in the open field and low serotonin-induced upregulation of GluA1 in the basolateral amygdala . .

26821292|Hyperactivation of the amygdala is implicated in anxiety and mood disorders , but the precise underlying mechanisms are unclear .

26821289|Exposure to both predator stress and EPM induced neuronal activation in the BNST , but not the central amygdala , and similar levels of neuronal activation were seen in both the high and low anxiety groups in the BNST after EPM exposure .

26819071|Previous studies suggest an effect of TS on amygdala volume as well as on amygdala-related behaviors such as anxiety .

26819071|Specifically , we tested whether amygdala enlargements in TS are localized to specific nuclei implicated in anxiety , such as the basomedial nucleus .

26819071|Group differences in global amygdala volumes were driven by local morphological increases in areas that are critically involved in face emotion processing and anxiety .

26819071|In the context of increased amygdala volumes in TS , our results also showed increased worry and social anxiety in young girls with TS compared with TD .

26802779|Initial analyses examined cortical thickness in regions of interest previously implicated in BI , anxiety disorders , and cognitive control : dorsal anterior cingulate -LRB- dACC -RRB- , anterior insula -LRB- aI -RRB- , and subgenual anterior cingulate -LRB- sgACC -RRB- ; and volumes of the amygdala and hippocampus .

26802567|Phospholipase D signaling , activated by dopaminergic , glutamatergic , and serotonergic signaling , can be a common downstream element recruited in associative memory mechanisms altered by cocaine , where increased expression in amygdala and decreased expression in dorsal hippocampus may result in altered anxiety states and increased locomotor responses , respectively .

26786379|The basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is critical to the pathophysiology of anxiety-driven alcohol drinking and relapse .

26786313|The direct role of miR-494 in the anxiety phenotype was also investigated via infusion of a miR-494 antagomir into the central nucleus of amygdala .

26779765|Within the basolateral amygdaloid complex -LRB- BLA -RRB- , Neuropeptide Y -LRB- NPY -RRB- buffers against protracted anxiety and fear .

26777900|Infusion of -LRB- S -RRB- -3,5 - Dihydroxyphenylglycine -LRB- DHPG -RRB- , a group I mGluR agonist , into the basolateral amygdala , a region involved in anxiety-responses , statistically increased the number of shocks in OVX , but not OVX+EB female rats at 0.1 , nor at 1.0 ?M .

26775553|Previous work demonstrates basal anxiety levels in outbred Long-Evans rats correlate with differences in voluntary ethanol consumption and that amygdalar Neuropeptide Y -LRB- NPY -RRB- systems may play a role in this relationship .

26775553|Rats were then tested for anxiety-like behavior in the light-dark box -LRB- LD box -RRB- following acute ethanol treatment -LRB- 1 g/kg ; intraperitoneally -LSB- i.p. -RSB- -RRB- , and neuronal activation in the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- was assessed using Fos immunohistochemistry .

26775553|Although NPY neurons were not significantly activated following ethanol exposure , in saline-treated animals lower levels of anxiety-like behavior in the LD box -LRB- more time in the light arena and more transitions -RRB- were correlated with higher NPY-positive cell density in the central amygdala .

26775553|Our results suggest that activation of the CeA and BNST are involved in the behavioral expression of ethanol-induced anxiolysis , and that differences in basal anxiety state may be correlated with NPY systems in the extended amygdala .

26769550|A network of amygdala connections predict individual differences in trait anxiety . .

26769550|In this study we demonstrate that the pattern of an amygdala-centric network contributes to individual differences in trait anxiety .

26769550|Individual differences in trait anxiety were predicted using maximum likelihood estimates of amygdala structural connectivity to multiple brain targets derived from diffusion-tensor imaging -LRB- DTI -RRB- and probabilistic tractography on 72 participants .

26769550|Higher trait anxiety was associated with stronger connections between the amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex , an area implicated in the generation of emotional reactions , and inferior temporal gyrus and paracentral lobule , areas associated with perceptual and sensory processing .

26769550|In contrast , higher trait anxiety was associated with weaker connections between amygdala and regions implicated in extinction learning such as medial orbitofrontal cortex , and memory encoding and environmental context recognition , including posterior cingulate cortex and parahippocampal gyrus .

26769550|Thus , trait anxiety is not only associated with reduced amygdala connectivity with prefrontal areas associated with emotion modulation , but also enhanced connectivity with sensory areas .

26767708|The inclusion of anxiety and depression as covariates did not alter amygdala resting-state functional connectivity differences between the study groups .

26758831|Basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is critical for fear learning , and its heightened activation is widely thought to underpin a variety of anxiety disorders .

26747511|Activation of protein kinase A in the amygdala modulates anxiety-like behaviors in social defeat exposed mice . .

26741286|We investigated OT administration effects on subjective anxiety and functional connectivity of basolateral -LRB- BLA -RRB- and centromedial -LRB- CeM -RRB- amygdala subregions with prefrontal and salience processing areas .

26741286|Although caution is warranted , our findings tentatively suggest that OT has the potential to diminish anxiety and fear expression of the amygdala in PTSD , either via increased control of the vmPFC over the CeM -LRB- males -RRB- or via decreased salience processing of the dACC and BLA -LRB- females -RRB- .

26740657|IS induces increased anxiety , which is dependent on activation of serotonergic -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- dorsal raphe nucleus -LRB- DRN -RRB- neurons that project to the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

26725834|Chemogenetic and Optogenetic Activation of G?s Signaling in the Basolateral Amygdala Induces Acute and Social Anxiety-Like States . .

26725834|Activation of noradrenergic circuitry in the basolateral amygdala is thought to have a role in stress , fear , and anxiety , and the specific cell and receptor types responsible is an active area of investigation .

26725834|We found that optogenetic induction of ?-adrenergic signaling in the basolateral amygdala is sufficient to induce acute and social anxiety-like behavior .

26725834|These findings support the conclusion that activation of G?s signaling in the basolateral amygdala has a role in anxiety .

26724568|We demonstrate that both GLP-1 and its long lasting analog , Exendin-4 , induce anxiety-like behavior in three rodent tests of this behavior : black and white box , elevated plus maze and open field test when acutely administered intraperitoneally , into the lateral ventricle , or directly into the DR. Acute central GLP-1 receptor stimulation also altered serotonin signaling in the amygdala .

26722018|vmPFC dysfunction may lead to disinhibition of amygdala causing high anxiety levels .

26711908|Neuronal overexpression of Glo1 or amygdalar microinjection of methylglyoxal is sufficient to regulate anxiety-like behavior in mice . .

26711908|Furthermore , since previous administration of MG had been systemic , we sought to determine if direct microinjection of MG into the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- was sufficient to reduce anxiety-like behavior .

26707595|Ethanol-dependent alterations in glutamatergic signaling within the lateral/basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- are critical for the development and expression of withdrawal-induced anxiety .

26682467|Alterations in Amygdala-Prefrontal Functional Connectivity Account for Excessive Worry and Autonomic Dysregulation in Generalized Anxiety Disorder . .

26678871|These findings suggest that the amygdala is responsive to the onset of cues signaling the unpredictable occurrence of a potential threat while the BNST in concert with other areas is involved in sustained anxiety .

26670947|During processing of fear and anger faces , greater amygdala and less right dorsolateral prefrontal -LRB- dlPFC -RRB- activation partially mediated the positive relationship between CEM and anxiety symptoms .

26666502|In this study , we investigated the relationship between abnormal amygdalar intrinsic connectivity , autism symptom severity , and anxiety and depressive symptoms .

26650182|Similarly , impulse control disorders in predisposed individuals , hallucinations , anxiety , and panic attacks may be related to amygdalar dysfunction .

26635724|Recurrent Hypoglycemia Increases Anxiety and Amygdala Norepinephrine Release During Subsequent Hypoglycemia . .

26635724|In addition to impaired memory , patients experiencing RH report alterations in cognitive processes that include mood and anxiety , suggesting that RH may also affect amygdala function .

26635724|We tested the impact of RH on amygdala function using an elevated plus-maze test of anxiety together with in vivo amygdala microdialysis for norepinephrine -LRB- NEp -RRB- , a widely used marker of basolateral amygdala cognitive processes .

26635724|However , animals tested when hypoglycemic who had previously experienced RH had elevated amygdala NEp during plus-maze testing , accompanied by increased anxiety -LRB- i.e. , less time spent in the open arms of the plus-maze -RRB- .

26626323|Withdrawal from long-term ethanol consumption results in overexcitation of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the amygdala , which induces an anxiety-like syndrome .

26626323|This study explores the changes in mGlu5 and PKC epsilon in the amygdala following acute administration of ethanol during ethanol withdrawal -LRB- EW -RRB- induced anxiety .

26626323|EW-induced anxiety was accompanied by a significant increase in mGlu5 , total PKC epsilon , and phosphorylated PKC epsilon protein levels , and also of mRNA of mGlu5 -LRB- GRM5 -RRB- in the amygdala .

26626323|Our results demonstrate that amygdala PKC epsilon may not be directly involved in the development of anxiety following EW .

26601506|-LSB- Influence of D1 , D2 Receptor Blockade in Basolateral Amygdala on Behavior of Rats with High or Low Levels of Anxiety and Fear -RSB- . .

26601506|The influence of bilateral D1 or D2 receptors antagonists infusions into the rat basolateral amygdala on anxiety , as well as the expression , extinction and re-learning of conditioned fear was studied .

26601506|There was discovered different sensitivity of animals with different levels of anxiety and fear to the infusion of dopamine receptors antagonists in the amygdala that suggested the inequality of dopaminergic transmission in the amygdala of animals with individual differences .

26595470|Furthermore , amygdala connectivity longitudinally predicted anxiety symptoms and emotion regulation skills at a later follow-up .

26586811|Sex , Impulsivity , and Anxiety : Interplay between Ventral Striatum and Amygdala Reactivity in Sexual Behaviors . .

26578781|The expression of serotonergic and GABAergic genes associated with emotional regulation in the amygdala was consistent with anxiety-like behavior in female , and partly in male PNA offspring .

26578781|To determine whether AR activation in amygdala affects anxiety-like behavior , female rats were given testosterone microinjections into amygdala , which resulted in anxiety-like behavior .

26578781|Together , these data describe the anxiety-like behavior in PNA offspring and adult females with androgen excess , an impact that seems to occur during fetal life , and is mediated via AR in amygdala , together with changes in ER? , serotonergic , and GABAergic genes in amygdala and hippocampus .

26578781|The anxiety-like behavior following testosterone microinjections into amygdala demonstrates a key role for AR activation in this brain area .

26564090|Patients with lipoid proteinosis therefore have been used as models for demonstrating physiologic and pathologic abnormalities of the amygdala with respect to fear processing , affect and cognition , anxiety and memory .

26557051|However , in lampreys and their putative forerunners , the hagfishes , the striatum , which is the input part of this EPS , probably corresponds to the human centromedial amygdala , which in higher vertebrates is part of a system mediating fear and anxiety .

26555428|Gene expression of NPS and brain-derived neurotrophic factor -LRB- BDNF -RRB- in the central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , as well as corticosterone secretion , increased concomitantly with the escalating anxious content of the mouse-specific anxiety continuum .

26546833|Dysfunction in amygdala-prefrontal plasticity and extinction-resistant avoidance : A model for anxiety disorder vulnerability . .

26546833|However , the link between anxiety vulnerability and amygdala-PFC dysfunction is currently unclear .

26546833|Accordingly , the present study sought to determine if innate dysfunction within the amygdala to PFC projection underlies the susceptibility to develop anxiety-like behavior , using an anxiety vulnerable rodent model .

26546833|Thus , dysfunction in amygdala-PFC plasticity is innate in anxiety vulnerable rats and may promote extinction-resistant avoidance by disrupting communication between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex .

26536109|Basomedial amygdala mediates top-down control of anxiety and fear . .

26525920|However , the amygdala may also play a role in comorbid anxiety , depression , and other psychiatric symptoms experienced in the interictal phase , especially in pharmacoresistant TLE .

26523857|Cocaine-conditioned place preference is predicted by previous anxiety-like behavior and is related to an increased number of neurons in the basolateral amygdala . .

26523857|In addition , increased numbers of neurons were found in the basolateral amygdala of the high CPP mice , a key brain center for anxiety and fear responses .

26523857|The results support the theory that anxiety is a relevant factor for cocaine vulnerability , and the basolateral amygdala is a potential neurobiological substrate where both anxiety and cocaine vulnerability could overlap .

26519902|The CRF system of the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- is important for the processing of anxiety , stress , and effects of acute and chronic ethanol .

26514583|Taken together , these findings reveal a novel , obligatory role for amygdala eCBs in the proextinction effects of a major pharmacotherapy for trauma - and stressor-related disorders and anxiety disorders .

26506054|After considering age at imaging , household income and postnatal maternal anxiety , regression analyses demonstrated significant indirect associations between maternal sensitivity and bilateral hippocampal volume at six months , with the majority of associations between sensitivity and the amygdala demonstrating similar indirect , but not significant results .

26481946|The aqueous extract of Albizia adianthifolia leaves attenuates 6-hydroxydopamine-induced anxiety , depression and oxidative stress in rat amygdala . .

26481946|This study was undertaken in order to identify the effects of aqueous extract of A. adianthifolia leaves on 6-hydroxydopamine-induced anxiety , depression and oxidative stress in the rat amygdala .

26481946|Our results suggest that the aqueous extract ameliorates 6-OHDA-induced anxiety and depression by attenuation of the oxidative stress in the rat amygdala .

26477647|Depression , anxiety , and posttraumatic stress disorder are linked to altered limbic morphology , dysregulated neuroendocrine function , and heightened amygdala responses to salient social cues .

26476009|Pharmacological depletion of serotonin in the basolateral amygdala complex reduces anxiety and disrupts fear conditioning . .

26476009|The basolateral and lateral amygdala nuclei complex -LRB- BLC -RRB- is implicated in a number of emotional responses including conditioned fear and social anxiety .

26472294|We also explored the correlations between the amygdalar volumes and social anxiety symptoms in the HR group with high social anxiety scores -LRB- HRHSA -RRB- due to the potential involvement of the amygdala in the pathophysiology of both BD and social anxiety .

26472294|These findings have implications for the link between amygdalar structure and both anxiety and mood control .

26441578|Altered medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- and amygdala function is associated with anxiety-related disorders .

26424431|Distinct amygdala FC abnormalities that explain depressive and anxiety symptom severity , and executive functioning were identified .

26416545|In contrast , anxiety was associated with elevated connectivity between the amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex .

26406106|Healthy men and women have distinct differences in amygdala responses , potentially setting the stage for the observed sex differences in the prevalence of fear , anxiety , and pain disorders .

26404844|In PTSD patients , greater anxiety prior to scanning and amygdala reactivity during the placebo session were associated with greater reduction of amygdala reactivity after OT administration .

26400259|It has been proposed that the central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , particularly its medial sector -LRB- CeM -RRB- , generates brief fear responses to discrete conditioned cues , whereas the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- promotes long-lasting , anxiety-like states in response to more diffuse contingencies .

26386304|The central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , part of the limbic system , plays an important role in learning , memory , anxiety and reinforcing mechanisms .

26385540|Trait anxiety , a personality dimension , has been characterized by functional consequences such as increased distractibility , attentional bias in favor of threat-related information and hyper-responsive amygdala .

26363852|Experimental evidence indicates that dynorphin neurons located in the nucleus accumbens and CRF neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BST -RRB- and the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- mediate anxiety-like behaviors immediately after the stressful experience -LRB- 24-48h -RRB- .

26354922|Crucially , children with greater tutoring-induced decreases in amygdala reactivity had larger reductions in math anxiety .

26354922|Our study demonstrates that sustained exposure to mathematical stimuli can reduce math anxiety and highlights the key role of the amygdala in this process .

26354922|Here , we demonstrate that intensive 8 week one-to-one cognitive tutoring not only reduces math anxiety but also remarkably remediates aberrant functional responses and connectivity in emotion-related circuits anchored in the amygdala .

26347689|Bilateral amygdala activation underlines the behavioral effect : Higher trait anxiety is correlated with stronger amygdala activation for negatively linked pseudowords than for neutrally linked ones .

26347412|Global and somatic anxiety were associated with the limbic and paralimbic structures -LRB- increased connectivity between the amygdala , PVN , and hippocampus -RRB- , while neuroticism was correlated with increased connectivity between limbic and prefrontal structures .

26334650|To date , no relationship between the structural properties of the human amygdala and attachment in romantic relationships -LRB- measured through self-reported attachment related anxiety and avoidance -RRB- has been described .

26334650|The aim of the current study was to investigate the relationship between amygdala structure as well as amygdala structural and functional connectivity and attachment anxiety and avoidance .

26322928|Here , using a combination of behavioral , physiological and optogenetic approaches in mouse , we identify a specific subpopulation of central amygdala neurons expressing protein kinase C ? -LRB- PKC? -RRB- as key elements of the neuronal circuitry controlling anxiety .

26322928|Our findings reveal that the neuronal circuits that mediate fear and anxiety overlap at the level of defined subpopulations of central amygdala neurons and demonstrate that persistent changes in the excitability of a single cell type can orchestrate complex behavioral changes .

26318631|Heightened anxiety in the F2 PNS males was associated with greater Crh mRNA expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala compared with controls .

26317601|It has been suggested that different brain regions are involved in the modulation and expression of anxiety , including the amygdala , hippocampus , and frontal cortex .

26299298|Connectivity between the right laterobasal amygdala and right hippocampus was positively correlated with levels of anxiety in BD but not in HC youth , and connectivity between the right laterobasal amygdala and right precuneus was negatively correlated with insight about bipolar illness .

26284742|Third trimester-equivalent ethanol exposure increases anxiety-like behavior and glutamatergic transmission in the basolateral amygdala . .

26284742|These findings suggest that high-dose ethanol exposure during the equivalent to the last trimester of human pregnancy can persistently increase excitatory synaptic inputs to principal neurons in the basolateral amygdala , leading to an increase in anxiety-like behaviors .

26275374|Neurokinin 1 receptor blockade in the medial amygdala attenuates alcohol drinking in rats with innate anxiety but not in Wistar rats . .

26247856|In this issue of Neuron , McCall et al. -LRB- 2015 -RRB- show that CRH projections from the central amygdala drive tonic locus coeruleus activity that evokes acute anxiety responses and place aversion .

26231445|Chronic systemic treatment with carbetocin -LRB- 1mg/kg , i.p. , once a day for 2-3 weeks -RRB- in PRS rats corrected the defect in glutamate release , anxiety - and depressive-like behavior , and abnormalities in social behavior , in the HPA response to stress , and in the expression of stress-related genes in the hippocampus and amygdala .

26223500|The impairment of CB1 R signaling in MAGL - / - mice was also accompanied by enhanced excitatory drive in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- - mPFC circuit , with subsequent elevation of glutamate release to the mPFC and anxiety-like and obsessive-compulsive behaviors , as assessed by the light/dark box and marble burying tests , respectively .

26223500|In this study , the authors provide evidence that congenitally enhanced endocannabinoid levels in the neuronal circuits underlying anxiety-like behavioral states -LRB- mainly medial prefrontal cortex , amygdala and hippocampus -RRB- lead to CB1R desenistization and anxiety and depression .

26220024|Stimulant use is associated with increased anxiety and a single administration of dexamphetamine increases amygdala activation to biologically salient stimuli in healthy individuals .

26214213|Oxytocin reduces amygdala activity , increases social interactions , and reduces anxiety-like behavior irrespective of NMDAR antagonism . .

26214213|This reduced social behavior may be due to glutamatergic dysfunction within the amygdala , leading to increased fear and social anxiety .

26214213|Decreased EEG power in the amygdala , as caused by oxytocin , may be related to both reduced anxiety and increased social behaviors .

26212712|Furthermore , endogenous corticotropin-releasing hormone -LRB- + -RRB- -LRB- CRH -LRB- + -RRB- -RRB- LC inputs from the amygdala increase tonic LC activity , inducing anxiety-like behaviors .

26204817|Bidirectional modulation of anxiety-related and social behaviors by amygdala projections to the medial prefrontal cortex . .

26204817|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- modulate anxiety and social behaviors .

26188287|We and others have suggested that this inflammation in the amygdala may cause disturbance of neural function observed as anxiety and autonomic distress in withdrawal .

26188147|Here , we used chronic intermittent ethanol vapor exposure -LRB- CIE -RRB- in male C57BL/6J mice to evaluate the effects of chronic alcohol exposure and withdrawal on anxiety-like behavior and basal synaptic function and neuronal excitability in prefrontal cortical and extended amygdala brain regions .

26134655|Our studies focused on the primary output neurons of the basolateral amygdala , a brain region that plays a key role in anxiety and addiction .

26115440|Whereas increased amygdala activity has been associated with phasic fear , sustained anxiety has been linked with activation of the bed nucleus of stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- , anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , and the insula .

26089770|Animals were tested for sociability , nociception , stereotypy , fear conditioning and anxiety , and for tissue content of glutamate signaling proteins in the primary somatosensory cortex , hippocampus and amygdala , and of corticosterone in plasma , amygdala and hippocampus .

26085626|Given the intimate relationship of stress and anxiety , we hypothesized that amygdala FKBP51 may mediate anxiety-related behaviors .

26032436|In adulthood , anxiety-like behavior returned to baseline and gene expression effects in the amygdala abated , whereas deficits emerged in novel object recognition for rats exposed to stress during gestation .

26032436|These findings suggest prenatal stress causes age-dependent deficits in anxiety-like behavior and amygdala function in female offspring , regardless of antidepressant exposure .

26011321|An influence of CNVs on gene expression in the central -LRB- CeA -RRB- and basolateral -LRB- BLA -RRB- amygdala , paraventricular nucleus -LRB- PVN -RRB- , and cingulate cortex -LRB- Cg -RRB- was shown by a two-proportion Z-test -LRB- p = 1.6 x 10-31 -RRB- , with a positive correlation in the CeA -LRB- p = 0.0062 -RRB- , PVN -LRB- p = 0.0046 -RRB- and Cg -LRB- p = 0.0114 -RRB- , indicating a contribution of CNVs to the genetic predisposition to trait anxiety in the specific context of HAB/LAB mice .

25999363|Across participants , more successful reappraisal correlated with less trait anxiety and more positive daily emotion , greater activation in medial and lateral prefrontal regions , and lesser resting-state functional connectivity between -LRB- a -RRB- right amygdala and both medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices , and -LRB- b -RRB- bilateral DLPFC and posterior visual cortices .

25986365|Whether the left amygdalar volume decrease constitutes a premorbid trait , a PD-associated neurobiological susceptibility to anxiety or arises as a consequence of chronic anxiety symptoms remains to be determined by future prospective longitudinal studies .

25986365|Nonetheless , we speculate that the Parkinson pathology is responsible for the reduction in amygdalar volume and the concomitant development of anxiety symptoms .

25981530|It is known that limbic structures , mainly the prefrontal cortex and amygdala , are involved in the processing of anxiety , and that projections from prefrontal cortex and amygdala can induce activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis with consequent cardiovascular changes , increase in oxygen consumption , and ROS production .

25981530|Chronic exposure to predator odor has an impact in the metabolic REDOX state in amygdala , prefrontal cortex , and hypothalamus , with oxidative stress being prevalent in amygdala as this is the principal structure responsible for the management of anxiety .

25888455|Here , we briefly review the role of CRF in anxiety , fear learning and extinction , focusing on recent cell-type and neurotransmitter-specific studies in the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- that may help to synthesize the available data on the role of CRF in fear and anxiety-related behaviors .

25887261|The amygdala has also been implicated in mood and anxiety disorders which display sex-specific features , most prominently observed during adolescence .

25870551|Seeing the world through non rose-colored glasses : anxiety and the amygdala response to blended expressions . .

25870551|These behavioral findings might reflect anxiety-related biases in stimulus representation within the human amygdala .

25870551|These findings suggest that anxiety-related biases in the processing of expressions intermediate between surprise and fear may be linked to differential representation of these stimuli in the amygdala and FFA .

25857821|Threat evaluation has been recently associated with the dendritic morphology of pyramidal cells in the orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- and basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- ; thus , we examined the rapid effects of restraint stress on anxiety-like behavior and dendritic morphology in the BLA and OFC of mice .

25851307|Two core components of the central extended amygdala , the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- Ce -RRB- and the lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BST -RRB- are highly similar regions that serve complimentary roles by integrating fear - and anxiety-relevant information .

25849981|ELS produced a decrease in GR mRNA in the brain , with a notable reduction in the amygdala that was associated with sustained alterations in anxiety , fear and sociability-like behaviors .

25833281|However , at both levels , only was the amygdala-insula RSFC correlated with anxiety .

25833281|Mediation analyses further revealed that the amygdala-insula RSFC mediated the association between 5-HTTLPR and anxiety .

25833281|In short , our study provided the first empirical evidence that the amygdala-insula RSFC served as the neural basis underlying the association between 5-HTTLPR and anxiety , suggesting a potential neurogenetic susceptibility mechanism for anxiety .

25814047|Potential role of adolescent alcohol exposure-induced amygdaloid histone modifications in anxiety and alcohol intake during adulthood . .

25814047|Adolescent rats displayed anxiety-like behaviors after 24 h , but not 1 h , of last AIE with a concomitant increase in nuclear and cytosolic amygdaloid HDAC activity and HDAC2 and HDAC4 levels leading to deficits in histone -LRB- H3-K9 -RRB- acetylation in the central -LRB- CeA -RRB- and medial -LRB- MeA -RRB- , but not in basolateral nucleus of amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

25814047|These novel results indicate that AIE induces long-lasting effects on histone modifications and deficits in synaptic events in the amygdala , which are associated with anxiety-like and alcohol drinking behaviors in adulthood .

25797491|Although the medial subdivision of the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeM -RRB- and serotonin-1A -LRB- 5-HT1A -RRB- receptors are involved in the regulation of anxiety , their roles in Parkinson 's disease -LRB- PD -RRB- - associated anxiety are still unknown .

25791846|Genome-wide expression profiling showed that cross-fostering bLR rats to bHR mothers shifted developmental gene expression in the amygdala -LRB- but not hippocampus -RRB- , reduced adult anxiety and enhanced social interaction .

25787948|Taken together , these findings provide new mechanistic insights into the effects of pharmacologically relevant neurosteroids in the amygdala and might be extrapolated to the regulation of anxiety .

25754825|Chronic stress induces anxiety via an amygdalar intracellular cascade that impairs endocannabinoid signaling . .

25754825|Collapse of endocannabinoid -LRB- eCB -RRB- signaling in the amygdala contributes to stress-induced anxiety , but the mechanisms of this effect remain unclear .

25754825|Mice lacking LMO4 , an endogenous inhibitor of the tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B , display reduced mGluR5 phosphorylation , eCB signaling , and profound anxiety that is reversed by genetic or pharmacological suppression of amygdalar PTP1B .

25754825|Chronically stressed mice exhibited elevated plasma corticosterone , decreased LMO4 palmitoylation , elevated PTP1B activity , reduced amygdalar eCB levels , and anxiety behaviors that were restored by PTP1B inhibition or by glucocorticoid receptor antagonism .

25754825|Collectively , these data reveal a stress-responsive corticosterone-LMO4-PTP1B-mGluR5 cascade that impairs amygdalar eCB signaling and contributes to the development of anxiety .

25754146|The aim of this study was to investigate the non-genomic pathway of testosterone and estradiol in the amygdala in relation to anxiety and depressive-like behavior .

25745592|In this regard , both structural and functional neuroimaging studies have demonstrated neuroanatomic and functional abnormalities within the amygdala and prefrontal cortex in youth with fear-based anxiety disorders , and have also suggested altered functional connectivity among components of the anterior limbic network -LRB- ALN -RRB- , as well as alterations in neurochemistry within the anterior cingulate cortex .

25740517|Corticotropin-releasing hormone drives anandamide hydrolysis in the amygdala to promote anxiety . .

25716780|The basolateral amygdala plays a critical role in the etiology of anxiety disorders and addiction .

25716197|Work that is more recent suggests that corticotropin releasing factor also plays an important role in mediating anxiety-like behaviors via the enhancement of central amygdala glutamatergic transmission , implying that ethanol/corticotropin releasing factor interactions may modulate excitatory neurotransmission in this brain region .

25716197|In addition , a number of studies utilizing optogenetic strategies or transgenic mouse lines have begun to examine specific central amygdala neurocircuit dynamics and neuronal subpopulations to better understand overall central amygdala neurocircuitry and the role of neuronal subtypes in mediating anxiety-like behaviors .

25673008|We aimed to investigate the disruptions of functional connectivity of amygdala-based networks in adolescents with untreated generalized anxiety disorder -LRB- GAD -RRB- .

25673008|The variation of amygdala-based functional connectivity and its correlation with anxiety severity were investigated .

25653526|The brain circuits in the amygdala are thought to comprise inhibitory networks of ?-aminobutyric acid-ergic -LRB- GABAergic -RRB- interneurons and this neurotransmitter thus plays a key role in the modulation of anxiety responses both in the normal and pathological state .

25650988|In the present study , we investigated , in adult male mice with C57BL/6 genetic background , the effects of a reduced phyto-oestrogens intake on anxiety-related behaviour and associated gene expression in the amygdala .

25650988|We hypothesised that this mildly increased anxiety may involve changes in the function of GABAergic local circuit neurones in the amygdala .

25650988|Our data suggest that expression regulation of interneurone-specific gene products in the amygdala may provide a mechanism for the control of anxiety-related behaviour through dietary phyto-oestrogens .

25625285|Preschool anxiety disorders predict different patterns of amygdala-prefrontal connectivity at school-age . .

25625285|In this prospective , longitudinal study of young children , we examined whether a history of preschool generalized anxiety , separation anxiety , and/or social phobia is associated with amygdala-prefrontal dysregulation at school-age .

25625285|As an exploratory analysis , we investigated whether distinct anxiety disorders differ in the patterns of this amygdala-prefrontal dysregulation .

25625285|Preschool generalized anxiety predicted less functional connectivity between the amygdala and dorsal prefrontal cortices in response to fearful faces .

25625285|Finally , a history of preschool separation anxiety predicted less school-age functional connectivity between the amygdala and the ventral prefrontal cortices to angry faces and greater school-age functional connectivity between the amygdala and dorsal prefrontal cortices to angry faces .

25610763|Recent neuroimaging work suggests that increased amygdala responses to emotional stimuli and dysfunction within regions mediating top down attentional control -LRB- dorsomedial frontal , lateral frontal and parietal cortices -RRB- may be associated with the emergence of anxiety disorders , including posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- .

25595987|The corticotropin-releasing factor -LRB- CRF -RRB- - producing neurons of the amygdala have been implicated in behavioral and physiological responses associated with fear , anxiety , stress , food intake and reward .

25586634|Blockade of the GLT-1 Transporter in the Central Nucleus of the Amygdala Induces both Anxiety and Depressive-Like Symptoms . .

25586634|We previously demonstrated that global and prefrontal cortical blockade of the astrocytic glutamate transporter -LRB- GLT-1 -RRB- induces anhedonia and c-Fos expression in areas that regulate anxiety , including the central amygdala -LRB- CEA -RRB- .

25586634|Given the role of the amygdala in anxiety and the high degree of comorbidity between anxiety and depression , we hypothesized that GLT-1 blockade in the CEA would induce symptoms of anhedonia and anxiety in rats .

25583614|Understanding how individual differences in these factors predict differences in emotional responsivity may be important for understanding both normative emotional development and for understanding the mechanisms underlying internalizing disorders , like anxiety and depression , that have often been related to increased amygdala and hippocampus responses to negatively valenced emotional stimuli .

25581710|Early-life stress induces anxiety-like behaviors and activity imbalances in the medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala in adult rats . .

25581710|Emotional regulation requires the inhibitory influence of the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- on amygdalar activity , and dysfunction of this system is believed to induce anxiety .

25581710|We examined the effects of stress during circuit development on anxiety-like behaviors , neural activities in the mPFC and amygdala , and impulse transmission in the mPFC-amygdala circuit in adult rats .

25581710|These data suggest that early-life stress impairs the mPFC-amygdala circuit development , resulting in imbalanced mPFC and amygdala activities and anxiety-like behaviors .

25580566|Relative to controls , larger left amygdala volumes were found in the Epilepsy with Anxiety group compared to the Epilepsy without Anxiety group -LRB- p = 0.027 -RRB- .

25580566|Anxiety is a common psychiatric comorbidity in children with recent-onset epilepsy with volumetric enlargement of the amygdala and thinner cortex in orbital and other regions of prefrontal cortex , suggesting structural abnormalities in brain regions that are part of the dysfunctional networks reported in individuals with anxiety disorders in the general population .

25502633|Fear of the unknown : uncertain anticipation reveals amygdala alterations in childhood anxiety disorders . .

25502633|Extensive studies in non-human animals implicate amygdala dysfunction as a critical substrate for early life anxiety .

25502633|Our findings suggest that increased amygdala activation may have an important role in the generation of uncertainty-related anxiety .

25500120|Other variables were depression , memory loss , and MRI-derived AD-related regions of interest -LRB- ROIs -RRB- , including hippocampal , amygdalar , entorhinal cortical -LRB- EC -RRB- volumes , and EC thickness , In addition , a linear regression model was used to determine the effect of anxiety in aMCI on rates of atrophy within ROIs .

25486982|This leads to sustained anxiety and activations of the amygdala , CRH/HPA axis , the sympathomedullary system and their sequella , including early morning awakening and loss of appetite .

25486578|On postnatal days -LRB- PND -RRB- 12 and 22 , we determined in experimental and control dams levels of anxiety in the elevated plus maze -LRB- EPM -RRB- as well as the levels of receptors for estrogens -LRB- ER? , ER? -RRB- , oxytocin -LRB- OTR -RRB- and serotonin -LRB- 5-HT1AR -RRB- in areas of the limbic system -LRB- prefrontal cortex-PFC , hippocampus , lateral septum-SL , medial preoptic area-MPOA , shell of nucleus accumbens-nAc-Sh , central-CeA and basolateral-BLA amygdala -RRB- , involved in the regulation of maternal behavior .

25479021|Our experiments led to the following key findings : 1 -RRB- the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- sgACC -RRB- is the only activation site that relates to uncertainty in healthy volunteers and is directly correlated to individual questionnaire score for pain-related anxiety ; 2 -RRB- uncertain anticipation of rectal distension involved several relevant brain regions , namely activation of sgACC and medial prefrontal cortex and deactivation of amygdala , insula , thalamus , secondary somatosensory cortex , supplementary motor area and cerebellum ; 3 -RRB- most of the brain activity during anticipation , but not distension , is associated with activity of the central autonomic network .

25458113|Activation of 5-HT2a receptors in the basolateral amygdala promotes defeat-induced anxiety and the acquisition of conditioned defeat in Syrian hamsters . .

25458113|Because neural activity in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is critical for the acquisition of conditioned defeat and BLA 5-HT2a receptors can modulate anxiety but have a limited effect on emotional memories , we investigated whether 5-HT2a receptor modulation alters defeat-induced anxiety but not defeat-related memories .

25451388|Elevated amygdala activity during reappraisal anticipation predicts anxiety in avoidant personality disorder . .

25451388|In addition , relative to healthy participants , avoidant patients showed pronounced amygdala hyper-reactivity during reappraisal anticipation , and this hyper-reactivity effect was positively associated with increasing self-reported anxiety levels .

25451388|Our finding of exaggerated amygdala activity during reappraisal anticipation could reflect anxiety about the impending need to reappraise , anxiety about the certainty of an upcoming negative image , or anxiety relating to anticipated scrutiny of task responses by the experimenters .

25451388|These results suggest that amygdala reactivity in anticipation of receiving negative social information may represent a key component of the neural mechanisms underlying the heightened anxiety present in avoidant patients .

25450525|Since neonatal handling has persistent effects on stress and anxiety responses , we hypothesized that its involvement in the aforementioned association may be associated with differential neuroadaptations in the amygdala during withdrawal periods .

25422963|The majority of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have examined mean group differences in amygdala activation or connectivity in children and adolescents with anxiety disorders relative to controls , but emerging evidence suggests that abnormalities in amygdala function are dependent on the timing of the task and may vary across the course of a scanning session .

25396729|The findings clearly support the view of a hypersensitive threat-detection system , combined with disorder-related alterations in amygdala-prefrontal cortex connectivity in pathological anxiety .

25365801|Furthermore , connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampus was positively related to measures of depression , trait anxiety , and emotion dysregulation , and negatively related to self-compassion and dispositional mindfulness .

25326039|Trait attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance were positively correlated with amygdala activation to threatening faces in the control group , but not in the attachment primed group .

25308353|The amygdala is important for manifestation and modulation of anxiety .

25308353|However , relatively little is known regarding the mechanisms that control the amygdala inhibitory activity that is involved in anxiety .

25308353|Together , these observations indicated that NRG1-ErbB4 signaling is critical to maintaining GABAergic activity in the amygdala and thus to modulating anxiety-like behaviors .

25307567|Data from animal models that support this thesis show that acute withdrawal from chronic alcohol , sufficient to produce dependence , increases reward thresholds , increases anxiety-like responses , decreases dopamine system function , and increases extracellular levels of CRF in the central nucleus of the amygdala .

25288139|Prolonged exposure of the central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- to elevated corticosteroids -LRB- CORT -RRB- facilitates long-term anxiety and pain through activation of glucocorticoid receptors -LRB- GRs -RRB- and corticotropin-releasing factor -LRB- CRF -RRB- .

25288139|Our results indicate that epigenetic programming in the amygdala , specifically histone modifications , is important in the maintenance of chronic anxiety and pain .

25287533|Fear of novelty and anxiety are associated with enlargement of the amygdala and its corticotropin-releasing factor content , and decreased socialization , with lower oxytocin activity in the amygdala .

25281921|We investigated whether basal dopamine release occurs in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , where sensory-related inputs are received and lead to fear or anxiety responses , and whether D1 - and D2-like receptor antagonists affect breathing patterns and dopamine release in the BLA .

25278852|Recently , however , a separate pathway has been proposed for interoceptive panic and anxiety signals , as patients exhibited CO2-inhalation induced panic responses despite bilateral lesions of the amygdala .

25278852|This lends support to recent clinical observations and highlights the importance of looking beyond the traditional focus on limbic structures , such as the hippocampus and amygdala , to investigate a role for cortical areas in panic and anxiety in humans .

25278838|The central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- has a role for mediating fear and anxiety responses .

25204221|In the present study , we examined whether the protection against nerve agent-induced seizures and neuropathology conferred by LY293558 translates into protection against pathophysiological alterations in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and the development of anxiety , which is the most prevalent behavioral deficit resulting from exposure .

25202244|The effectiveness of this procedure in reducing fear expression was assessed in terms of behavioral outcomes related to PTSD -LRB- e.g. , hyper-reactivity to a neutral tone , anxiety levels in a plus maze task , social avoidance , and learning deficits in a spatial water maze -RRB- and of amygdala activity by evaluating c-fos expression .

25076878|In particular , we focus on recent evidence that projections from the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- to the ventral hippocampus -LRB- vHPC -RRB- modulate anxiety-related behaviors and also alter social interaction .

25064495|These findings support the amygdalar AMPAergic protective response against anxiety states in chronically stressed hamsters , which may constitute useful therapeutic strategies for panic-related mood disorders .

25059093|In the plus-maze , scores of GAERS and Wistars were similar , but NECs appeared significantly less anxious -LRB- possibly in association with increased amygdala volume -RRB- ; evidence for weaker anxiety in NECs was also found in the open-field evaluation .

24796255|Preclinical studies demonstrate that mouse strains vary greatly in anxiety-related responses to chronic stress in a manner paralleled by differential stress-induced changes in glutamatergic signaling in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

24796255|Previous work has also shown that alterations in the amygdala gene expression of the GluN1 NMDA and the GluK1 kainate receptors are associated with stress-induced alterations in anxiety-like behavior in the C57BL/6J mouse strain .

24791714|We found that adolescent animals perinatally exposed to HFD generally showed decreased anxiety behavior accompanied by a selective alteration in the expression of the glucocorticoid receptor and several downstream inflammatory genes in the hippocampus and amygdala .

24778610|This proposal thus brings forward a sensory cortical pathway to threat processing -LRB- in addition to amygdala-based processes -RRB- , potentially accounting for an alternative mechanism underlying the pathophysiology of anxiety and depression .

24768696|We found a down-regulation of cytochrome c oxidase in the nucleus basalis , in movement-related structures such as the primary motor cortex and the globus pallidus , memory-related structures such as the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex and in anxiety-related structures like the amygdala , which also plays a role in memory .

24760033|In healthy females , left and right amygdalae seem implicated in distinct mPFC brain networks related to HA and may represent a vulnerability marker for sensitivity to stress and anxiety -LRB- disorders -RRB- .

24758222|Chronic stress is generally known to exacerbate the development of numerous neuropsychiatric diseases such as fear and anxiety disorders , which is at least partially due to the disinhibition of amygdala subsequent to the prolonged stress exposure .

24755617|Increased amygdala and visual cortex activity and functional connectivity towards stimulus novelty is associated with state anxiety . .

24755617|Thus , we suggest that amygdala is involved in fast sensory boosting that may be important for attention reallocation to novel events , and that the strength of this response depends on individual state anxiety .

24753242|Analyses examined moderation by anxiety/depression of condition-dependent coupling between regions of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- dlPFC -RRB- previously associated with approach and avoidance motivation and amygdala/orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- .

24753211|To identify neural signatures of risk , we tested for group differences in functional activation and connectivity in regions implicated in social anxiety disorder , including the prefrontal cortex , amygdala , and insula .

24753211|Within the inhibited group , those with fewer social anxiety symptoms and better emotion regulation skills had greater ACC activation and greater functional connectivity between the ACC and amygdala .

24752071|Separation anxiety is associated with increased amygdala responsiveness and volume . .

24752071|Therefore , we investigated functional -LRB- amygdala responsiveness and functional connectivity during threat-related emotion processing -RRB- and structural -LRB- grey matter volume -RRB- imaging markers associated with separation anxiety as measured with the Relationship Scale Questionnaire in a large sample of healthy adults from the Mnster Neuroimaging Cohort -LRB- N = 320 -RRB- .

24752071|The main results were positive associations of separation anxiety scores with amygdala reactivity to emotional faces as well as increased amygdala grey matter volumes .

24752071|A functional connectivity analysis revealed positive associations between separation anxiety and functional coupling of the amygdala with areas involved in visual processes and attention , including several occipital and somatosensory areas .

24751570|For the controls , OFC and amygdala activity were positively correlated with self-reported dental anxiety during attention to pain .

24744710|We briefly review studies demonstrating the central role that the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminals -LRB- BNST -RRB- play in modulating anxiety and present evidence showing how the bed nucleus uses different output pathways to influence specific features of anxiolysis .

24744710|Lastly , we propose that several brain regions , such as the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- and the ventral hippocampus -LRB- vHPC -RRB- , act in a coordinated fashion with the amygdala and BNST , forming a distributed network of interconnected structures that control anxiety both in rodents and humans .

24742621|Calcineurin downregulation in the amygdala is sufficient to induce anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors in C57BL/6J male mice . .

24742621|The calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin is highly expressed in the amygdala , a brain area important for behaviors related to mood disorders and anxiety .

24742621|Pharmacological -LRB- CSA -RRB- and viral-mediated gene transfer -LRB- adeno-associated viral expression of short hairpin RNA -LSB- shRNA -RSB- -RRB- approaches were used to inhibit calcineurin activity systemically or selectively in the amygdala of the mouse brain to determine the role of calcineurin in behaviors related to anxiety and depression .

24742621|Systemic inhibition of calcineurin activity with CsA or local downregulation of calcineurin levels in the amygdala using adeno-associated viral-delivered shRNAs targeting calcineurin B increased measures of anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze , the light/dark box , and the open field test .

24742621|Taken together , these data demonstrate that decreasing calcineurin activity in the amygdala increases anxiety-like behaviors and to some extent depression-like behaviors .

24736324|Abnormal amygdala functioning has also been detected following stress exposure and is also implicated in anxiety and social disorders .

24736324|We found reduced GAD and GABA-A ?3 , but not ?2 , subunit protein levels throughout all the amygdala nuclei examined -LRB- lateral , basolateral , basomedial , medial and central -RRB- and increased anxiety-like behaviors and reduced sociability in peripubertally stressed animals .

24732637|The aim of the present work was to study the acute effects of 17?-estradiol on anxiety-like behaviour and on CCK-like immunoreactivity -LRB- LI -RRB- in the female rat brain -LRB- amygdala , hippocampus , nucleus accumbens , and cingulate cortex -RRB- .

24732411|Changes in histone acetylation and histone-modifying enzymes were examined in hippocampus , amygdala and frontal cortex which are considered critical for anxiety , depression and cognition .

24728652|Developmental alterations of the serotonergic system caused by genetic inactivation of SERT can have different influences on anxiety-like and cognitive behaviors through early adolescence into adulthood , which may be associated with changes of spine density in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala .

24727401|Indeed , it permitted to depict precisely the role of specific cell populations in various brain areas , including the amygdala nuclei , the auditory cortex , the anterior cingulate , the hypothalamus , the hippocampus and the bed nucleus of stria terminalis in specific aspects of fear and anxiety behaviors .

24726709|We hypothesized that pharmacological activation of 5-HT1A receptors prior to social defeat would reduce avoidance of familiar opponents and impair Arc expression in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , but not alter anxiety-like behavior .

24723867|For example , studies using optogenetics have examined how specific circuits within amygdala nuclei regulate anxiety .

24723854|Modulation of their activity is thus thought to affect amygdala output and the generation of fear and anxiety .

24719001|These are : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the deactivation of the default mode network that generates spontaneous thoughts , contributes to the maintenance of the autobiographical self and is associated with anxiety and depression ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the anterior cingulate cortex that underpins attention functions ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- the anterior insula associated with the perception of visceral sensation , the detection of heartbeat and respiratory rate , and the affective response to pain ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- the posterior cingulate cortex which helps to understand the context from which a stimulus emerges ; -LRB- 5 -RRB- the temporoparietal junction which assumes a central role in empathy and compassion ; -LRB- 6 -RRB- the amygdala implicated in fear responses .

24713371|Overall , these findings suggest that environmental enrichment offers benefits for trait anxiety rats including a reduction in behavioral and physiological responses to anxiogenic stimuli and AMPH sensitivity , and these responses correlate with changes in BDNF expression in the central amygdala , hippocampus and the caudate putamen .

24710789|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- participates in anxiety-like behaviors including those induced by alcohol withdrawal .

24709069|For the anticipatory anxiety , the reviewed evidence points to corticolimbic structures , such as the amygdala , the septo-hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex , as its main neural substrate , modulated by stimulation of 5-HT2C and 5-HT1A receptors .

24708929|Effects of substance P and Sar-Met-SP , a NK1 agonist , in distinct amygdaloid nuclei on anxiety-like behavior in rats . .

24708929|The amygdala , together with the dorsal periaqueductal gray -LRB- dPAG -RRB- , medial hypothalamus , and deep layers of the superior and inferior colliculi , constitutes the encephalic aversion system , which has been considered the main neural substrate for the organization of fear and anxiety .

24708929|Although some findings point to the distinct participation of the substance P -LRB- SP -RRB- and the NK1 receptors system in the different nuclei of the amygdala on the expression of emotional behaviors , it is not clear if this system modulates anxiety-like responses in the distinct nuclei of the amygdala as well as the dPAG .

24707138|The involvement of structures the limbic system , such as the anterior cingulate cortex , the prefrontal cortex , and the amygdala , paves the way for the discovery of the mechanisms underlying depression depression , anxiety , alexithymia , personality traits , and other psychological impairments following the onset of IBD .

24694839|Phosphodiesterase 2 -LRB- PDE2 -RRB- is linked to cGMP-PKG signaling and highly expressed in the limbic brain regions including hippocampus and amygdala , which may play important roles in the treatment of depression and anxiety .

24688456|The amygdaloid complex is a key brain structure involved in the expression of behaviors and emotions such as learning , fear , and anxiety .

24681006|Cumulating evidence suggests that action monitoring is modulated by trait anxiety and negative affect , and that activity of the dMFC and the amygdala during action monitoring might contribute to the ` affective tagging ' of actions along a valence dimension .

24678582|Our findings suggest that impaired glucocorticod signalling in hippocampus and amygdala of AS mice is critical for the decrease in parvalbumin interneurons number , emergence of anxiety and other behavioural deficits and highlights the importance of fluoxetine in the recovery of these abnormalities .

24674772|The role of neuropeptide Y -LRB- NPY -RRB- in the central nucleus of amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- in the preventive effects of acupuncture against ethanol withdrawal-induced anxiety was investigated .

24666527|In patients with social anxiety disorder -LRB- SAD -RRB- it has been reported that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors -LRB- SSRIs -RRB- and placebo induce anxiolytic effects by attenuating neural activity in overlapping amygdala subregions , i.e. left basolateral and right ventrolateral amygdala .

24666527|We demonstrate that amygdala-frontal co-activation patterns differentiate effective from ineffective anxiolytic treatments and that SSRI and placebo responders share overlapping neuromodulatory paths that may underlie improved emotion regulation and reduced expression of anxiety .

24663011|An imbalance of the gamma-aminobutyric acid -LRB- GABA -RRB- system is considered a major neurobiological pathomechanism of anxiety , and the amygdala is a key brain region involved .

24662600|With serotonergic modulation , all these mechanisms should be recruited in lateral amygdala principal neurons and likely contribute to generation of region-specific neuronal activity patterns within the amygdala , which may at least partly implement its required role in fear and anxiety .

24657635|The evidence so far reported with the ETM supports the above hypothesis and indicates that : -LRB- 1 -RRB- whereas 5-HT neurons located at the dorsal raphe nucleus are involved in the regulation of both inhibitory avoidance and escape , those of the median raphe nucleus are primarily implicated in the former task ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- facilitation of 5-HT1A - and 5-HT2A-mediated neurotransmission in the dorsal periaqueductal gray -LRB- dPAG -RRB- is likely to mediate the panicolytic drug action ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- stimulation of 5-HT2C receptors in the basolateral amygdala increases anxiety and is implicated in the anxiogenesis caused by short-term administration of antidepressant drugs , and -LRB- 4 -RRB- 5-HT1A and the ?-opioid receptors work together in the dPAG to modulate escape or panic attacks .

24635708|A current neuroanatomical model of anxiety posits that greater structural connectivity between the amygdala and ventral prefrontal cortex -LRB- vPFC -RRB- facilitates regulatory control over the amygdala and helps reduce anxiety .

24635708|However , some neuroimaging studies have reported contradictory findings , demonstrating a positive rather than negative association between trait anxiety and amygdala-vPFC white matter integrity .

24635708|To help reconcile these findings , we tested the regulatory hypothesis of anxiety circuitry using aging as a model of white matter decline in the amygdala-vPFC pathway .

24635708|The relationship between these amygdala-vPFC structural connectivity measures and age and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory -LRB- STAI -RRB- scores were assessed .

24635708|Contrary to the regulatory hypothesis , we found a positive rather than negative association between trait anxiety and right amygdala-vPFC FA -LRB- p = .01 -RRB- .

24635708|These findings argue against the notion that greater amygdala-vPFC structural integrity facilitates better anxiety outcomes in healthy adults .

24631429|Emotional stress induced yawning behavior that was accompanied by anxiety-related behavior , and caused neuronal activation of the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , as well as increases in activity of both OT and CRF neurons in the PVN .

24631303|The ratio of levels of mRNAs for corticotropin releasing hormone -LRB- CRH -RRB- receptors 1 and 2 in the amygdala , measured for the first time in the pig , was substantially increased in 10-week-old female , but not male , PNS progeny indicating a neurobiological propensity for anxiety-related behaviour .

24622818|Specifically , we propose that this system implements feedback control to regulate symptoms as they arise -LRB- e.g. , excessive anxiety reduced via regulation of amygdala -RRB- , such that an intact control system is protective against a variety of mental illnesses .

24618807|Chronic exposure to stress has been widely implicated in the development of anxiety disorders , yet relatively little is known about the long-term effects of chronic stress on amygdala-dependent memory formation .

24603023|Cumulative activation during positive and negative events and state anxiety predicts subsequent inertia of amygdala reactivity . .

24603023|Finally , individuals with higher state anxiety displayed stronger modulation of amygdala reactivity by positive movies .

24603023|These results suggest that intensity and valence of emotional events as well as anxiety levels promote local changes in amygdala sensitivity to threat , highlighting the importance of past experience in shaping future affective reactivity .

24602036|There was a significant interaction between ELS and group on blood-oxygen-level-dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- amplitude during anticipatory anxiety in the right amygdala and bilateral orbitofrontal cortex , posterior putamen and insula .

24600410|The increase in the intrinsic connectivity of amygdala with the temporal poles was inversely correlated with symptom severity and anxiety scores .

24599464|Decreased anxiety-like behavior and G?q / 11-dependent responses in the amygdala of mice lacking TRPC4 channels . .

24599448|In the present study , these two behavioral assays were used to examine the role of norepinephrine -LRB- NE -RRB- transmission within the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- , each of which has been implicated in drug-withdrawal-induced anxiety and stress-induced response reinstatement .

24596089|XAP044 reduces freezing during acquisition of Pavlovian fear and reduces innate anxiety , which is consistent with the phenotypes of mGlu7-deficient mice , the results of mGlu7 siRNA knockdown studies , and the inhibition of amygdala LTP by XAP044 .

24594871|Modulation of resting-state amygdala-frontal functional connectivity by oxytocin in generalized social anxiety disorder . .

24594871|Generalized social anxiety disorder -LRB- GSAD -RRB- is characterized by aberrant patterns of amygdala-frontal connectivity to social signals of threat and at rest .

24594871|Higher social anxiety severity in GSAD subjects correlated with lower amygdala-ACC/mPFC connectivity on PBO and higher social anxiety also correlated with greater enhancement in amygdala-frontal connectivity induced by OXT .

24593853|A patient with an astrocytoma of the right-sided amygdala developed symptoms of separation anxiety disorders -LRB- SADs -RRB- .

24593853|The tumorigenesis of amygdala resulted in impaired regulation and abnormal activity associated with anticipating anxiety and conditioning .

24582917|Susceptible mice had significantly more c-Fos protein expression in neurons of the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- following CSDS and showed exaggerated conditioned fear responses , while there were no significant differences between groups in innate anxiety - and depressive-like behaviors .

24573273|ASIC1a activation enhances inhibition in the basolateral amygdala and reduces anxiety . .

24573273|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is central to fear generation , and anxiety disorders are characterized by BLA hyperexcitability .

24565178|This study aimed at examining the impact of an underwater trauma -LRB- UWT -RRB- reminder on anxiety-like behaviour and on neuronal activity and plasticity in the hippocampus and the amygdala .

24554670|Although the amygdala is important for emotional learning and other behaviors , including fear and anxiety , whether learning alters intrinsic excitability within the amygdala has received very little attention .

24529281|Genetic variation at ACCN2 appears to be associated with PD and with amygdala phenotypes that have been linked to proneness to anxiety .

24528596|Effects of histone deacetylase inhibitors on amygdaloid histone acetylation and neuropeptide Y expression : a role in anxiety-like and alcohol-drinking behaviours . .

24528596|Here , we investigated the effects of histone deacetylase -LRB- HDAC -RRB- inhibitor , trichostatin A -LRB- TSA -RRB- on amygdaloid HDAC-induced histone deacetylation and neuropeptide Y -LRB- NPY -RRB- expression and on anxiety-like and alcohol-drinking behaviours in alcohol-preferring -LRB- P -RRB- and - non-preferring -LRB- NP -RRB- rats .

24528596|It was found that P rats displayed higher anxiety-like and alcohol-drinking behaviours , higher amygdaloid nuclear , but not cytosolic , HDAC activity , which was associated with increased HDAC2 protein levels and deficits in histone acetylation and NPY expression in the central -LRB- CeA -RRB- and medial nucleus of amygdala -LRB- MeA -RRB- , as compared to NP rats .

24528596|TSA treatment attenuated the anxiety-like and alcohol-drinking behaviours , with concomitant reductions in amygdaloid nuclear , but not cytosolic HDAC activity , and HDAC2 , but not HDAC4 , protein levels in the CeA and MeA of P rats , without effect in NP rats .

24528596|These results suggest that higher HDAC2 expression-related deficits in histone acetylation may be involved in lower NPY expression in the amygdala of P rats , and operative in controlling anxiety-like and alcohol-drinking behaviours .

24528558|Previous neuroimaging studies have suggested an abnormal neural circuitry of emotion regulation including the amygdala and prefrontal cortex in both adult and adolescent generalized anxiety disorder -LRB- GAD -RRB- patients .

24523911|Increased amygdalar and hippocampal volumes in young adults with social anxiety . .

24523911|This study explored the existence of structural differences in the whole brain , amygdala , and hippocampus of subjects with clinical and subthreshold social anxiety compared to healthy controls .

24523911|Our results show amygdalar and hippocampal volume alterations in social anxiety , possibly associated with symptom severity .

24523680|The lateral/basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- forms an integral part of the neural circuitry controlling innate anxiety and learned fear .

24518397|Bidirectional rescue of extreme genetic predispositions to anxiety : impact of CRH receptor 1 as epigenetic plasticity gene in the amygdala . .

24518397|We provide evidence that -LRB- i -RRB- even inborn and seemingly rigid behavioral and neuroendocrine phenotypes can bidirectionally be rescued by appropriate environmental stimuli , -LRB- ii -RRB- corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 -LRB- Crhr1 -RRB- , critically involved in trait anxiety , shows bidirectional alterations in its expression in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- upon environmental stimulation , -LRB- iii -RRB- these alterations are linked to an increased methylation status of its promoter and , finally , -LRB- iv -RRB- binding of the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 -LRB- YY1 -RRB- to the Crhr1 promoter contributes to its gene expression in a methylation-sensitive manner .

24486384|The recovery of acetylcholinesterase activity and the progression of neuropathological and pathophysiological alterations in the rat basolateral amygdala after soman-induced status epilepticus : relation to anxiety-like behavior . .

24486384|This is not surprising considering that the amygdala , and the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- in particular , plays a central role in anxiety , and this structure suffers severe damage by nerve agent-induced seizures .

24485458|The extended amygdala has dominated research on the neural circuitry of fear and anxiety , but the septohippocampal axis also plays an important role .

24472740|In the present study , we investigated the role played by the CRF system within the medial amygdala -LRB- MeA -RRB- in the modulation of anxiety and fear-related responses .

24468014|Several studies have pointed to the amygdala as a main limbic station capable of regulating different stressful states such as anxiety and depression .

24456850|Relatedly , CRF systems have a prominent role in driving addiction via actions in the central extended amygdala , producing anxiety-like behavior , reward deficits , excessive , compulsive-like drug self-administration and stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking .

24452696|Within the brain , the anteroventral subdivision of the medial amygdala -LRB- MeAV -RRB- is an important area involved in processing emotional responses such as anxiety and a high density of NO-producing neurons is observed in this area .

24444996|Emerging evidence suggests the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- mediates both anxiety and addiction through connections with other brain regions , including the amygdala and nucleus accumbens .

24409407|A few studies have indicates that the sesame oil influences anxiety , but many reports show that ?-1 adrenoceptors -LRB- ARs -RRB- of the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- plays a pivotal role in this regard .

24403138|Restraint stress alters nociceptin/orphanin FQ and CRF systems in the rat central amygdala : significance for anxiety-like behaviors . .

24403138|Using in situ hybridization -LRB- ISH -RRB- , we assessed the effect of body restraint stress on the gene expression of CRF and N/OFQ-related genes in various subdivisions of the amygdala , a critical brain structure involved in the modulation of stress response and anxiety-like behaviors .

24399943|First , we confirmed our genetic manipulation by demonstrating that Y2R protein expression was decreased and that a Y2R agonist could not alter GABAergic transmission in the extended amygdala , a limbic brain region critically implicated in the regulation of anxiety and alcohol drinking behaviors , using immunofluorescence and slice electrophysiology .

24393393|These results challenge prevailing models that emphasize a role for amygdala automaticity in the maintenance of anxiety .

24376834|Circadian modulation of anxiety : a role for somatostatin in the amygdala . .

24373901|We focused on two brain areas , the amygdala -LRB- of importance for the mediation of fear and anxiety -RRB- and the dorsal raphe -LRB- i.e. the site of origin of major afferent serotonin pathways , including those that project to the amygdala -RRB- .

24361909|Because alterations in Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor -LRB- BDNF -RRB- and monoamine levels in the hippocampus and amygdala have been associated with anxiety disorders , we hypothesized that chronic treatment with a low dose of estradiol would cause anxiety-like disorder by altering BDNF and monoamine levels in these regions .

24342924|With a well-validated nonhuman primate model of AT , we examined expression of the NPY system in the central nucleus -LRB- Ce -RRB- of the amygdala , a critical neural substrate for extreme anxiety .

24334024|Periodic maternal deprivation may modulate offspring anxiety-like behavior through mechanisms involving neuroplasticity in the amygdala . .

24334024|The combination of these findings suggests that the mild stressor , PMD alters anxiety-like behavior in offspring likely by influencing HAn dams ' L/G activity and altering stress related proteins in the amygdala .

24333573|The critical role of cannabinoidergic and serotonergic systems of the amygdala in modulation of anxiety-like behaviors and emotional memory has already been demonstrated .

24325918|Exposure to stress rapidly mobilizes FAAH to deplete the signaling pool of AEA and increase neuronal excitability in a key anxiety-mediating region -- the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

24314348|Although acute heroin administration was found to reduce anxiety , craving , and stress hormone release , whether these effects are reflected in amygdala activity has not yet been investigated .

27000470|It was noticed that most findings reflect the current neurobiological hypothesis of PD , where inhibitory deficits of the prefrontal cortex related to the modulation of amygdala activity , and the subsequent activation of subcortical regions , may be responsible to trigger anxiety responses .

24279756|Early life stress -LRB- ELS -RRB- causes alterations in emotionality and anxiety levels as a significant risk factor for psychiatric problems , and these alterations have been associated with amygdala activity .

24277819|Although recent work has focused on the amygdala as the locus of aversive memory formation , the hypothalamus has long been implicated in emotional regulation , and the hypothalamic neuropeptide orexin -LRB- hypocretin -RRB- is involved in anxiety states and arousal .

24277809|Individual differences in amygdala-PFC circuitry function have been linked to trait anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder .

24268662|Even in children as young as ages 7 to 9 , high childhood anxiety is associated with enlarged amygdala volume and this enlargement is localized specifically to the basolateral amygdala .

24268662|High childhood anxiety is also associated with increased connectivity between the amygdala and distributed brain systems involved in attention , emotion perception , and regulation , and these effects are most prominent in basolateral amygdala .

24268662|Critically , machine learning algorithms revealed that levels of childhood anxiety could be reliably predicted by amygdala morphometry and intrinsic functional connectivity , with the left basolateral amygdala emerging as the strongest predictor .

24268662|Individual differences in anxiety can be reliably detected with high predictive value in amygdala-centric emotion circuits at a surprisingly young age .

24264880|Furthermore , behavioral analysis of basolateral amygdala PTEN knockdown suggests that these changes limited only to the basolateral amygdala complex may not be sufficient to induce increased anxiety-related behaviors .

24262816|Despite knowledge of amygdala involvement in fear and anxiety , its contribution to the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder -LRB- OCD -RRB- remains controversial .

24261121|Hippocampus , amygdala and dorsal raphe nucleus are the cerebral main structures involved in learning , memory and anxiety .

24259585|Trait anxiety was also positively correlated with amygdala-based '' emotional '' system activation and its coupling with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- when decisions were consistent with the framing effect , but negatively correlated with the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- dACC -RRB- - based '' analytic '' system activation and its connectivity to the vmPFC when decisions ran counter to the framing effect .

24240029|In this study , we examined the influence of early unpredictable trauma on both the behavioral expression of adult anxiety and gene expression within the amygdala .

24229536|In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study of healthy adolescents , we found that prior exposure to severe adverse life events was associated with current anxiety and with increased amygdala reactivity to standardized emotional stimuli -LRB- viewing of fearful faces relative to calm ones -RRB- .

24229536|Conjunction analyses identified multiple regions , including the amygdala , insula , and prefrontal cortex , in which reactivity to emotional faces covaried with life events as well as with current anxiety .

24194694|The central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , a key limbic structure with one of the highest concentrations of CRF-producing cells outside of the hypothalamus , has been implicated in anxiety-like behavior and a number of stress-induced disorders .

24182621|Activation of ERK2 in basolateral amygdala underlies the promoting influence of stress on fear memory and anxiety : influence of midazolam pretreatment . .

24182621|Therefore , given that the ERK1/2 cascade is activated following stress and that the role of this cascade is critical in the formation of fear memory , the present study investigated the potential involvement of p-ERK2 in amygdala subnuclei in the promoting influence of stress on fear memory formation and on anxiety-like behavior .

24179799|Both , change in VLPFC activation and amygdala-prefrontal connectivity were correlated with change in Beck Anxiety Inventory -LRB- BAI -RRB- scores , suggesting clinical relevance of these changes .

24169802|The central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- mediates several addiction-related processes and nociceptin/orphanin FQ -LRB- nociceptin -RRB- regulates ethanol intake and anxiety-like behaviors .

24142122|Research on pathophysiology is still in its infancy , but some brain regions , such as the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex , have been implicated in fear and anxiety .

24151118|The first section of the manuscript highlights the pivotal role of exaggerated threat responses-mediated by circuits connecting the frontal cortex , amygdala , and midbrain-in anxiety , and reviews data indicating that genotypic variation in the serotonin system is associated with hyperactivity in this circuitry , which elevates the risk for anxiety and mood disorders .

24139460|In a previous study , acupuncture at acupoint HT7 attenuated ethanol withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behavior in rats by normalizing amygdaloid catecholamines .

24121061|Five days after conditioning , anxiety-like behavior was examined with the open field test and brain tissue was collected to assess serotonin -LRB- 5-hydroxytryptamine , 5-HT -RRB- and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid -LRB- 5-HIAA -RRB- in the dorsal raphe , amygdala , and hippocampus by high-pressure liquid chromatography -LRB- HPLC -RRB- .

24108802|Disrupted effective connectivity between the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex in social anxiety disorder during emotion discrimination revealed by dynamic causal modeling for FMRI . .

24107957|Real-time imaging of amygdalar network dynamics in vitro reveals a neurophysiological link to behavior in a mouse model of extremes in trait anxiety . .

24107957|Here , we applied voltage-sensitive dye imaging to brain slices from animals of the high -LRB- HAB -RRB- , normal -LRB- NAB -RRB- , and low -LRB- LAB -RRB- trait anxiety mouse model and investigated whether evoked neuronal activity propagations from the lateral -LRB- LA -RRB- to the central -LRB- CeA -RRB- amygdala differ in their relative strength among HAB , NAB , and LAB mice .

24107957|Collectively , these findings provide evidence that , in mammals , interindividual variability in trait anxiety is causally linked to individual variations in the physiological constitution of the LA-to-CeA circuitry that give rise to a differential regulation of neuronal signal flow through this fundamental input-output network of the amygdala .

24105443|Social anxiety disorder -LRB- SAD -RRB- has been associated with hyper-reactivity in limbic brain regions like the amygdala , both during symptom provocation and emotional face processing tasks .

24105443|Within the SAD group , social anxiety severity correlated positively with amygdala reactivity to emotional faces , amygdala-fusiform connectivity and connectivity between the amygdala and superior temporal sulcus -LRB- STS -RRB- .

24105443|These findings point to a pivotal role for the fusiform gyrus in SAD neuropathology , and further suggest that altered amygdala-fusiform and amygdala-STS connectivity could underlie previous findings of aberrant socio-emotional information processing in this anxiety disorder .

24103311|Development of anxiety-like behaviours during ethanol withdrawal has been correlated with increased histone deacetylase -LRB- HDAC -RRB- activity and decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor -LRB- BDNF -RRB- and activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein -LRB- Arc -RRB- gene expression in the amygdala .

24102648|These detailed quantitative data on dopamine transporter-positive innervation in the human amygdaloid complex can offer a useful reference in future studies aimed at analysing putative dysfunctions of this system in diseases involving brain dopamine , such as certain anxiety disorders , Parkinson 's disease and schizophrenia .

24068799|In parallel , the olfactory sensory relay adapts with increased anxiety , incorporating amygdala as an integral step via strengthened -LRB- afferent or efferent -RRB- connections between amygdala and all levels of the olfactory cortical hierarchy .

24064198|Changes in the amygdala were related to a behavioral measure of social anxiety .

24051621|Moreover , the blood oxygenation level-dependent change within the left amygdala in response to neutral faces during the judgment of approachability was positively correlated with participant trait anxiety .

24039023|On the functional neurobiological level , specific brain regions involved in the processing of anxiety-laden stimuli and in emotion regulation have been shown to be hyperactive and hyper-responsive in SAD such as amygdala , insula and orbito - and prefrontal cortex .

24036129|Indeed , it is suggested that amygdala abnormalities are related to the co-morbid depression and anxiety reported in MTLE .

24019460|Despite being age-atypical , negative amygdala-mPFC coupling conferred some degree of reduced anxiety , although anxiety was still significantly higher in the previously institutionalized group .

23986266|5-HTTLPR , anxiety and gender interaction moderates right amygdala volume in healthy subjects . .

23986266|In addition , a three-way significant interaction among genotype , gender and anxiety category was found for the right amygdala volume .

23986266|The reported interaction effects demonstrate that gender strongly modulates the relationship between 5-HTTLPR genotype and subclinical expression of anxiety acting on amygdala , one region of the emotional neural network specifically involved in the anxiety-like behaviours .

23978486|Low to moderate progesterone/allopregnanolone concentrations in women increases the activity in the amygdala -LRB- measured with fMRI -RRB- similar to the changes seen during anxiety reactions .

23972595|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and ventral hippocampus -LRB- vHPC -RRB- have both been implicated in mediating anxiety-related behaviors , but the functional contribution of BLA inputs to the vHPC has never been directly investigated .

23968960|The results reveal a significant relation between antenatal maternal depression and the neonatal microstructure of the right amygdala , a brain region closely associated with stress reactivity and vulnerability for mood anxiety disorders .

23965605|Stress and depression are associated with aberrant neuroplasticity in the amygdala : there is increased dendritic arborization and synaptogenesis , perhaps explaining the increased anxiety and fear that are often apparent in depressed patients .

23954317|Recent research has linked nonconscious attentional bias to threat with variability in the integrity of the amygdala - anterior cingulate pathway , which sheds light on the neuroanatomical basis for a behavioral precursor to anxiety .

23948217|Since the hippocampus , amygdala and dorsal periaqueductal grey have also been associated to anxiety disorders , including PTSD , we also verified if this procedure would modify the nitrergic system in these regions .

23937887|Evidence suggests that serotonin receptor subtype 5-HT2CR in the amygdala contributes critically to anxiogenic behavior and anxiety disorders .

23903032|Here we tested the acute effects of Zembrin administration in a pharmaco-fMRI study focused on anxiety-related activity in the amygdala and its connected neurocircuitry .

23891965|Compared to controls , rMDD women demonstrated higher anxiety ratings , increased cortisol levels , and hyperactivation in the amygdala and hippocampus , p < 0.05 , family-wise error -LRB- FWE -RRB- - corrected in response to the stress challenge .

23861215|Exaggerated amygdala and reduced ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- responsiveness during emotional processing have been reported in studies examining individual anxiety disorders .

23861215|A group comprising all three anxiety disorders showed greater activation within the left amygdala and reduced activation within the vmPFC compared to the HC group during the masked fear versus neutral condition .

23861215|Exclusive of specific diagnostic category , anxiety disorders were generally associated with increased activation of the amygdala and reduced activation within vmPFC .

23845323|These results suggest that CRF1 activation within the mPFC attenuates predator-induced unconditioned anxiety-like defensive behaviors , likely via inhibition of specific amygdalar nuclei .

23831916|In relation to the neuronal metabolic activity , EE reduced the COx activity in brain regions related to anxiety response , such as the infralimbic cortex , the paraventricular thalamic and hypothalamic nucleus , the basolateral amygdala , and the ventral hippocampus .

23828425|Anxiety and mood disorders in adolescence have been linked to abnormally increased activity in the amygdala and ventral prefrontal cortical areas , although some data suggest that neural abnormalities in the amygdala and anxiety maybe particularly more frequent in adolescents than in adults .

23825863|In animal models , stress and depression are associated with excitatory changes in the amygdala ; this aberrant neuroplasticity may represent increased fear learning , explaining the anxiety , fear , and related symptoms that characterize clinical depression .

23823694|Accumulating evidence suggests that dysfunction of the amygdala is related to abnormal fear processing , anxiety , and social behaviors noted in autistic spectrum disorders -LRB- ASDs -RRB- .

23804084|However , excessive anticipatory responding and associated hyper-reactivity in the amygdala and insula are integral to anxiety disorders .

23800343|Both regions are involved in the stress response , but the amygdala is also involved in mediating response to fear and anxiety .

23793355|Rimonabant precipitates anxiety in rats withdrawn from palatable food : role of the central amygdala . .

23791934|Serotonergic neurons projecting from the DRN to the amygdala facilitate learned anxiety producing an anxiogenic effect , while those projecting from the periaqueductal grey affect innate anxiety producing a panicolytic effect .

23791455|Persistent overexpression of DNA methyltransferase 1 attenuating GABAergic inhibition in basolateral amygdala accounts for anxiety in rat offspring exposed perinatally to low-dose bisphenol A. .

23777796|Gene expression in amygdala as a function of differential trait anxiety levels in genetically heterogeneous NIH-HS rats . .

23777796|To identify genes involved in anxiety/fear traits , we analyzed the gene expression profile in the amygdala of genetically heterogeneous NIH-HS rats .

23769820|Thus , in the aged group , brain regions involved in anxiety-like behaviour , such as the amygdala or the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis had more relevance ; whereas in the young enriched group the frontal and the hippocampal subregions had more contribution .

23769728|This study examined single unit activity in the lateral septum -LRB- LS -RRB- and the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- in the open and closed arms of the elevated plus-maze , a highly validated animal model of fear and anxiety .

23766101|The basal amygdala as well as the GABAergic system regulate trait anxiety .

23766101|Because most dendritic shafts exhibiting excitatory synapses are GABAergic interneurons , the results predict disinhibition , which would increase excitability of the amygdaloid network , in turn augmenting ABA animals ' anxiety .

23764459|In conclusion , FLX exposure during pregnancy and lactation decreases acute amygdalar stress response to a psychological stressor in males -LRB- adolescents and adults -RRB- as well as influences the behavior of adolescents -LRB- males and females -RRB- in a model that evaluates anxiety and/or depressive-like behavior .

23748930|GR protein is present in the human hypothalamus and hippocampus , but little is known-neither in healthy subjects nor in depressed patients-about GR expression in the amygdala , a brain structure involved in fear and anxiety .

23748225|Following chronic diet alternation , the effects of microinfusing the CRF1 receptor antagonist R121919 -LRB- 0 , 0.5 , 1.5 ?g / side -RRB- in the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BlA -RRB- , or the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- were evaluated on excessive intake of the palatable diet , chow hypophagia , and anxiety-like behavior .

23747571|Excessive drug taking engages activation of CRF not only in the extended amygdala , accompanied by anxiety-like states , but also in the medial prefrontal cortex , accompanied by deficits in executive function that may facilitate the transition to compulsive-like responding .

23730292|Moreover , adolescent males displayed an increase in anxiety-like behavior and an up-regulation of CRF mRNA in the amygdala during nicotine exposure and withdrawal .

23721965|Anterior olfactory organ removal produces anxiety-like behavior and increases spontaneous neuronal firing rate in basal amygdala . .

23721965|Some chemical cues may produce signs of anxiety and fear mediated by amygdala nuclei , but unknown is the role of two anterior olfactory epithelial organs , the septal and vomeronasal organs -LRB- SO-VNOs -RRB- .

23721965|The present results suggest the participation of SO-VNO/accessory olfactory bulb/basal amygdala relationships in the regulation of anxiety through a process of disinhibition .

23694905|Inhibition of OCT3-mediated transport by corticosterone may represent a mechanism by which acute stress alters dopaminergic neurotransmission in the amygdala , leading to alterations in fear and anxiety-like behavior .

23685230|Changes on auditory physiology in response to the inactivation of amygdala nuclei in high anxiety rats expressing learned fear . .

23685230|In humans and laboratory animals , pathological anxiety is often accompanied by heightened vigilance and alertness , hyperactivity of the amygdala -LRB- AM -RRB- , and increased amplitude of the auditory evoked potentials -LRB- AEP -RRB- from the IC .

23684859|Specifically , the correlation between amygdala-hippocampus connectivity and Gray 's trait anxiety scores is positive in individuals homozygous for the TPH2 G-allele , while carriers of at least one T-allele show a negative association .

23672796|However , we show that 5-HT deficiency leads to significant alterations in SGK-1 and GSK3? signalling and NMDA receptor expression in the amygdala in response to MS. Together , these findings support a potential role for 5-HT-dependent signalling in the amygdala in regulating the long-term effects of early life stress on anxiety-like behaviour and behavioural disinhibition .

23669322|Additionally , GPR30 expression in the amygdala of ovariectomized -LRB- OVX -RRB- mice significantly increased after acute stress and was accompanied by anxiety-like behaviors .

23665938|Gene expression profiles in the amygdala of juvenile rats were compared between the two autistic rat models for mechanistic insights into impaired social behavior and enhanced anxiety in autism .

23665938|It was considered that gene expression changes per se in the amygdala might be an important cause for impaired social behavior and enhanced anxiety , rather than expression changes of particular genes .

23665375|Cognitive models posit that preferential processing of threat mediates excessive forms of anxiety , which is supported by exaggerated amygdala , insula , and cortical reactivity to threatening socio-emotional signals in SAD .

23643103|A positive correlation of anxiety symptom severity was found on amygdala-dorsal anterior cingulate and dorsal mPFC connectivity during perception of fearful faces .

23641742|Interaction between morphine and noradrenergic system of basolateral amygdala on anxiety and memory in the elevated plus-maze test based on a test-retest paradigm . .

23641742|The amygdala is the key brain structure for anxiety and emotional memory storage .

23626528|Excitotoxic lesions in the central nucleus of the amygdala attenuate stress-induced anxiety behavior . .

23626528|The extended amygdala , composed by the amygdaloid nuclei and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- , plays a critical role in anxiety behavior .

23626528|In particular , the link between the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- and the BNST seems to be critical to the formation of anxiety-like behavior .

23626528|Chronic unpredictable stress -LRB- CUS -RRB- exposure is recognized as a validated animal model of anxiety and is known to trigger significant morphofunctional changes in the extended amygdala .

23624153|As medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala are implicated in many of these disorders , understanding differential stress effects in these regions may shed light on the mechanisms underlying sex-dependent expression of disorders like depression and anxiety .

23576070|Freezing behavior in response to 22-kHz USV is paralleled by increased neuronal activity in brain areas regulating fear and anxiety , such as the amygdala and periaqueductal gray , whereas social approach behavior elicited by 50-kHz USV is accompanied by reduced activity levels in the amygdala but enhanced activity in the nucleus accumbens , a brain area implicated in reward processing .

23574145|Specifically , after uncontrollable stressor exposure subsequent anxiogenic stimuli evoke greater 5-HT release in DRN terminal regions including the amygdala and striatum ; and pharmacological blockade of postsynaptic 5-HT -LRB- 2C -RRB- receptors in these regions prevents expression of stressor-induced anxiety .

23547713|Generalized social anxiety disorder -LRB- gSAD -RRB- is associated with a heightened neural sensitivity to signals that convey threat , as evidenced by exaggerated amygdala and/or insula activation when processing face stimuli that express negative emotions .

23538303|Furthermore , activity in these phenotype-selective regions mediated relations between amygdala metabolism and different expressions of anxiety .

23538069|Chronic stress may contribute to affective disorders such as depression and anxiety via its effects on the amygdala .

23536785|It is thought to be characterized by an exaggerated amygdalar and decreased medial prefrontal activation to which the elevated anxiety state and concomitant inadequate emotional regulation are attributed .

23531435|We recently reported that a Prkar1a heterozygote -LRB- Prkar1a -LRB- + / - -RRB- -RRB- mouse with haploinsufficiency for the main regulatory subunit -LRB- R1? -RRB- of protein kinase A -LRB- PKA -RRB- exhibits an anxiety-like phenotype associated with increased cAMP signaling in the amygdala .

23531435|Dysregulated PKA activity in the amygdala-prefrontal cortex circuitry in Prkar1a -LRB- + / - -RRB- mice is associated with behavioral phenotype of anxiety and a bias for threat .

23524192|Since both MeA and nearby amygdaloid nuclei are involved in fear/anxiety processing , two types of MeA GABAergic projection neurons and a third type of interneurons that might participate in anxiety-related behavior were revealed by my present study .

23523745|Rats treated with three daily urocortin 1 -LRB- UCN -RRB- injections into the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA ; i.e. , UCN/BLA-primed rats -RRB- develop prolonged anxiety-associated behavior and vulnerability to panic-like physiological responses -LRB- i.e. , tachycardia , hypertension and tachypnea -RRB- following intravenous infusions of 0.5 M sodium lactate -LRB- NaLac , an ordinarily mild interoceptive stressor -RRB- .

23520499|Correlation analyses showed that Gray 's trait Anxiety was significantly associated with mean ReHo in both the amygdala and the hippocampus .

23520499|Specifically , Gray 's trait Anxiety explained 23 % and 17 % of resting-state ReHo variance in the left amygdala and the left hippocampus , respectively .

23515889|In addition , strong and discrete expression of their receptors in the extended amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis suggests a potential role in regulating stress responses , emotion , anxiety , and fear .

23515155|The extended amygdala , including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- , modulates fear and anxiety , but also projects to the ventral tegmental area -LRB- VTA -RRB- , a region implicated in reward and aversion , thus providing a candidate neural substrate for integrating diverse emotional states .

23499791|Serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region -LRB- 5-HTTLPR -RRB- has been associated with modulation of resting-state amygdala level , which was considered to underlie a risk for mood and anxiety disorders .

23499701|The relevance of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptors of the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- in the mediation of anxiety-related defensive responses has long been acknowledged .

23495221|The amygdala also plays a crucial role in the expression of anxiety and may contribute to high rates of reported anxiety in individuals with ASD .

23495221|These findings held for all levels of anxiety , suggesting that within the context of the fear-potentiated startle paradigm , amygdala response is not associated with degree of atypical social or emotional functioning in ASD .

23494464|Serotonergic innervation of the amygdala : targets , receptors , and implications for stress and anxiety . .

23494464|The amygdala is a core component of neural circuits that mediate processing of emotional , particularly anxiety and fear-related stimuli across species .

23485013|Aberrant histone deacetylase2-mediated histone modifications and synaptic plasticity in the amygdala predisposes to anxiety and alcoholism . .

23485013|We employed HDAC2 small interfering RNA infusion into the central nucleus of amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- of P rats to determine the causal role of HDAC2 in anxiety-like and alcohol-drinking behaviors .

23485013|Acute ethanol exposure decreased amygdaloid HDAC activity and HDAC2 protein levels , increased global and gene -LRB- Bdnf and Arc -RRB- - specific histone acetylation , and attenuated anxiety-like behaviors in P rats but had no effects in NP rats .

23480228|Progesterone treatment decreases traumatic brain injury induced anxiety and is correlated with increased serum IGF-1 levels ; prefrontal cortex , amygdala , hippocampus neuron density ; and reduced serum corticosterone levels in immature rats . .

23479945|They also play a very important role in modulating fear and anxiety response , especially by regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and amygdala activity by its projections to the brain stem and hypothalamic structures .

23477296|In addition , between the groups , the hippocampus displayed a pattern of reverse coupling with the amygdala and insula that was also significantly correlated with trait anxiety .

23470280|Glutamatergic neurotransmission in the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- plays an important role in many behaviors including anxiety , memory consolidation and cardiovascular responses .

23458743|Further , we investigated mRNA expression of CRFR1 and mGlu5R in the prelimbic cortex and amygdala , since these transmitter systems are not only involved in the regulation of anxiety , but are indicated to be co-expressed in relevant brain areas .

23454542|We studied the influence of high-fat diet exposure during pre-weaning development in rats on gene expression in the amygdala and hippocampus by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction -LRB- PCR -RRB- , anxiety behavior in the Open field , elevated plus maze and light-dark transition tasks , and corticosterone levels in response to stress by radioimmunoassay .

23452685|Intrinsic functional connectivity of amygdala-based networks in adolescent generalized anxiety disorder . .

23452685|We also assessed the relationship between amygdala network dysfunction and anxiety severity .

23452685|Positive correlations between anxiety severity scores and amygdala functional connectivity with insula and superior temporal gyrus were also observed within the GAD group .

23452205|High levels of mGlu2 receptors are seen in brain areas such as prefrontal cortex , hippocampus and amygdala where glutamate hyperfunction may be implicated in disorders and diseases such as anxiety and schizophrenia .

23445555|Depressive symptoms correlated with increased amygdala metabolism ; anxiety scores correlated with decreased caudate metabolism , and apathy scores correlated with increased metabolism in the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal lobe and decreased metabolism in the temporoparietal association cortex .

23442196|The relation between amygdala volume and clinical features such as symptom severity , disgust sensitivity , trait anxiety and duration of illness was investigated by Spearman correlation analysis .

23442196|Furthermore , the diminished amygdala size in patients was related to higher symptom severity , but not to higher disgust sensitivity or trait anxiety and was independent of age .

23440464|A corticolimbic circuit including the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- plays an important role in regulating sensitivity to threat , which is heightened in mood and anxiety disorders .

23438699|The amygdala is involved in the pathophysiology of phobias and anxiety .

23438699|Both top-down inhibition mechanisms and emotional face recognition are altered in anxiety disorders , particularly in specific and social phobia , resulting in reduced amygdalar activity inhibition after anxiety - or fear - inducing stimulus perception .

23433857|GMV reductions in bilateral fusiform gyrus and amygdala were observed in concordant affected twins for anxiety and depression compared to healthy twins .

23433857|As concordant affected MZ twins are believed to have a particularly high genetic liability for the disorder , our findings suggest that fusiform gyrus and amygdala gray matter reductions are related to a genetic risk for anxiety and depression .

23426383|Thirty days after the last exposure to stress , rats demonstrated impaired long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- in the ventral subiculum-nucleus accumbens -LRB- NAc -RRB- pathway , impaired performance in the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- - dependent object-recognition task and the hippocampal-dependent spatial version of this task , increased anxiety levels , and significantly reduced expression of glucocorticoid receptors -LRB- GRs -RRB- in the amygdala , hippocampus , PFC , and NAc .

23415758|The contribution of TNF-? in the amygdala to anxiety in mice with persistent inflammatory pain . .

23415758|The amygdala is a forebrain structure that modulates anxiety .

23383129|Six months following peripheral nerve injury , abnormal sensory thresholds and increased anxiety were accompanied by decreased global methylation in the PFC and the amygdala but not in the visual cortex or the thalamus .

23383000|Low dose prenatal ethanol exposure induces anxiety-like behaviour and alters dendritic morphology in the basolateral amygdala of rat offspring . .

23383000|This study used a rat model to determine if prenatal exposure to a relatively small amount of alcohol would result in anxiety-like behaviour and to determine if this was associated with morphological changes in the basolateral amygdala .

23383000|This study is the first to link increases in anxiety like behaviour to structural changes within the basolateral amygdala in a model of prenatal ethanol exposure .

23368426|Enkephalin knockdown in the central amygdala nucleus reduces unconditioned fear and anxiety . .

23368426|The endogenous opioid enkephalins -LRB- ENK -RRB- are highly expressed in the central nucleus of the amygdaloid complex -LRB- CeA -RRB- where several lines of evidence point to a potential role in the modulation of fear and anxiety .

23364872|As recently shown in healthy volunteers , dopamine storage capacity -LRB- V d -RRB- in the left amygdala was positively correlated with functional activation in the left amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- during an emotional task ; high functional connectivity between the amygdala and the ACC , a region important for emotion regulation , was associated with low trait anxiety .

23364872|Furthermore , we asked whether disrupted functional coupling between amygdala and ACC during aversive processing is related to trait anxiety.We used combined 6 - -LSB- 18F -RSB- - fluoro-l-DOPA positron emission tomography -LRB- PET -RRB- , functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- and Spielberger 's state-trait anxiety questionnaire -LRB- STAI -RRB- in 11 male detoxified alcohol-dependent patients compared to 13 matched healthy controls.Unlike healthy controls , patients showed no significant correlation between our PET metric for dopamine storage capacity -LRB- FDOPA V d -RRB- , in left amygdala and activation in left ACC .

23364872|Voxel-based morphometry did not reveal any discernible group differences in amygdala volume.These results suggest that dopamine-modulated corticolimbic circuit function is important for responding to emotional information such that apparent functional deficits in this neuromodulatory circuitry may contribute to trait anxiety in alcohol-dependent patients .

23358240|Neuropeptide Y -LRB- NPY -RRB- administration into the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- decreases anxiety-like behavior , mediated in part through the Y1 receptor -LRB- Y1R -RRB- isoform .

23357445|Using voxel-based morphometry and magnetic resonance imaging , associations of BDNF and clinical anxiety with regional GMVs of anterior cingulate cortex , insula , amygdala , and hippocampus were examined in 39 affected -LRB- 17 Met allele carriers , 22 Val/Val homozygotes -RRB- and 63 nonaffected adolescents -LRB- 27 -LSB- corrected -RSB- Met allele carriers , 36 -LSB- corrected -RSB- Val/Val homozygotes -RRB- .

23357445|These results implicate reduced GMV in the amygdala and hippocampus in pediatric anxiety , particularly social phobia .

23352317|Application of insulin to the amygdala , prior to exposure to traumatic stress , reduced post-stress anxiety and serum corticosterone levels only in the responders .

23349968|They also had a reduced 5-HT -LRB- 1A -RRB- receptor BP in amygdala -LRB- p = 0.029 -RRB- , ACC -LRB- p = 0.005 -RRB- -LRB- planned comparisons , significance level 0.05 -RRB- , and insular cortex -LRB- p = 0.003 ; significance level p < 0.005 with Bonferroni correction -RRB- , and showed an inverse correlation between degree of anxiety and the BP in the amygdala -LRB- planned comparison -RRB- .

23348009|During the appraisal condition , allopregnanolone increased activity in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex and enhanced connectivity between the amygdala and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex , an effect that was associated with reduced self-reported anxiety .

23347699|Rearing in enriched environment increases parvalbumin-positive small neurons in the amygdala and decreases anxiety-like behavior of male rats . .

23347699|Here we investigated whether rearing in enriched environment could modify the expression of parvalbumin-positive neurons in the basolateral amygdala and anxiety-like behavior .

23347699|The results suggest that rearing in the enriched environment augmented parvalbumin-positive specific neurons in the basolateral amygdala , which induced behavioral plasticity that was reflected by a decrease in anxiety-like behavior in anxiogenic situations .

23336736|For example , sex differences in CRF receptor binding in the amygdala of rats may predispose females to greater anxiety following stressful events .

23335892|The results are consistent with neuroanatomic models of the role of the amygdala in fear conditioning , and the importance of the limbic circuitry in mediating anxiety symptoms .

23328629|Previous research has shown that anxiety symptoms in healthy individuals are associated with variations in the volume of brain regions , such as the amygdala , hippocampus , and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis .

23328629|We found that lesioned brain regions in cortical and limbic areas of the left hemisphere , including middle , inferior and superior temporal lobe , hippocampus , and fusiform regions , along with smaller areas in the inferior occipital lobe , parahippocampus , amygdala , and insula , were associated with increased anxiety symptoms as measured by the Neurobehavioral Rating Scale -LRB- NRS -RRB- .

23321806|These clinical findings have been extended to animal models wherein SSRIs also potentiate anxiety and fear learning , which depend on the amygdala .

23321806|These findings highlight the need to look beyond the traditional focus on input nuclei of the amygdala and add to accumulating evidence implicating these microcircuits in gating fear and anxiety .

23319313|The long rather than the short allele of 5-HTTLPR predisposes Han Chinese to anxiety and reduced connectivity between prefrontal cortex and amygdala . .

23319313|In healthy participants , L-carriers had reduced functional and anatomical connectivity between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- , which was correlated with anxiety or depression scores .

23319313|Our findings demonstrated that in Chinese Han participants , in contrast to Caucasians , the L-allele confers vulnerability to anxiety or depression and weakens top-down emotional control between the PFC and amygdala .

23307330|We identified that motilin receptor is highly expressed in GABAergic interneurons in the basolateral nucleus -LRB- BLA -RRB- of the amygdala , the structure of which is closely involved in assigning stress disorder and anxiety .

23305653|Several neurobiological models of anxiety disorder posit a primary role for dysfunction of the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- .

23305653|This study tests the hypothesis that patients with generalized anxiety disorder -LRB- GAD -RRB- have abnormal white matter microstructure in the amygdala and ACC , as inferred from diffusion tensor imaging , compared with healthy controls .

23305653|Higher right amygdala FA correlated significantly with higher Hamilton Anxiety Scale scores and higher Penn State Worry Questionnaire scores .

23299040|Since cocaine - and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide -LRB- CART -RRB- regulates anxiety and stress in amygdala , we hypothesized that the peptide may also process negative psychological experience like fear .

23267723|Overall these data support our hypothesis that amygdalar CRF is critical in anxiety-like behavior ; because the antidepressant was unable to reverse behavioral manifestations of CeA CRF-OE .

23226060|Decreased transcriptional activity of the S allele -LRB- '' risk allele '' -RRB- may be associated with a heightened amygdala response leading to anxiety-related personality traits , major depressive disorder , suicide attempts , and bipolar disorder .

23224805|The amygdala was identified as one of the key regions of the brain involved in the processing of fear , anxiety , and pain -LRB- induced by visual images -RRB- .

23223206|Analyses comparing only the ASD and SAD groups revealed greater bilateral amygdala activation to social rewards in SAD relative to ASD during both anticipation and outcome phases , and the magnitude of left amygdala hyperactivation in the SAD group during social reward anticipation was significantly correlated with the severity of trait anxiety symptoms .

23209643|Increased neural habituation in the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex in social anxiety disorder revealed by FMRI . .

23201176|The current study set out to examine the effects of SPS on GR and pAkt protein levels in the amygdala and hippocampus and to examine the specificity of these changes to unconditioned anxiety-like behavior .

23198599|Benzodiazepines also inhibit the amygdala , thereby reducing fear or anxiety .

23184639|Aberrant amygdala-frontal cortex connectivity during perception of fearful faces and at rest in generalized social anxiety disorder . .

23184639|Generalized social anxiety disorder -LRB- gSAD -RRB- is characterized by exaggerated amygdala reactivity to social signals of threat , but if and how the amygdala interacts with functionally and anatomically connected prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- remains largely unknown .

23184639|These findings prompt further studies to better delineate intrinsic and externally evoked brain connectivity in anxiety and depression in relation to amygdala dysfunction .

23168129|Although the neurobiological mechanisms underlying panic disorder -LRB- PD -RRB- are not yet clearly understood , increasing amount of evidence from animal and human studies suggests that the amygdala , which plays a pivotal role in neural network of fear and anxiety , has an important role in the pathogenesis of PD .

23154094|The neural responses in the left amygdala are significantly correlated with the severity of depression and comorbid anxiety .

23151390|Although typically regarded as a risk factor for mood and anxiety disorders , threat-related amygdala reactivity may serve as a protective factor against substance use disorders , particularly in individuals with exaggerated responsiveness to reward .

23149445|In mammals , ?-aminobutyric acid -LRB- GABA -RRB- transmission in the amygdala is particularly important for controlling levels of fear and anxiety .

23146966|Furthermore , we found significant relationships between FMR1 gene expression , anxiety/social dysfunction scores , and reduced amygdala activation in the FX group .

23143517|For females , adolescent amygdala-vmPFC functional connectivity was inversely correlated with concurrent anxiety symptoms but positively associated with depressive symptoms , suggesting differing pathways from childhood cortisol levels function through adolescent amygdala-vmPFC functional connectivity to anxiety and depression .

23142759|Within the amygdala , optogenetics has allowed the study of intra-amygdala microcircuitry as well as interconnections with distal regions involved in fear and anxiety .

23137801|Blood-oxygen-level dependent signal changes in regions involved in anxiety -LRB- amygdala -RRB- and detailed visual processing -LRB- ventral visual stream-VVS -RRB- were regressed on anxiety scores .

23123362|The results indicated that : -LRB- 1 -RRB- they both attenuated activity in the right amygdala and right insula , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- placebo effect activated the left subgenual cingulate whereas reappraisal activated the right dorsal prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- and the left inferior PFC. Our results show that learning-based placebo effect and cognition-based reappraisal have common anxiety-relieving effects .

23118193|Moreover , we found an inverse correlation between plasma oxytocin and the volume of the right amygdala and the right hippocampus , 2 brain areas implicated in fear and anxiety .

23112851|Surface morphology of amygdala is associated with trait anxiety . .

23112851|Previous neuroimaging studies have suggested a role of amygdala in trait anxiety level , in which amygdala was typically treated as a whole .

23112851|To date , it remains unknown whether the morphology of specific subregions of amygdala are associated with trait anxiety .

23112851|Here , we employed a shape analysis approach to locate the association between its morphology and trait anxiety on the surface of amygdala .

23112851|Statistical analysis revealed significant correlations between the two surface metrics and trait anxiety levels , which were located around the lateral and central nucleus of right amygdala .

23112851|Our results provided localized information for the association between amygdala and trait anxiety , and suggested a central role of the lateral and central nucleus of right amygdala on trait anxiety .

23103692|The T allele of rs324981 , which goes along with enhanced receptor function , was associated with panic disorder , increased anxiety sensitivity in healthy subjects , attenuated prefrontal brain activation and elevated amygdala responses to fear-relevant stimuli .

23085341|a decrease in the volume of left uncinate fasciculus -LRB- fiber connecting anterior temporal areas including the amygdala with prefrontal - / orbitofrontal cortices -RRB- and an increase in the volume of the left amygdala and right hippocampus , to be associated with trait anxiety .

23071554|Collectively , these data indicate that the amygdala is a valid target brain area for ghrelin where its neurobiological effects are important for food intake and for the suppression of emotional -LRB- anxiety-like -RRB- behaviors if food is not available .

23071305|Results support a maladaptive neurodevelopmental hypothesis linking decreased amygdala neuroplasticity to early-life dispositional anxiety .

23071305|These data suggest that altered amygdala neuroplasticity may play a role the early dispositional risk to develop anxiety and depression .

23068306|More specifically , reduced connectivity between the left amygdala and ACC may impair extinction of the amygdala response to anxiety-eliciting stimuli .

23059050|In contrast to placebo , alprazolam abolished the activation of the rACC after challenge with CCK-4 -LRB- p < .005 , corrected for multiple comparisons -RRB- and increased functional connectivity between the rACC and other anxiety-related brain regions such as amygdala and prefrontal cortex .

23043971|The effects of CCK -LRB- A -RRB- and CCK -LRB- B -RRB- receptor antagonists -LRB- devazepide and CI-988 , respectively -RRB- were examined using mouse anxiety tests -LRB- elevated-plus maze and light-dark box -RRB- and also by examining neuronal activities through EEG monitoring and c-Fos immunohistochemistry in the cortex and amygdala .

23036373|The amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- are crucial brain structures for anxiety , and it is speculated that the serotonergic neural system in these structures has an important role in regulating anxiety .

23036373|In our previous study , we indicated that local injections of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor into the amygdala attenuated anxiety-related behaviors in conditioned fear in rats .

23036373|In the present study , we investigated the effects of serotonergic terminal lesions in the amygdala and in mPFC induced by local injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine -LRB- 5,7-DHT -RRB- , on anxiety-related behaviors in conditioned fear and the elevated plus-maze test in rats .

23034517|We hypothesized that healthy adolescents at increased genetic and environmental risk for developing mood disorders -LRB- depression and anxiety -RRB- would demonstrate increased amygdala reactivity to emotional stimuli compared to those with only one such risk factor or those with none .

23034517|In addition , we assessed the role of other variables hypothesized to influence amygdala reactivity , namely recent negative life-events -LRB- RNLE -RRB- assessed at ages 14 and 17 , current anxiety symptoms and psychiatric history .

23026540|AAS-treated hamsters showed long-term reductions in 5HT innervation within several areas of the hamster brain implicated in anxiety , most notably the anterior hypothalamus and the central and medial amygdala .

23019518|GM-CSF ablation caused various hippocampus and amygdala-dependent deficits in spatial and fear memory while rendering intact basic parameters like motor function , inherent anxiety , and pain threshold levels .

23001314|The effect of stress and anxiety on the use of multiple memory systems in rats depends on the functional integrity of the basolateral amygdala .

22986165|These results indicate a short distance and a rapid extrasynaptic form of dopamine volume transmission mediated via D -LRB- 1 -RRB- receptors in the AIC and PIC which may enhance fear and anxiety by suppressing feed-forward inhibition in the basolateral and central amygdaloid nuclei .

22982568|Further , presynaptic regulation of lateral/basolateral amygdala thalamic inputs by chronic ethanol may be a novel neurobiological mechanism contributing to the increased anxiety-like behaviors that characterize withdrawal .

22959963|Nicotine-induced anxiety-like behavior in a rat model of the novelty-seeking phenotype is associated with long-lasting neuropeptidergic and neuroplastic adaptations in the amygdala : effects of the cannabinoid receptor 1 antagonist AM251 . .

22959963|Furthermore , treatment with the cannabinoid receptor 1 antagonist , AM251 -LRB- 5 mg/kg -RRB- during a short -LRB- 1 wk -RRB- abstinence is ineffective in reversing nicotine-induced anxiety , fluctuations in BDNF and spinophilin mRNAs , and the neuropeptidergic dysregulations in the amygdala ; although this treatment is effective in reversing the expression of locomotor sensitization to challenge nicotine even after a long abstinence .

22959963|Interestingly , the identical AM251 treatment administered during the late phase of a long abstinence further augments anxiety and associated changes in BDNF and spinophilin mRNA in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala in nicotine pre-exposed HRs .

22918570|Functional imaging , biochemical analysis , and lesion studies with humans have identified the HPA axis and the amygdala as key neuroanatomical regions driving both fear and anxiety .

22917679|In HCs , but not in patients , activation of amygdala and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- sgACC -RRB- was inversely correlated with activation of anterior mid cingulate cortex -LRB- aMCC -RRB- , and state anxiety covaried directly with activity in limbic and right frontotemporal cortices , but indirectly with activity in the left frontotemporal cortex .

22917617|Here we interrogated the role of BDNF in serotonergic neurotransmission in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , a limbic brain region associated with the neurobiology of anxiety .

22868060|In this way , we were interested in studying the effects of Ang - -LRB- 1-7 -RRB- intracerebroventricular administration on anxiety levels , as studied through some main behavioral parameters in the elevated plus maze , as well as the importance of Ang - -LRB- 1-7 -RRB- in the oxidative stress status from the amygdala , which is one of the key brain regions involved in mediating anxiety .

22866182|Using a psychophysiological interaction analysis , we further demonstrated amplified functional connectivity between the piriform cortex and emotion-related regions -LRB- amygdala and hippocampus -RRB- in response to negative odor , particularly in anxiety .

22849384|Exposure to predator odor and resulting anxiety enhances the expression of the ?2 ? subunit of voltage-sensitive calcium channels in the amygdala . .

22849384|Here , we examined the expression of the ?2 ?-1 subunit in the amygdala , hippocampus , and frontal cortex in the trimethyltiazoline -LRB- TMT -RRB- mouse model of innate anxiety .

22848607|This mechanism might crucially depend on amygdala functioning and it is potentially impaired in a number of clinical conditions such as autism or social anxiety disorders .

22841539|The pathway between central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray -LRB- vlPAG -RRB- is implicated in several disorders , including pain and anxiety .

22841539|The ability of gabapentin to suppress this pathway may be important for its anticonvulsant effects in AGS-kindled GEPR-9s , and this effect may contribute to gabapentin 's effectiveness in anxiety and pain in which the amygdala to PAG pathway is also implicated .

22832959|These findings provide the first direct evidence in humans in support of an inhibitory function of the BLA on the brain 's threat vigilance system , which has important implications for the understanding of the amygdala 's role in the disorders of fear and anxiety .

22828748|We find that tianeptine prevents two important functional consequences of chronic stress-induced plasticity in the amygdala -- dendritic growth and enhanced anxiety-like behavior .

22826810|This review presents data supporting the potential therapeutic role of DBS of the amygdala in the treatment of anxiety disorders , addiction , and mood disorders .

22814368|While anxiety is related to amygdala function , prior studies on amygdala reactivity both in healthy controls and women with PMDD are inconsistent with respect to menstrual cycle effects .

22814368|In addition , women with PMDD and high scores on trait anxiety had increased right amygdala reactivity in the luteal as compared to the follicular phase .

22814368|Thus , while the study failed to indicate increased luteal phase amygdala reactivity in women with PMDD , our findings suggest that anxiety proneness and progesterone levels modulate menstrual cycle related amygdala reactivity in women with PMDD .

22814115|The amygdala is not only a critical site for the generation of anxiety and fear , but is involved in the affective processing of sensory information including nociception .

22814115|Previously , we demonstrated that the stress hormone corticosterone -LRB- CORT -RRB- localized to the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- induces anxiety-like behavior and increases the sensitivity to visceral or somatic stimuli in rats .

22813977|Evidence suggests that the lateral septum -LRB- LS -RRB- and the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- play opposing roles in the modulation of fear and anxiety .

22811676|The aim of our present study was to determine whether acute treatment with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug minocycline -LRB- Minocin -LRB-  -RRB- -RRB- can mitigate the neurobehavioral abnormalities associated with mbTBI , Furthermore , we aimed to assess the effects of the treatment on select inflammatory , vascular , neuronal , and glial markers in sera and in brain regions associated with anxiety and memory -LRB- amygdala , prefrontal cortex , ventral , and dorsal hippocampus -RRB- following the termination -LRB- 51 days post-injury -RRB- of the experiment .

22796081|In the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , which plays a central role in anxiety as well as in seizure generation , GluK1Rs modulate GABAergic inhibition via postsynaptic and presynaptic mechanisms .

22782542|In functional magnetic resonance imaging studies , anticipation of fearful/threatening images has been shown to robustly activate the insular cortex and amygdala in healthy subjects , in subjects with high trait anxiety , and in some with anxiety disorders .

22776900|Disruption of fatty acid amide hydrolase activity prevents the effects of chronic stress on anxiety and amygdalar microstructure . .

22776900|Hyperactivation of the amygdala following chronic stress is believed to be one of the primary mechanisms underlying the increased propensity for anxiety-like behaviors and pathological states ; however , the mechanisms by which chronic stress modulates amygdalar function are not well characterized .

22776900|Chronic restraint stress also increased dendritic arborization , complexity and spine density of pyramidal neurons in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and increased anxiety-like behavior in wild-type mice .

22776900|These data support the hypothesis that inhibition of FAAH has therapeutic potential in the treatment of anxiety disorders , possibly by maintaining normal amygdalar function in the face of chronic stress .

22772356|H1-histamine receptors in the amygdala are involved in emotional memory but do not mediate anxiety-related behaviors in mice submitted to EPM testing . .

22772356|Taken together , these results suggest that the H -LRB- 1 -RRB- receptors in the amygdala are not implicated in anxiety-like behaviors but are involved in emotional states induced by the T1/T2 EPM protocol in mice .

22770651|Conjoint activity of the insula and amygdala has frequently been reported during emotional stimulation in general and in anxiety-related contexts in particular .

22770651|Specific measures of connectivity between subregions of the insula and amygdala were related to subjects ' anxiety levels .

22770651|Resting-state functional connectivity between the anterior insula and the basolateral amygdala was strongly related to state anxiety , explaining 40 % of behavioral variance across subjects .

22770651|This was substantiated by applying tractography , yielding a relationship between trait anxiety and axial diffusivity for a direct pathway between anterior insula and basolateral amygdala .

22770651|Our results indicate that anterior insula and basolateral amygdala constitute a network part that is prominently linked to anxiety .

22763169|Immediate anticipatory responses were observed in regions associated with threat detection and early processing of predictive cues , including the orbitofrontal cortex and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex , as well as the amygdala for individuals with elevated anxiety symptoms .

22760093|To investigate the relationship between alterations in anxiety-like behavior and changes in the dopaminergic system in the brain induced by BPA , we examined the effects of BPA on anxiety-like behavior using an open field test in juvenile and adult mice and measured DA and DOPAC levels and the DOPAC/DA ratio in the dorsal hippocampus -LRB- HIP -RRB- , amygdala -LRB- AMY -RRB- , and medulla oblongata -LRB- MED -RRB- using high-performance liquid chromatography -LRB- HPLC -RRB- in adult mice .

24009830|Enhancement of Anxiety and Modulation of TH and pERK Expressions in Amygdala by Repeated Injections of Corticosterone . .

24009830|Collectively , this study suggests that corticosterone has a major role in the induction of anxiety and the modulation of TH expression , at least , in the amygdala .

22723702|GABAergic inhibition in the amygdala is essential in regulating fear and anxiety .

22719923|Cell number alterations in the amygdaloid complex -LRB- AC -RRB- might coincide with neurological and psychiatric pathologies with anxiety imbalances as well as with changes in brain functionality during aging .

22719898|The data suggest a possible biological basis for amygdalar involvement , for increased anxiety , and for the paradox of increased approach but poor social relationships in WS .

22707231|CSDS induced anhedonia , helplessness , hyperactivity , anxiety , social avoidance , and freezing , as well as downregulation of VGLUT1 mRNA in the amygdala .

22692647|Herein , a ` fear network ' was suggested to mediate fear - and anxiety-related responses : panic attacks result from a dysfunctional coordination of ` upstream ' -LRB- cortical -RRB- and ` downstream ' -LRB- brainstem -RRB- sensory information leading to heightened amygdala activity with subsequent behavioral , autonomic and neuroendocrine activation .

22681774|mGluR ? ,5 activation improves network asynchrony and GABAergic synapse attenuation in the amygdala : implication for anxiety-like behavior in DBA/2 mice . .

22681774|Using behavioral task , two-photon cellular imaging and electrophysiology , we studied the characteristics of neural networks in basolateral amygdala and the influences of metabotropic glutamate receptor -LRB- mGluR -RRB- on their dynamics in DBA/2 mice showing anxiety-related genetic defects .

22681774|mGluR1 ,5 activation improves the anxiety-like behaviors of DBA/2 mice , synchronizes the activity of amygdala neurons and strengthens the transmission of GABAergic synapses .

22681774|The activity asynchrony of amygdala neurons and the weakness of GABA synaptic transmission are associated with anxiety-like behavior .

22659393|We also assessed effects of subclinical anxiety and depression on amygdala-prefrontal coupling during negative -LRB- versus neutral -RRB- word reading .

22659393|Both negative and positive words activated the amygdala , and negative-word processing revealed a positive correlation between amygdala activity and scores of trait anxiety and subclinical depression .

22659393|During negative versus neutral word reading , subjects with high trait anxiety also showed a stronger functional coupling between left amygdala and left DLPFC .

22633963|CB -LRB- 1 -RRB- receptors in the amygdala have been shown to mediate learned and unlearned anxiety states , however , the role of amygdalar TRPV1 receptors remains unclear .

22617357|The amygdala is a key structure in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders , and a putative target for anxiolytic treatments .

22617357|This study provides new insights into the brain dynamics underlying anxiety relief by demonstrating common amygdala targets for pharmacologically and psychologically induced anxiety reduction , and by showing that the amygdala is functionally heterogeneous in anxiolysis .

22616722|Knowing the mechanisms that control amygdala-perirhinal cortex interactions will allow better understanding of how emotionally charged visual events are remembered , and may help to understand how memories can consolidate and become intrusive in anxiety-related disorders .

22589251|Congenic knockout mice and mice overexpressing Sept5 in the hippocampus or amygdala were indistinguishable from control mice in novelty and olfactory responses , anxiety or motor activity .

22583860|Previous studies have found that adolescent social isolation of rats can lead to an increased anxiety state during adulthood , while chronic anxiety states are associated with dysregulated local GABAergic inhibition within the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BL -RRB- .

22579802|Increased levels of conditioned fear and avoidance behavior coincide with changes in phosphorylation of the protein kinase B -LRB- AKT -RRB- within the amygdala in a mouse model of extremes in trait anxiety . .

22575329|Functional MRI of the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis during conditions of uncertainty in generalized anxiety disorder . .

22575329|These two regions have been hypothesized to play different roles in stress and anxiety ; the amygdala is thought to regulate responses to brief emotional stimuli while the BNST is thought to be involved in more chronic regulation of sustained anxiety .

22554617|Pretreating rats with an orexin 1 receptor antagonist attenuated the FG-7142-induced anxiety-like behaviors , increased heart rate , and neuronal activation in key panic pathways , including subregions of the central nucleus of the amygdala , bed nucleus of the stria terminalis , periaqueductal gray and in the rostroventrolateral medulla .

22542673|In the current investigation , we evaluated the influence of stressor exposure applied during the juvenile period -LRB- 26-28 days of age -RRB- on anxiety-related behavior , plasma corticosterone and on GABA -LRB- A -RRB- ?2 , ?3 , ?5 and ?2 mRNA expression within the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- and amygdala measured during adulthood .

22529354|The prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- , amygdala , and dorsal raphe are known to be involved in anxiety disorders .

22529354|Inhibitory input from the PFC to the amygdala controls fear and anxiety typically originating in the amygdala , and disruption of the inhibitory input from the PFC leads to anxiety , fear , and personality changes .

22527118|Pharmacobehavioral studies in experimental animals , and imaging studies in humans , indicate that serotonergic transmission in the amygdala plays a key role in emotional processing , especially for anxiety-related stimuli .

22516107|The intercalated paracapsular islands as a module for integration of signals regulating anxiety in the amygdala . .

22516107|Current experimental evidence will be discussed suggesting that through feedforward inhibitory effects on specific amygdaloid nuclei IPC neurons participate in the maintenance of basal anxiety as well as in the modulation of unconditioned and conditioned fear , and in the process of fear extinction .

22514524|The lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is a key element in the neural circuit subserving Pavlovian fear-conditioning , an animal model of fear and anxiety .

22511362|These results highlight that fear circuitry could be dysregulated in chronic , pervasive anxiety , and preliminary functional neuroimaging findings suggest that deficient amygdala recruitment could underlie attenuated reflex responding .

22510359|It is suggested that polymorphic variation at the oxytocin receptor gene -LRB- rs2254298 -RRB- is associated with sociability , amygdala volume and differential risk for psychiatric conditions including autism , depression and anxiety disorder , depending on the quality of early environmental experiences .

22502990|Although the contributions of the medial PFC , amygdala , and hippocampus to fear and anxiety have been studied extensively with animal models , the selective roles of the ventral PFC-including the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- vlPFC -RRB- and orbitofrontal cortex-are poorly understood .

22498103|Dysfunction of limbic structures , such as the medial prefrontal cortex , amygdala and hippocampus , is associated with the symptoms of anxiety disorders .

22487247|The amygdala is fundamental in expression of emotion , and is hyperactive in many patients with mood or anxiety disorders .

22487047|Any linkage would have implications for understanding why one signal dominates learning in some situations and not others , and also for appreciating the potential impact on learning of neuropathological conditions involving altered DA or amygdalar function , such as schizophrenia , addiction or anxiety disorders .

22470326|Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- studies indicate agents used to treat anxiety , e.g. , SSRIs and benzodiazepines , attenuate amygdala , insula , and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- activation during emotional processing .

22465841|The extended amygdala is thought to play a critical role in adaptive motivational behavior and is implicated in the pathophysiology of maladaptive fear and anxiety .

22464182|Central administration of thyrotropin releasing hormone -LRB- TRH -RRB- reduces anxiety ; amygdalar TRH expression is inversely proportional to the anxious behavior displayed in the elevated plus maze performed during the dark phase -LRB- EPM-D -RRB- .

22459044|Here we show that OT induced the expression of regulator of G-protein signaling 2 -LRB- RGS2 -RRB- , a regulatory factor for anxiety , in the central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- of female mice .

22450197|The greater left amygdala response to negative emotion for women accords with previous reports that women respond more strongly to negative emotional stimuli , as well as with hypothesized links between increased neurobiological reactivity to negative emotion and increased prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders in women .

22442074|Moreover , BDNF -LRB- + / Met -RRB- mice exhibited more prominent changes in BDNF levels and apical dendritic spine density in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala after stress , which correlated with the impaired working memory and elevated anxiety-like behaviors .

22437483|Finally , we will address the current knowledge on the neural and pharmacological mechanisms underlying 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalization , which show a substantial overlap with mechanisms known from other research on fear and anxiety , such as those involving the periaqueductal gray or the amygdala .

22435644|We found that LFPI produced anxiety-like freezing behavior accompanied by increased reactive gliosis -LRB- reflecting neuroimmune inflammatory responses -RRB- in key brain structures associated with anxiety : the amygdala , insula , and hippocampus .

22434239|In a functional MRI study on 7 - to 9-year-old children , we showed that math anxiety was associated with hyperactivity in right amygdala regions that are important for processing negative emotions .

22373717|In a patient with negative MRI findings , intracranial EEG recordings documented a strict correlation between habitual ictal anxiety attacks and both spontaneous and stimulation-induced epileptic activity in a right occipital epileptogenic area with subsequent spreading to the symptomatogenic zone in the amygdala .

22364507|In low-anxiety rats , we have demonstrated that the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- regulates colonic hypersensitivity and anxiety induced by selective activation of either glucocorticoid receptors -LRB- GR -RRB- or mineralocorticoid receptors -LRB- MR -RRB- , which is also mediated by the corticotropin releasing factor -LRB- CRF -RRB- Type-1 receptor .

22347484|Adolescent binge drinking leads to changes in alcohol drinking , anxiety , and amygdalar corticotropin releasing factor cells in adulthood in male rats . .

22342800|The rAAV-Y5 vector injected into the hippocampus and amygdala induced a pronounced and sustained increase in Y5 receptor mRNA expression and functional Y5 receptor binding , but no significant effects were found with regard to anxiety - and depression-like behaviours or seizure susceptibility .

22308258|In humans , amygdala activation has been consistently reported in anxiety disorders , indicating that hyperactivation of the amygdala is involved in the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders .

22308258|From animal studies , the mechanism underlying the anxiolytic effect of SSRIs is hypothesized as follows : SSRIs inhibit the neuronal activities of the amygdala , and this inhibition decreases the level of fear and anxiety .

22298122|The amygdala is critical for transforming such stressful events into anxiety , and the recently discovered neuropeptide S transmitter system represents a promising candidate apt to control these interactions .

22298122|-LRB- 1 -RRB- IS increased anxiety-like behavior , and enhanced conditioned fear responses during extinction 10 days after stress , -LRB- 2 -RRB- neuropeptide S in the amygdala prevented , while an antagonist aggravated , these stress-induced changes of aversive behaviors , -LRB- 3 -RRB- excitatory synaptic activity in LA projection neurons was increased on fear conditioning and returned to pre-conditioning values on fear extinction , and -LRB- 4 -RRB- stress resulted in sustained high levels of excitatory synaptic activity during fear extinction , whereas neuropeptide S supported the return of synaptic activity during fear extinction to levels typical of non-stressed animals .

22298122|Together these results suggest that the neuropeptide S system is capable of interfering with mechanisms in the amygdala that transform stressful events into anxiety and impaired fear extinction .

22297173|The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of post-weaning social isolation on subsequent responses of an anxiety-related dorsal raphe nucleus -LRB- DR -RRB- - basolateral amygdala system to pharmacological challenge with the anxiogenic drug , N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide -LRB- FG-7142 ; a partial inverse agonist at the benzodiazepine allosteric site on the ?-aminobutyric acid -LRB- GABA -RRB- -LRB- A -RRB- receptor -RRB- .

22252103|The increased CRF levels in the amygdala may , at least in part , contribute to the footshock-induced reinstatement of METH-seeking behavior and the increase in anxiety-like behavior .

22250290|Whereas the amygdala and midbrain showed only transient responses , the ventral basal forebrain and anterior insula showed sustained activity during extended emotional contexts that tracked positively with task-evoked anxiety .

22232580|Next we investigated the potential neural substrates underlying the acute anxiogenic effects by analyzing the morphological and physiological impact of acute fluoxetine treatment on principal neurons of the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , a brain area that plays a pivotal role in fear and anxiety .

22210508|Substance P by acting on its preferred receptor neurokinin 1 -LRB- NK1 -RRB- in the amygdala appears to be critically involved in the modulation of fear and anxiety .

22210508|Our data add to previous localization studies by describing an unexpected variation between LA and basal nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BA -RRB- in the neurochemical phenotype of NK1-expressing neurons and reveal the relative source of glutamatergic inputs that may activate these neurons , which in turn regulate fear and anxiety responses .

22206877|During negative encoding , increased insular activation was observed in both depressed groups -LRB- MDD and MDD + anxiety -RRB- , whereas increased amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex activation during positive word encoding were observed as depressive state-dependent effects in MDD only .

22198970|Further , significant CS -LRB- + -RRB- / CS -LRB- - -RRB- differentiation in the left amygdala was found during extinction and was associated with lower scores in social anxiety .

22076860|Because models of pathological anxiety posit altered frontolimbic interactions , the uncinate fasciculus -LRB- UF -RRB- connecting -LRB- orbito - -RRB- frontal and temporal areas including the amygdala is of particular interest .

22076860|Reduced volume of the left UF in SAD fits well into pathophysiological models of anxiety , as it suggests deficient structural connectivity between higher-level control areas in the orbitofrontal cortex and more basal limbic areas like the amygdala .

21920442|Using a robust multiple regression approach , we examined the effects of social anxiety , anxiety sensitivity , and trait anxiety -LRB- which overlapped with depressive symptoms , and can therefore be considered a measure of negative affectivity -RRB- on activation in insula , amygdala , and medial prefrontal cortex , in response to emotional faces .

21920442|Adjusting for negative affectivity and anxiety sensitivity , social anxiety was associated with activity in left amygdala , right insula , and subgenual anterior cingulate across all emotional faces .

21465671|Arousal-related inputs are known to prime amygdaloid mechanisms for fear and anxiety , with resultant social avoidance .

21458543|Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry we now investigated changes in the expression of GABA synthesizing enzymes -LRB- GAD65 and GAD67 -RRB- , GABA -LRB- A -RRB- -LRB- ?1-5 , ?1-3 , ?1-2 -RRB- and GABA -LRB- B -RRB- receptor subunits -LRB- GBBR1 , GBBR2 -RRB- in amygdaloid nuclei of high anxiety-related behavior -LRB- HAB -RRB- mice in comparison to mice selected for normal anxiety-related behavior -LRB- NAB -RRB- .

21455683|Based on these observations , the Anxiety Suppressor Model has been proposed , which assumes that KF-1 Ub ligase may suppress the amygdala-mediated anxiety by degrading some anxiety promoting protein -LRB- s -RRB- , such as a neurotransmitter receptor , through the ER-associated degradation pathway in the frontal cortex and hippocampus .

21453753|AChE-R expression in the striatum and amygdala were positively correlated with anxiety in the EPM .

21437203|The neuropeptide S -LRB- NPS -RRB- receptor system modulates neuronal circuit activity in the amygdala in conjunction with fear , anxiety and the expression and extinction of previously acquired fear memories .

21421010|In conclusion , melatonin administration to amygdala decreased the anxiety ; however , spatial memory performance of the rats was impaired by the pinealectomy and melatonin administrations .

21420406|The C/C genotype was associated with greater anxiety symptoms in patients with IBS and controls and increased activation of the amygdala under emotional and nonemotional conditions .

21420406|Regardless of diagnosis , the C/C genotype of the c.-42C > T polymorphism in HTR3A , compared with T carrier status , is associated with increased anxiety and amygdala responsiveness during emotional and nonemotional tasks .

21414464|Specifically , we examine the modulatory effects of the aspects of neuroticism -LRB- volatility/withdrawal -RRB- , a personality variable that has been linked to both generalized anxiety and differences in amygdala sensitivity .

21414332|The effects on attentional bias are largest in those participants reporting higher state anxiety scores , possibly because underlying amygdala activation is highest .

21411044|In vivo , TCAP-1 blocks stress-induced c-Fos in the hippocampus and amygdala , and modulates stress-induced anxiety-like behaviors .

21411044|These results suggest that TCAP-1 may be associated with anxiety-like behavior via regulation of dendritic morphology in the hippocampus , independent of amygdalar modification .

21409840|The decreased tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the locus coeruleus and the beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation in the amygdaloid complex might be involved in the inhibiton of the delayed augmentation of f-ASR by repeated antidepressant treatment , leading to the possibility that the delayed sensitization of CRH response to stress after CVS might contribute to the biological mechanism underlying the formation of pathological states such as anxiety and depressive disorders .

21396459|The amygdala plays an important role in emotional and social functions , and amygdala dysfunction has been associated with multiple neuropsychiatric disorders , including autism , anxiety , and depression .

21396387|The extended amygdala is critically implicated in mediating acute and chronic stress responsivity and anxiety-like behaviors .

21389985|Although it has been proposed that the amygdala , a brain region important for emotional processing , has a role in anxiety , the neural mechanisms that control anxiety remain unclear .

21377524|In support of this view , prior TNF? microinjection into the central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- of rats facilitated ethanol withdrawal-induced anxiety-a response that could not be attributed to an increase in plasma corticosterone .

21376086|After extinction , neuronal activation was visualized by c-Fos for overall activity and parvalbumin immunoreactivity for gamma-aminobutyric acid -LRB- GABA -RRB- neuron in brain areas linked to anxiety -LRB- medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala -RRB- .

21376086|Deficits in avoidance extinction secondary to lower GABAergic activation in baslolateral amygdala may contribute to anxiety vulnerability in this animal model of inhibited temperament .

21356318|Reduced resting-state functional connectivity between amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex in social anxiety disorder . .

21356318|Although the amygdala has a central role in perception and processing of threatening cues , little is known about the involved networks and corresponding dysfunctions in social anxiety .

21356318|Therefore , this study aims to investigate the functional connectivity network of the amygdala in patients with social anxiety disorder and to identify regions that might influence amygdalar reactivity via modulatory pathways .

21356318|Our results suggest alterations within the amygdalar functional connectivity network in social anxiety disorder .

21356318|Combined with the amygdalar hyperactivation our findings corroborate the proposed dysfunction of the fronto-amygdalar inhibition in anxiety disorders and indicate a modulatory influence of the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices on threat perception and processing .

21346811|We re-investigated a 53 year old woman with SPS and profound anxiety for GABA-A receptor binding in the amygdala with -LRB- 11 -RRB- C-flumazenil PET scan and studied the potential pathogenic role of purified IgG from her plasma filtrates containing high-titer antibodies against GAD 65 .

21319894|Fear and anxiety behaviors are underpinned by neuronal changes within the amygdala .

21315265|These two dimensions may contribute to symptomatology differences across anxiety disorders ; the amygdala mechanism affecting the development of phobic fear and the frontal mechanism influencing the maintenance of both specific fears and generalized anxiety .

21309108|Clinical and experimental data have correlated changes in the structure/function of the amygdala with emotional disorders such as anxiety .

21309108|In this chapter we review the neuroendocrinology of the stress response , focusing on the role of the limbic system in its establishment and supplementing that information with new experimental data that demonstrates the relationship between stress and anxiety disorders ; we also discuss the structural changes that occur in the amygdala after stress .

21306450|Two hours after acute stress of exposure to the elevated plus maze in which heightened anxiety was manifested , increases were seen only in the amygdala of females in CRH and CRHR1 signalling , whereas CRHR2 mRNA was reduced in both sexes .

21289190|Intra-BNST , but not dorsal , CGRP infusions also increased c-Fos immunoreactivity in a number of anxiety-related brain areas -LRB- central nucleus of the amygdala , locus ceruleus , ventrolateral septal nucleus , paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus , lateral hypothalamus , lateral parabrachial nucleus , dorsal raphe nucleus , and nucleus accumbens shell -RRB- , all of which receive direct projections from the BNST .

21276772|This raises the possibility that CIS-induced manifestations of the anxiety may be associated with synchronized theta oscillations in the hippocampus and amygdala .

21270771|Dopamine D3-like receptors modulate anxiety-like behavior and regulate GABAergic transmission in the rat lateral/basolateral amygdala . .

21264642|Enhanced amygdala sensitivity coupled with weak inhibitory control from the dACC may form a neural circuit mediating behaviors characteristic of inhibited temperament and risk for anxiety disorders .

21263035|In the current study , we examined both anxiety-like behavior and dendritic complexity within the prefrontal cortex and basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- in wild-type and CB -LRB- 1 -RRB- receptor-deficient mice , under basal conditions and following exposure to 21 days of protracted restraint stress .

21256233|The psychophysiological expression of generalized fear correlated with amygdala activity , and connectivity between the amygdala and extrastriate visual cortex was correlated with individual differences in trait anxiety .

21248140|Recent research suggests that stress and anxiety shift the balance of attention away from a task-directed mode , governed by prefrontal cortex , to a sensory-vigilance mode , governed by the amygdala and other threat-sensitive regions .

21215728|Recent work has concentrated on specific anxiety-provoking stimuli ; focusing on arousal - or fear-related brain areas such as the amygdala .

21215728|Activations in the amygdala and in occipital regions correlated with trait anxiety and social anxiety measures .

21209156|Changes in lateral/basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- neurotransmission could directly influence anxiety-like behaviors after chronic ethanol exposure and withdrawal .

21203551|Altered effective connectivity network of the amygdala in social anxiety disorder : a resting-state FMRI study . .

21203551|The amygdala is often found to be abnormally recruited in social anxiety disorder -LRB- SAD -RRB- patients .

21195134|These findings implicate dysregulations in the NPY-CRF systems in the HR hippocampus and amygdala associated with the emergence of social anxiety-like behavior , and a novel Y2R-mediated pathway in nicotine relapse .

22832404|Gene expression changes in key brain regions for anxiety -LRB- prefrontal cortex , amygdala and hippocampus -RRB- and blood were analyzed using a convergent functional genomics -LRB- CFG -RRB- approach , which integrates our new data with published human and animal model data , as a translational strategy of cross-matching and prioritizing findings .

22738024|Here , we investigated the effects of attentional load on amygdala activation to threat-related stimuli in individuals suffering from an anxiety disorder .

21185265|Our results suggest that HCN channel activity can modulate the GABAergic synaptic transmission in the BLA , which in turn control the amygdala-related emotional behaviors such as anxiety .

21183456|Interaction between trait anxiety and trait anger predict amygdala reactivity to angry facial expressions in men but not women . .

21183456|Here , we report the novel finding that individual differences in trait anger are positively correlated with bilateral dorsal amygdala reactivity to angry facial expressions , but only among men with elevated trait anxiety scores .

21182574|The role of amygdaloid brain-derived neurotrophic factor , activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein and dendritic spines in anxiety and alcoholism . .

21182574|It was found that in comparison with NP rats , P rats displayed innate anxiety-like behaviors , and had lower mRNA and protein levels of both BDNF and Arc , and also had lower DSD in the central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- and medial amygdala -LRB- MeA -RRB- , but not in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

21182574|These results suggest that innate deficits in BDNF-Arc levels , and DSD , in the CeA and MeA may be involved in the anxiety-like and excessive alcohol-drinking behaviors of P rats , as ethanol increased these amygdaloid synaptic markers and produced anxiolytic effects in P rats , but not NP rats .

21164371|The amygdaloid complex is involved in anxiety or fear responses to stressful stimuli .

21164371|In this study the effect of neuropeptide-EI on anxiety-like behavior and its influence on adrenocortical function was tested in male Wistar rats that were injected bilaterally in the basolateral amygdala with neuropeptide-EI -LRB- 1 ?g / 1 ?l -RRB- or artificial cerebrospinal fluid and placed on the plus maze .

21159967|Stress and anxiety-related behaviors controlled by the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- are regulated in vivo by neuropeptide Y -LRB- NPY -RRB- and corticotrophin-releasing factor -LRB- CRF -RRB- : NPY produces anxiolytic effects , whereas CRF produces anxiogenic effects .

21148026|The role of the amygdala in the mediation of fear and anxiety has been extensively investigated .

21148026|However , how the amygdala functions during the organization of the anxiety-like behaviors generated in the elevated plus maze -LRB- EPM -RRB- is still under investigation .

21130225|Prenatal interaction produced anxiety , depression-like responses , and altered social behavior that were accompanied by decreased reactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis , attenuated serotonin neurotransmission in the hippocampus , reduced enlargement of lateral ventricles , decreased volumes of amygdala and periaqueductal gray matter and density of spines on dendrites of granule cells of the hippocampus .

21130145|Within the brain , the amygdala is an important area involved in processing emotional responses such as anxiety .

21130145|The aim of the present study was to assess whether the NO system in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- influences histamine-induced anxiety-like behavior in rats .

21127016|While numerous task-based neuroimaging studies show that anxiety levels predict amygdala-mPFC connectivity and response magnitude , here we tested the hypothesis that anxiety would predict functional connectivity between these brain regions even during rest .

21127016|At rest , individuals with high anxiety were characterized by negatively correlated amygdala-ventral mPFC functional connectivity , while low anxious subjects showed positively correlated activity .

21127016|These data show that amygdala-mPFC connectivity at rest indexes normal individual differences in anxiety .

21118530|NMDAR2B tyrosine phosphorylation regulates anxiety-like behavior and CRF expression in the amygdala . .

21118530|Expression of corticotropin-releasing factor -LRB- CRF -RRB- , which is important for the regulation of anxiety-like behavior , is increased in the amygdala of the knock-in mice .

21118530|These data suggest that Tyr-1472 phosphorylation on GluN2B is important for anxiety-like behavior by negative regulation of CRF expression in the amygdala .

21093544|Local repeated corticotropin-releasing factor infusion exacerbates anxiety - and fear-related behavior : differential involvement of the basolateral amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex . .

21093544|CRF signaling in both the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- has been implicated in anxiety-like behavior .

21093462|Recent interest in the amygdala arises from its role in processing fear and the relationship of fear to human anxiety .

21076868|This study investigated the induction of anxiety , changes of TH and pERK expression in cortex and amygdala after stress .

21076868|Also it was determined the changes of glucocorticoid and anxiety when the rats were given stress after amygdala lesion .

21076868|In conclusion , the results of this study indicate that the lesion of amygdala suppressed the stress-induced anxiety and elevation of glucocorticoid in serum .

21076868|These results suggest that the elevation of So-1-P might be involved in induction of anxiety during stress by the modulation of dopaminergic system in amygdala .

21074570|Recently , cross-talking relationships between these two specific neuroreceptor systems of the central-cortical amygdalar complex has been considered an important element for anxiety type of behaviors .

21054349|The experimental strategy was composed of the following steps : -LRB- 1 -RRB- use of the mouse pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy -LRB- TLE -RRB- ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- behavioral analyses of anxiety states in the elevated plus maze test , light-dark avoidance test , and Pavlovian fear conditioning ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- probing neurophysiologic activity patterns in amygdala-hippocampal circuits in freely behaving mice .

21048893|Norepinephrine -LRB- NE -RRB- is thought to play a key role in fear and anxiety , but its role in amygdala-dependent Pavlovian fear conditioning , a major model for understanding the neural basis of fear , is poorly understood .

20980994|The cannabinoid receptor type 1 -LRB- CB1 -RRB- and the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- are both known to have crucial roles in the processing of fear and anxiety , whereby they appear to be especially involved in the control of fear states .

20971127|In male mice , four weeks of social isolation induces behavioral dysfunctions such as aggression , fear , and anxiety-like behavior associated with a decrease in allopregnanolone biosynthesis in selected corticolimbic structures comprising the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , olfactory bulb , hippocampus , and medial prefrontal cortex .

20955808|The functional role of the dopaminergic pathway connecting the VTA to the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- in fear and anxiety has received little attention .

20955808|These findings indicate that the dopamine D -LRB- 2 -RRB- receptor pathway connecting the ventral tegmental area and the basolateral amygdala modulates fear and anxiety and may be a novel pharmacological target for the treatment of anxiety .

20950644|Fear conditioning with its neurological basis in the amygdala and associated structures provides an important model of anxiety disorders .

20950644|However , this review will argue for a distinction between fear-provoking immediate and anxiety-provoking potential threats , with the amygdala processing immediate threats and the cingulate cortex -LRB- and insular -RRB- processing potential threats .

20950634|Given that many neurodevelopmental disorders involve too little or too much anxiety or too little of too much social interaction , it is not surprising that the amygdala has been implicated in many of them .

20950517|The results suggest that the frontal cortex and amygdala undergo structural remodelling induced by the stress of maternal separation and isolation , which alters behavioural and physiological responses in adulthood , including anxiety , memory and other cognitive processes .

20888872|Previous functional neuroimaging studies found that the amygdala and other limbic regions may play a substantial role in social anxiety disorder -LRB- SAD -RRB- .

20863864|Neuropeptide Y conjugated to saporin alters anxiety-like behavior when injected into the central nucleus of the amygdala or basomedial hypothalamus in BALB/cJ mice . .

20855365|CSD induces freezing behaviour by invoking anxiety/fear via amygdala activation in freely-moving rats .

20855050|Although clinical studies have demonstrated smaller subcortical volumes in structures such as the amygdala , hippocampus , caudate nucleus , and thalamus in adults and adolescents with depressive disorders and anxiety , no study has assessed such structures in babies , long before the development of the disorders .

20850460|Activation of 5-HT2C receptors in limbic structures such as the amygdala and hippocampus increases anxiety .

20833435|Potentiation of fear-related defense behaviours coordinated by the amygdala in response to environmental threat characterizes several anxiety disorders .

20833253|This finding supports data on the role of GABA-A receptor alpha-2 subunits in the amygdala in modulation of anxiety-like behaviour .

20813118|Perceived social support moderates the link between threat-related amygdala reactivity and trait anxiety . .

20813118|Here we report that the expression of trait anxiety as a function of threat-related amygdala reactivity is moderated by perceived social support , a resource for coping with adversity .

20813118|A significant positive correlation between amygdala reactivity and trait anxiety was evident in individuals reporting below average levels of support but not in those reporting average or above average levels .

20813118|Our findings illuminate a biological pathway , namely moderation of amygdala-related anxiety , through which social support may confer resilience to psychopathology .

20807585|The effects of midazolam and D-cycloserine on the release of glutamate and GABA in the basolateral amygdala of low and high anxiety rats during extinction trial of a conditioned fear test . .

20731637|A single dose of nicotine acted as a stressor in non-smokers , leading to increased anxiety and neural activation elicited by unpleasant stimuli as well as altered connectivity within the amygdala-pACC circuit .

20730419|A role for delta opioid receptors in the central nucleus of the amygdala in anxiety-like behaviors . .

20730419|DOR mRNA and protein are expressed in the central nucleus of the amygdala , a region that plays an important role in processing fear , stress , and anxiety .

20730419|The present study investigated the role of DOR in the central amygdala in anxiety-like behaviors .

20730419|The selective DOR agonist -LSB- D-Pen 2,5 -RSB- - enkephalin -LRB- DPDPE -RRB- or antagonist naltrindole was bilaterally microinjected into the central nucleus of the amygdala of adult male Sprague Dawley rats and anxiety-like behaviors were assessed using the elevated plus maze .

20730419|Rats injected with DPDPE into the central nucleus of the amygdala demonstrated less anxiety-like behavior , as evidenced by significantly greater number of open-arm entries and time spent in the open arms than controls .

20730419|These findings provide direct evidence that activation of DOR in the central amygdala reduces anxiety-like behavior and suggest that DOR in this area are important for regulating anxious states .

20720535|Oxytocin attenuates amygdala reactivity to fear in generalized social anxiety disorder . .

20720535|Patients with generalized social anxiety disorder -LRB- GSAD -RRB- exhibit heightened activation of the amygdala in response to social cues conveying threat -LRB- eg , fearful/angry faces -RRB- .

20720535|The neuropeptide oxytocin -LRB- OXT -RRB- decreases anxiety and stress , facilitates social encounters , and attenuates amygdala reactivity to threatening faces in healthy subjects .

20720535|These findings suggest that OXT has a specific effect on fear-related amygdala activity , particularly when the amygdala is hyperactive , such as in GSAD , thereby providing a brain-based mechanism of the impact of OXT in modulating the exaggerated processing of social signals of threat in patients with pathological anxiety .

20717721|Na + , K + ATPase activity is reduced in amygdala of rats with chronic stress-induced anxiety-like behavior . .

20717721|In this study , we examined the effects of two chronic stress regimens upon anxiety-like behavior , Na -LRB- + -RRB- , K -LRB- + -RRB- - ATPase activity and immunocontent , and oxidative stress parameters -LRB- antioxidant enzymes and reactive oxygen species production -RRB- in the amygdala .

20717721|We conclude that both models of chronic stress lead to anxiety-like behavior and decreased amygdalal Na -LRB- + -RRB- , K -LRB- + -RRB- - ATPase activity , which appears not to be related to oxidative imbalance .

20713712|In contrast , TLR3-deficient mice demonstrated impaired amygdala-related behavior and anxiety in the cued fear-conditioning , open field , and elevated plus maze tasks .

20689940|GABA -LRB- A -RRB- ? receptor mechanisms in the rat amygdala and its role in the modulation of fear and anxiety . .

20689940|This work was conducted to study whether GABA -LRB- A -RRB- ? receptors may have a putative role in the amygdaloid modulation of fear and anxiety .

20689940|It is suggested that GABA -LRB- A -RRB- ? receptors may have a role in the amygdaloid modulation of fear and anxiety .

20688136|Prenatal ethanol exposure attenuates GABAergic inhibition in basolateral amygdala leading to neuronal hyperexcitability and anxiety-like behavior of adult rat offspring . .

20688136|Previous studies have demonstrated that GABA system in the basolateral amygdala complex -LRB- BLA -RRB- is involved in the pathogensis of anxiety-related disorders .

20686132|However , depression and anxiety disorders involve multiple areas of the brain , such as the amygdala and prefrontal cortex , where neurogenesis does not appear to occur in the adult mammalian brain .

20667170|We employed functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure activation in the amygdala , ventromedial PFC -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- and ventrolateral PFC -LRB- vlPFC -RRB- during sad facial affect processing in family members with BD -LRB- n = 40 -RRB- , MDD and anxiety disorders -LRB- n = 22 -RRB- or no psychiatric diagnosis -LRB- n = 25 -RRB- and 50 healthy controls .

20666145|The amygdala is a brain structure that is critically involved in the processing of memory and emotion , including fear and anxiety .

20661452|The Interaction Between Gaze and Facial Expression in the Amygdala and Extended Amygdala is Modulated by Anxiety . .

20661452|Here , we investigated the way in which individual differences in anxiety would influence the interactive effect of gaze and expression on the response to angry and fearful faces in the human extended amygdala .

20661452|We found that state anxiety predicted an increased response in the dorsal amygdala/substantia innominata -LRB- SI -RRB- to angry faces when gazing at , relative to away from the observer .

20661452|In addition , the relationship between state anxiety and gaze on emotional intensity ratings mirrored the relationship between anxiety and the amygdala/SI response .

20655906|Corticotropin-releasing factor increases serotonin release in the central nucleus of the amygdala , and this neurochemical circuitry may play a role in mediating fear and anxiety states .

20655320|Association between amygdala response to emotional faces and social anxiety in autism spectrum disorders . .

20655320|Further , within the ASD group , greater social anxiety was associated with increased activation in right amygdala and left middle temporal gyrus , and decreased activation in the fusiform face area .

20647026|The basolateral amygdala is a nodal structure within a distributed and interconnected network that regulates anxiety states and anxiety-related behavior .

20647026|Together , these data suggest that the PV/5-HT -LRB- 2A -RRB- receptor expressing GABAergic interneurons in the basolateral amygdala are part of a DR-basolateral amygdala neuronal circuit modulating anxiety-states and anxiety-related behavior .

20602430|Exaggerated amygdala activation to threatening faces has been detected in adults and children with anxiety disorders , compared to healthy comparison -LRB- HC -RRB- subjects .

20602430|Like previous reports in adult OCD , pediatric OCD may have a distinct neural profile from other anxiety disorders , with respect to amygdala activation in response to emotional stimuli that are not disorder specific .

20600183|Specifically , we examine the modulatory effects of the aspects of neuroticism -LRB- volatility/withdrawal -RRB- , a personality variable that has been linked to both generalized anxiety and differences in amygdala sensitivity .

20599828|In particular , ERbeta-EGFP cells were found in autonomic brain regions -LRB- i.e. , hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus , rostral ventrolateral medulla and nucleus of the solitary tract -RRB- , in regions associated with anxiety and stress behaviors -LRB- i.e. , bed nucleus of the stria terminalis , amygdala , periaqueductal gray , raphe and parabrachial nuclei -RRB- and in regions involved in learning and memory processes -LRB- i.e. , basal forebrain , cerebral cortex and hippocampus -RRB- .

20573588|Elevated corticosterone in the amygdala leads to persistent increases in anxiety-like behavior and pain sensitivity . .

20573588|Corticosterone -LRB- CORT -RRB- localized to the amygdala induces anxiety-like behavior coupled with increased behavioral responses to visceral and somatic stimuli .

20573588|In the current study , we investigated the long-term consequences of briefly exposing the amygdala to elevated levels of CORT with the hypothesis that modulation of the amygdala with CORT results in persistent increases in anxiety-like behavior and viscerosomatic sensitivity .

20555311|Modafinil in low doses has a unique physiologic profile compared with stimulant drugs : it enhances the efficiency of prefrontal cortical cognitive information processing , while dampening reactivity to threatening stimuli in the amygdala , a brain region implicated in anxiety .

20550755|In this study we investigated whether individual differences in trait anxiety affect amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- dACC -RRB- activation during fear conditioning and extinction .

20550755|Activations of the amygdala and the dACC were examined with respect to the effects of trait anxiety .

20550755|This study reveals that high levels of trait anxiety are associated with both increased amygdala activation and reduced dACC recruitment during the extinction of conditioned fear .

20550755|This hyper-responsivity of the amygdala and the deficient cognitive control during the extinction of conditioned fear in anxious subjects reflect an increased resistance to extinct fear responses and may thereby enhance the vulnerability to developing anxiety disorders .

20548294|Therefore , the current study assessed the effects of prolonged and site-specific over-expression of CRF , which mimics the state of chronic production , in extended amygdala nuclei that are known to be involved in mediating anxiety-like states .

20541981|The amygdala and anxiety after epilepsy surgery . .

20541981|The relationship between amygdalar volume and anxiety after epilepsy surgery was explored .

20541981|Resection of an ipsilateral amygdala of normal volume , relative to controls , was associated with postoperative anxiety in patients with mesial temporal resections , regardless of seizure outcome -LSB- F -LRB- 1 , 22 -RRB- = 5.17 , P < 0.05 -RSB- .

20541981|There was no relationship between amygdalar volume and anxiety in patients with non-mesial temporal resections , or between contralateral amygdalar volume and anxiety in patients with mesial temporal resections -LRB- P > 0.05 for all comparisons -RRB- .

20541981|In conclusion , resection or deafferentation of an amygdala with a volume within the normal range was associated with increased postoperative anxiety .

20530587|Prodynorphin gene deletion increased anxiety-like behaviours , impaired the anxiolytic effect of bromazepam and altered GABAA receptor subunits gene expression in the amygdala . .

20528764|This action would result in less activation of the amygdala , medial PFC and insula by warning signals , as shown by the reviewed results obtained with functional neuroimaging in healthy volunteers and patients with anxiety disorders .

20472131|The amygdala has received considerable attention because of its established role in specific behaviors and disorders such as anxiety , depression , and autism .

20445054|The central and basolateral amygdala are critical sites of neuropeptide Y/Y2 receptor-mediated regulation of anxiety and depression . .

20445054|To identify the precise anatomical site -LRB- s -RRB- of Y2-mediated anxiogenic action , we investigated the effect of site-specific deletion of the Y2 gene in amygdaloid nuclei on anxiety and depression-related behaviors in mice .

20430103|Perhaps most importantly , the amygdala/insula activation observed suggests that threat-related responses can be maintained even when aversive events are consistently avoided , which may account for the persistence of avoidance-coping in childhood anxiety .

20415605|This is consistent with previous research indicating that the VLPFC may facilitate effective responding to underlying neural correlates of anxiety in other brain regions , such as the amygdala .

20410872|Exposure to stressful stimuli increases NE levels in brain regions that regulate stress and anxiety , like the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

20405238|Substantial evidence has implicated regions of the central extended amygdala , including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- and the central nucleus of the amygdala as critical structures mediating fear - and anxiety-like behavior in both humans and animals .

20381473|Expression of chimeric estrogen-glucocorticoid-receptor in the amygdala reduces anxiety . .

20381473|The basolateral amygdala is critical for generating anxiety , and exposure to glucocorticoids induces anxiety .

20381473|The demonstrated ability of glucocorticoids to cause dendritic expansion and increase excitability in the amygdala could help mediate the behavioral effects of glucocorticoids , and thus may be important therapeutic target for anxiety .

20381473|In this study , we employed a gene therapeutic approach to reduce anxiety and dendritic arborization of amygdaloid neurons of adult male Wistar rats .

20381473|When expressed in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , ERGR reduced anxiety , as tested on elevated plus-maze and open field , without affecting conditioned fear , another amygdala-dependent behavior .

20378100|This enhanced excitability of amygdala neurons after chronic stress may explain the observed hyperresponsiveness of the amygdala in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder and may facilitate the emergence of depression or anxiety in other patients .

20371508|The time course analysis also revealed greater right amygdala activity in patients with conversion disorder for happy stimuli -LRB- t = 2.96 , P = 0.006 -RRB- -LRB- with a trend for fearful stimuli , t = 1.81 , P = 0.08 -RRB- compared with healthy volunteers , with a pattern suggestive of impaired amygdala habituation even when controlling for depressive and anxiety symptoms .

20222060|We then provide examples of environmental factors that may exacerbate imbalances in amygdala-ventrofrontal function increasing risk for anxiety related behaviors .

20217377|Since hyperventilation induces hypocapnia , and enhanced amygdala activity may be involved in induction of a sense of anxiety , our findings might explain the neuronal mechanism of a vicious circle between hyperventilation and an increased sense of anxiety .

20207692|Reactivity in the right anterior insula was predictive of individuals ' subjective experience of anxious anticipation for both aversive and neutral stimuli , whereas the amygdala was predictive of anticipatory anxiety for aversive stimuli .

20153402|In the amygdala the glutamate system is involved in the acquisition , consolidation , expression and extinction of associative learning , which is a vital part of addiction , and in alcohol abusers it is associated with withdrawal anxiety and neurodegeneration .

20153402|The decreased expression of GLAST , GLT-1 and GluR2 in the alcoholic patients may increase glutamate tone and activity in the basolateral amygdala and this may contribute to neurodegeneration as well as the expression of associative memories and anxiety which underlie continued drug-seeking and chronic relapse .

20138896|Interestingly , anxiety and decision-making share underlying neural substrates , involving cortico-limbic pathways , including the amygdala , striatum and medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices .

20121862|Late adoption was associated with larger corrected amygdala volumes , poorer emotion regulation , and increased anxiety .

20121862|Although more than 50 % of the children who experienced orphanage rearing met criteria for a psychiatric disorder , with a third having an anxiety disorder , the group differences observed in amygdala volume were not driven by the presence of an anxiety disorder .

20102667|Animal models of anxiety disorders emphasize the crucial role of locus ceruleus-noradrenergic -LRB- norepinephrine , NE -RRB- signaling , the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and their interactions in the expression of anxiety-like behavioral responses to stress .

20100550|In conclusion , although the specific test conditions were sufficient to evoke behavioral alterations in exploration in the elevated plus-maze , they were enough to induce significant Fos protein expression in piriform cortex , septal nucleus and thalamic and hypothalamic paraventricular nuclei but not in other areas such as dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus and amygdala nuclei , known to be also active participants in circuits controlling fear and anxiety .

20084060|We found that the decrease in anxiety-like behavior after housing in enriched conditions was associated with very low levels of CRFR1 mRNA expression in the basolateral amygdala of C57BL/6 mice .

20084060|We further showed using a lentiviral-based system of RNA interference , that knockdown of CRFR1 mRNA expression in the basolateral amygdala induces a significant decrease in anxiety levels , similar to those achieved by EE nurture .

20084060|Our data strongly suggest that reduced expression of CRFR1 mRNA levels in the basolateral amygdala mediates the effect of EE on anxiety-like behavior .

20064565|Moreover , moderate treadmill exercise prevented BSO-induced anxiety-like behavior of rats and also prevented BSO-mediated increase in oxidative stress markers in serum , urine and brain tissue homogenates from hippocampus , amygdala and locus coeruleus .

20059553|In this study , we investigated whether altered NCAM expression levels in the amygdala might be related to stress-induced enhancement of auditory fear conditioning and anxiety-like behavior .

20059553|In adult C57BL/6J wild-type mice , chronic unpredictable stress resulted in an isoform-specific increase of NCAM expression -LRB- NCAM-140 and NCAM-180 -RRB- in the amygdala , as well as enhanced auditory fear conditioning and anxiety-like behavior .

20059553|Likewise , chronic stress in these conditional NCAM-deficient mice did not modify NCAM expression levels in the amygdala or hippocampus , while they showed enhanced anxiety-like behavior , questioning the involvement of NCAM in this type of behavior .

20052291|Previously , we found that stereotaxic implantation of corticosterone -LRB- CORT -RRB- onto the amygdala in rats induced anxiety and colonic hypersensitivity .

22110916|The present study investigated the development of anxiety-like behavior and amygdala sensitization in incisional pain .

22110916|The present study suggested that surgical incision could induce anxiety and amygdala sensitization that can be inhibited by morphine and gabapentin .

20041476|It is now well established that gabaergic , noradrenergic and serotonergic systems play a critical role in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders , abnormalities in these systems being related to structural and functional alterations in specific brain areas such as the amygdala , prefrontal cortex , locus coeruleus and hippocampus , as repeatedly shown by neuroimaging studies .

20006965|The present study therefore aimed to study the effects of bilateral electrolytic lesions of the medial amygdala on unconditioned anxiety-related behavior as well as a sensorimotor gating parameter -LRB- prepulse inhibition , PPI -RRB- in rats .

20006965|Bilateral electrolytic lesions of the medial amygdala decreased the SIH response and anxiety-related open field behavior .

20005920|This sample revealed increased conflict induced activation in the amygdala during processing of negative expressions which was associated with higher levels of anxiety and depressivity .

20005050|These results show that T4 administration in utero programs adult peripheral and amygdalar thyroid hormone levels divergently , and that the resulting upregulation of anxiety-related genes in the amygdala could be responsible for the exacerbated anxiety-like behavior seen in WKYs after prenatal T4 treatment .

20003287|Faster amygdala response to novelty may reflect a computational bias that leads to greater neophobic responses and represents a mechanism for the development of social anxiety .

20001112|Additionally , reactivity of amygdala-innervated effector systems is also essential for our understanding of anxiety-related behaviors .

19996041|Disrupted amygdalar subregion functional connectivity and evidence of a compensatory network in generalized anxiety disorder . .

19969038|The focus of the review is on studies addressing the roles of corticotropin-releasing factor -LRB- CRF -RRB- and noradrenaline pathways of the extended amygdala circuitry , and their direct or indirect interactions with the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system , in anxiety after withdrawal from cocaine and stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking .

19962861|At baseline , Trait Anxiety Inventory measures covaried positively with relative brain activity bilaterally in the dorsal anterior cingulate , superior temporal gyri , parahippocampal gyri , amygdala , hippocampus , ventral striatum , and right insula ; state anxiety showed a similar pattern .

19962861|Change in trait anxiety covaried positively with changes in relative activity in right amygdala and hippocampus .

19957279|The data indicate that the anxiety disorders share self-reported symptoms of anxiety and fear ; heightened anxiety and fear responding to cues that signal threat , cues that signal no threat , cues that formerly signaled threat , and contexts associated with threat ; elevated stress reactivity to aversive stimuli ; attentional biases to threat-relevant stimuli and threat-based appraisals of ambiguous stimuli ; and elevated amygdala responses to threat-relevant stimuli .

19945375|Ziemann et al. -LRB- 2009 -RRB- now show that acid-sensing channels in the amygdala mediate fear responses that accompany inhalation of carbon dioxide , suggesting that aberrant chemosensation may underlie anxiety disorders associated with a fear of suffocation .

19944771|The existing imaging literature on the neurobiological correlates of fear processing and anxiety disorders points to a pivotal role of the amygdala in the human fear circuit .

19944771|Therefore , amygdala responsiveness to anxiety-related stimuli was suggested as an intermediate phenotype for anxiety disorders .

19944771|The present article provides an overview of imaging genetic studies investigating genetic effects on amygdala responsiveness with particular emphasis on recent imaging genetic findings in anxiety-related traits , panic disorder and social phobia .

19931400|The current study investigated the association between BDNF genotype and amygdala-hippocampal responses to emotional stimuli in adolescents with anxiety disorders and/or major depressive disorder -LRB- MDD -RRB- and in healthy adolescents .

19931400|Twenty-seven unmedicated patients with acutely-impairing current anxiety disorders and/or MDD and 31 healthy adolescents , matched on age , gender and IQ , rated their fear of fearful , angry , neutral and happy facial expressions during collection of fMRI data on the amygdala and hippocampus .

19931360|The profile of amygdala subunit inter-relations was recapitulated in a step-down behavioral test ; anxiety was increased by acute and chronic stressors in BALB/cByJ mice , but in the C57BL/6ByJ strain the elevated anxiety associated with an acute stressor was not apparent after chronic stressor treatment .

19929444|We investigated in the rat the effects of a single exposure to psychophysical -LRB- electrical foot shock -RRB- vs. psychological -LRB- social defeat -RRB- stressors on anxiety - and depression-related behaviors , serum levels of corticosterone and the expression of plasticity-related genes CAM-L1 , CREB , GAP-43 , and laminin in the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- , the amygdala and the hippocampus .

19914601|5-hydroxytryptamine 2C receptors in the basolateral amygdala are involved in the expression of anxiety after uncontrollable traumatic stress . .

19914601|The goals of this study were to 1 -RRB- assess the effect of uncontrollable stress on extracellular serotonin in the basolateral amygdala during the anxiety test , 2 -RRB- determine whether DRN activity during a poststress anxiety test is involved in anxiety-like behavior , and 3 -RRB- determine the role of the serotonin 2C receptor -LRB- 5-HT -LRB- 2C -RRB- -RRB- in uncontrollable stress-induced anxiety .

19914044|Reduced anxiety and fatigue in A1 + men were significantly associated with greater activity within a right orbitofrontal region previously implicated in cognitive control , and less activity in structures associated with anxiety -LRB- amygdala -RRB- , fatigue -LRB- thalamus -RRB- , and craving/reinforcement -LRB- striatum -RRB- .

19884564|Greater activation of the amygdala suggests that AT -LRB- 1A -RRB- receptors normally inhibit the degree of stress-induced anxiety , whereas the lesser activation of the hypothalamus and rostral ventrolateral medulla suggests that AT -LRB- 1A -RRB- receptors play a key role in autonomic cardiovascular reactions to acute aversive stress , as well as for stress-induced inhibition of the baroreflex .

19875699|Recently , we demonstrated that corticosterone -LRB- Cort -RRB- placed on the amygdala induced anxiety-like behavior coupled with decreased thresholds for visceral and somatic pain in rats .

19875699|In the present study , we sought to define the distinct roles of amygdaloid GR and MR in anxiety-like behavior , visceral sensitivity , and somatic sensitivity through selective pharmacological activation .

19875699|In summary , GR and MR mediated-mechanisms induce anxiety and visceral hypersensitivity , whereas somatic sensitivity involves only GR , suggesting that corticosteroids may enhance visceral and somatic sensation via divergent processes originating in the amygdala and involving specific steroid receptor mechanisms .

19853006|Role of dopamine receptor mechanisms in the amygdaloid modulation of fear and anxiety : Structural and functional analysis . .

19853006|Dopamine plays an important role in fear and anxiety modulating a cortical brake that the medial prefrontal cortex exerts on the anxiogenic output of the amygdala and have an important influence on the trafficking of impulses between the basolateral -LRB- BLA -RRB- and central nuclei -LRB- CeA -RRB- of amygdala .

19853006|It is suggested that D1 - and D2-dopamine receptors in the amygdala may have a differential role in the modulation of anxiety .

19844978|In addition , high densities of double-labeled axons were observed in the lateral septal nucleus , posterior division of the BNST , medial amygdaloid nucleus , amygdalohippocampal area , and ventral hippocampus , forebrain areas associated with psychological stress and anxiety .

19843974|First , different doses of CRF microinjected weekly into the central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- before ethanol exposure produced a dose-related sensitization of anxiety during ethanol withdrawal .

19843974|Subsequently , CRF microinjection into the basolateral amygdala , dorsal raphe nucleus -LRB- DRN -RRB- , or dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- d-BNST -RRB- also sensitized ethanol withdrawal-induced anxiety .

19836379|This role for the ventral hippocampus in anxiety is distinct from the role of the amygdala in other aspects of emotional processing , such as fear conditioning .

19825899|The administration of alprazolam -LRB- 40 microg/kg , intraperitoneal -LRB- i.p. -RRB- -RRB- decreased anxiety-like behaviours in the light-dark box test and significantly reduced WIN-55 ,212 - stimulated -LSB- -LRB- 35 -RRB- S -RSB- GTPgamma binding autoradiography in the amygdala and in the CA1 field of the hippocampus , but was without effects on CA2 , CA3 and the dentate gyrus -LRB- DG -RRB- of the hippocampus .

19786076|Previous behavioral studies have shown that neuropeptides intrinsic to the amygdala formation can alter fear and anxiety states .

19762157|Additionally , second-born rats show increased anxiety-related behavior in a plus-maze test in adolescence and adulthood and abnormal developmental trajectories in terms of social interaction and BDNF levels in the amygdala and hippocampus compared to both the first-born litter and to animal facility reared controls .

19759308|The structural integrity of an amygdala-prefrontal pathway predicts trait anxiety . .

19759308|Here , we used diffusion tensor imaging -LRB- DTI -RRB- and showed that the strength of an axonal pathway identified between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex predicted individual differences in trait anxiety .

19759308|Individual differences in the structural integrity of this putative amygdala-prefrontal pathway were inversely correlated with trait anxiety levels -LRB- i.e. , higher pathway strength predicted lower anxiety -RRB- .

19716552|Blockade of protein phosphatase 2B activity in the amygdala increases anxiety - and depression-like behaviors in mice . .

19716552|Significant calcineurin expression can be observed with immunohistochemistry in the amygdala , a brain area important for behaviors related to mood disorders and anxiety .

19716552|Pharmacological CsA and viral-mediated gene transfer -LRB- adeno-associated viral expression of short hairpin RNA -LSB- AAV-shRNA -RSB- -RRB- approaches were used to inhibit calcineurin activity globally and selectively in the amygdala of the mouse brain to determine the role of calcineurin in behaviors related to depression and anxiety .

19716552|Systemic inhibition of calcineurin activity with CsA or local downregulation of calcineurin levels in the amygdala with AAV-delivered shRNAs targeting calcineurin A increased behavioral measures of anxiety in both the elevated plus maze and light/dark tests with no changes in locomotor activity .

19716552|Taken together , these data demonstrate that decreasing calcineurin activity in the amygdala increases anxiety - and depression-like behaviors .

19702789|Relative to C57BL/6 mice , BALB/c mice also have reduced benzodiazepine -LRB- BZ -RRB- receptor densities in the brain and fivefold less BZ receptor density in the amygdala , a region important in anxiety and in the control of arousal .

19693004|Phasic vs sustained fear in rats and humans : role of the extended amygdala in fear vs anxiety . .

19580851|In fear as induced by FPS , the central amygdaloid nucleus and the dorsolateral part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis loaded on the same component , but Fos-IR observed in these brain regions did not differentiate between anxiety and fear .

19568481|Functional brain imaging studies have demonstrated amygdala and insula hyper-reactivity to probes of social threat in participants with generalized social anxiety disorder -LRB- gSAD -RRB- .

19568481|Within the gSAD group , the extent of amygdala activation was correlated with social anxiety severity , whereas the extent of insula activation was correlated with trait anxiety .

19566756|Smaller amygdala is associated with anxiety in patients with panic disorder . .

19566756|Volume alterations in the brain of patients with panic disorder have previously been reported , but there has been no report of amygdala volume association with anxiety .

19566756|The state anxiety was negatively correlated with the left amygdala volume in patients with panic disorder -LRB- r = -0.545 , P = 0.016 -RRB- .

19566756|These findings suggested that the smaller volume of the amygdala may be associated with anxiety in panic disorder .

19565652|Emotional and anxiety-related behaviors were also improved by enriched stimuli , but the effect of enriched environments on the amygdala , one of the major emotion-related structures in the central nervous system , remains largely unknown .

19559573|Correlational analyses were conducted between hippocampal and amygdalar volumes , and anxiety scores .

19559573|No significant association was found between total amygdalar volume and anxiety scores .

19539663|We focused on the amygdala , a macrostructure known to be involved in the expression of anxiety - and fear-related behaviors .

19526456|Besides genes modulating neural transmission and influencing amygdala reactivity and anxiety-related temperamental traits a different plasticity regulating genes affect interindividual differences in emotional regulation .

19526456|We hypothesized that in humans the gene coding for stathmin -LRB- STMN1 -RRB- , which is highly expressed in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala and associated thalamic and cortical structures , influences behavioral responses to fear and anxiety stimuli by way of two common single nucleotide polymorphisms -LRB- rs182455 , SNP1 ; rs213641 , SNP2 -RRB- .

19526456|We used the acoustic startle paradigm and a standardized laboratory protocol for the induction of fear and psychosocial stress in 106 healthy volunteers to investigate the impact of stathmin gene variation on two fear - and anxiety-controlling effector-systems of the amygdala .

19469026|The unique features of stress-induced plasticity in the amygdala , in association with changes in other brain regions , could have long-term consequences for cognitive performance and pathological anxiety exhibited in people with affective disorders .

19427535|Furthermore , the noradrenergic alpha-2 receptor antagonist yohimbine -LRB- YOH -RRB- increases noradrenaline - -LRB- NA -RRB- cell firing and release in discrete brain areas involved in the modulation of anxiety such as the locus coeruleus -LRB- LC -RRB- and amygdala -LRB- AMY -RRB- .

19421027|Neuroanatomical findings revealed that CB1 cannabinoid and 5-HT3 receptors are coexpressed by a subtype of gamma-aminobutyric acid -LRB- GABA -RRB- ergic interneurons in the prefrontal cortex , hippocampus , and basolateral amygdala , three brain regions that are crucial for the control of anxiety .

19273493|Given that randomized controlled trials are now investigating a few doses of + / -3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine -LRB- MDMA , ` ecstasy ' -RRB- in combination with psychotherapy for treatment-resistant anxiety disorders , we would like to suggest the following three mechanisms for this potentially important new approach : 1 -RRB- MDMA increases oxytocin levels , which may strengthen the therapeutic alliance ; 2 -RRB- MDMA increases ventromedial prefrontal activity and decreases amygdala activity , which may improve emotional regulation and decrease avoidance and 3 -RRB- MDMA increases norepinephrine release and circulating cortisol levels , which may facilitate emotional engagement and enhance extinction of learned fear associations .

19258024|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BL -RRB- is a putative site for regulating anxiety , where inhibition and excitation respectively lead to decreases and increases in anxiety-like behaviors .

19258024|In addition to enhancing the phenotypic characterization , the extent to which the NK -LRB- 1r -RRB- cells of amygdala nuclei contribute to anxiety-like responses was also investigated .

19255377|Few studies directly compare amygdala function in depressive and anxiety disorders .

19255377|To compare amygdala response to varying attention and emotion conditions among adolescents with major depressive disorder -LRB- MDD -RRB- or anxiety disorders , relative to adolescents with no psychopathology .

19255377|Left and right amygdala activation differed as a function of diagnosis , facial expression , and attention condition both when patients with comorbid MDD and anxiety were included and when they were excluded -LRB- group x emotion x attention interactions , P < or = .03 -RRB- .

19255377|Focusing on fearful face-viewing events , patients with anxiety and those with MDD both differed in amygdala responses from healthy participants and from each other during passive viewing .

19255377|However , both MDD and anxiety groups , relative to healthy participants , exhibited similar signs of amygdala hyperactivation to fearful faces when subjectively experienced fear was rated .

19246474|Multiple lines of evidence implicate the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and the noradrenergic -LRB- norepinephrine , NE -RRB- system in responding to stressful stimuli such as fear signals , suggesting hyperfunction of both in the development of stress-related pathologies including anxiety disorders .

19246390|Although roles for the prefrontal cortex , amygdala , hippocampus and mediodorsal thalamus in anxiety disorders are well documented , molecular mechanisms contributing to the functions of these structures are poorly understood .

19204724|SK2 potassium channel overexpression in basolateral amygdala reduces anxiety , stress-induced corticosterone secretion and dendritic arborization . .

19204724|The basolateral amygdala is critical for generation of anxiety .

19204724|Demonstrated ability of the amygdala to change in response to stress and glucocorticoids could thus be important therapeutic target for anxiety management .

19204724|Several studies have reported a relationship between anxiety and dendritic arborization of the amygdaloid neurons .

19204724|In this study we employed a gene therapeutic approach to reduce anxiety and dendritic arborization of the amygdala neurons .

19204724|Our choice of therapeutic cargo was guided by the indications that activation of the amygdala might underlie anxiety and that SK2 could reduce neuronal activation by exerting inhibitory influence on action potentials .

19200075|Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate the role of the hippocampus , amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- in a contextual conditioning and extinction paradigm provoking anxiety .

19185207|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is a major emotional center in the brain and regulates the expression of anxiety .

19184657|Irritability and anxiety may involve alterations in endogenous opioid systems and other regions , such as the amygdala .

19158294|We found that TrkB.T1-deficient mice develop normally but show increased anxiety in association with morphological abnormalities in the length and complexity of neurites of neurons in the basolateral amygdala .

19154647|Influence of the fusiform gyrus on amygdala response to emotional faces in the non-clinical range of social anxiety . .

19154647|Functional imaging has demonstrated an increase in amygdala response to emotional faces in subjects with social anxiety .

19154647|We assessed the influence of the fusiform gyrus activation on amygdala response to emotional faces in the non-clinical range of social anxiety .

19154647|A dimensional analysis approach was used involving voxel-wise mapping of the correlation between subjects ' social anxiety scores and amygdala activation , before and after controlling for fusiform gyrus activation .

19154647|We observed that only after controlling for subjects ' level of activation of the fusiform gyrus was there an association between social anxiety ratings and amygdala response to both happy and fearful faces .

19154647|Relevant interactions among the emotional face-processing stages exist in the non-clinical range of social anxiety that may ultimately attenuate amygdala responses .

19153574|Here we examined the explicit interactions between the brain-derived neurotrophic factor -LRB- BDNF -RRB- Val66Met gene and early life stress -LRB- ELS -RRB- exposure in brain -LRB- amygdala-hippocampal-prefrontal gray matter volume -RRB- , body -LRB- heart rate -RRB- , temperament and cognition in 374 healthy European volunteers assessed for depression and anxiety symptoms .

19153574|In contrast , the combination of BDNF V/V genotype and ELS predicted increases in gray matter of the amygdala -LRB- P = 0.003 -RRB- and associated medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- , which in turn predicted startle-elicited heart rate variability -LRB- P = 0.026 -RRB- and higher anxiety -LRB- P = 0.026 -RRB- .

19145562|The anxiogenic-like behavioral phenotype observed following both pharmacological and genetic blockade of cannabinoid CB1 receptors , together with the abundant expression of cannabinoid receptors within brain areas particularly involved in emotional control , such as amygdala , hippocampus and cortex , are among the numerous evidences that account for the participation of the endocannabinoid system in the regulation of anxiety states .

19142220|In humans , variation upstream of the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene -LRB- 5-HTTLPR -RRB- has recently been shown to influence both behavioral measures of social anxiety and amygdala response to social threats .

19125211|Genotype over-diagnosis in amygdala responsiveness : affective processing in social anxiety disorder . .

19125211|Although the amygdala is thought to be a crucial brain region for negative affect , neuroimaging studies do not always show enhanced amygdala response to aversive stimuli in patients with anxiety disorders .

19125211|We investigated the influence of these polymorphisms on amygdala responsiveness to angry faces in patients with social anxiety disorder -LRB- SAD -RRB- compared with healthy controls .

19124686|Effects of HTR1A C -LRB- -1019 -RRB- G on amygdala reactivity and trait anxiety . .

19124686|To evaluate the effects of HTR1A C -LRB- -1019 -RRB- G on amygdala reactivity and to use path analyses to explore the impact of HTR1A-mediated variability in amygdala reactivity on individual differences in trait anxiety .

19124686|We hypothesized that -1019 G , which potentially results in decreased serotonin signaling , would be associated with relatively decreased amygdala reactivity and related trait anxiety .

19124686|While there were no direct genotype effects on trait anxiety , HTR1A C -LRB- -1019 -RRB- G indirectly predicted 9.2 % of interindividual variability in trait anxiety through its effects on amygdala reactivity .

19124686|Our findings further implicate relatively increased serotonin signaling , associated with a genetic variation that mediates increased 5-HT -LRB- 1A -RRB- autoreceptors , in driving amygdala reactivity and trait anxiety .

19122541|There is a consensus on the crucial role of the amygdala , anterior cingulate cortex and insula in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders .

19122007|Anticipatory activation in the amygdala and anterior cingulate in generalized anxiety disorder and prediction of treatment response . .

19122007|This study tested whether patients with generalized anxiety disorder have alterations in anticipatory amygdala function and whether anticipatory activity in the anterior cingulate cortex predicts treatment response .

19122007|Patients with generalized anxiety disorder showed greater anticipatory activity than healthy comparison subjects in the bilateral dorsal amygdala preceding both aversive and neutral pictures .

19122007|These findings of heightened and indiscriminate amygdala responses to anticipatory signals in generalized anxiety disorder and of anterior cingulate cortex associations with treatment response provide neurobiological support for the role of anticipatory processes in the pathophysiology of generalized anxiety disorder .

20582274|Role of anxiety in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome : importance of the amygdala . .

20582274|The amygdala is an important structure for regulating anxiety with the central nucleus of the amygdala facilitating the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the autonomic nervous system in response to stress .

20582274|This review outlines the latest findings obtained from human studies and animal models related to the role of the emotional brain in the regulation of enteric function , specifically how increasing the gain of the amygdala to induce anxiety-like behavior using corticosterone or chronic stress increases responsiveness to both visceral and somatic stimuli in rodents .

20582274|A focus of the review is the relative importance of mineralocorticoid receptor and glucocorticoid receptor-mediated mechanisms within the amygdala in the regulation of anxiety and nociceptive behaviors that are characteristic features of IBS .

19109502|Reportedly , both cGKI and cGKII are expressed in the amygdala , and cGKII is involved in controlling anxiety-like behavior .

19103437|The 385A carriers showed decreased correlation between amygdala reactivity and trait anxiety but increased correlation between ventral striatal reactivity and delay discounting , an index of impulsivity .

19088455|Phosphatidylinositide dependent kinase deficiency increases anxiety and decreases GABA and serotonin abundance in the amygdala . .

19088455|Pathological anxiety is paralleled by deficits in serotonergic and GABAergic neurotransmission in the amygdala .

19079249|Many neurocognitive models of anxiety emphasize the importance of a hyper-responsive threat-detection system centered on the amygdala , with recent accounts incorporating a role for prefrontal mechanisms in regulating attention to threat .

19076365|In a previous work it was demonstrated that emotional stressors trigger the in vivo release of the neuropeptide substance P -LRB- SP -RRB- in brain areas known to be implicated in stress and anxiety mechanisms , such as the amygdala , lateral septum , nucleus accumbens , and locus coeruleus .

19056466|The goal of the present experiment was to study the performance of inbred Roman high - -LRB- RHA-I -RRB- and low - -LRB- RLA-I -RRB- avoidance rats in one-way avoidance learning and to relate the behaviour of the animals to cellular density in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , a brain region related to fear and anxiety .

19052197|A link between serotonin-related gene polymorphisms , amygdala activity , and placebo-induced relief from social anxiety . .

19052197|Hence , our study shows , for the first time , evidence of a link between genetically controlled serotonergic modulation of amygdala activity and placebo-induced anxiety relief .

19015118|These findings add support to the model of Gray and McNaughton , which proposes a role of the hippocampus in the regulation of defensive/approach behaviours and trait anxiety but suggest an absence of associations between amygdala volume and BIS/BAS measures .

19015105|Results demonstrated -LRB- i -RRB- that both tasks activated anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula , consistent with prior work ; -LRB- ii -RRB- whereas self-pain activated anterior and mid insula regions implicated in interoception and nociception , other pain activated frontal , premotor , parietal and amygdala regions implicated in emotional learning and processing social cues ; and -LRB- iii -RRB- that levels of trait anxiety correlated with activity in rostral lateral prefrontal cortex during perception of other pain but not during self-pain .

19015089|Neurobiological evidence implicates the amygdala as well as serotonergic -LRB- serotonin , 5-HT -RRB- signaling via postsynaptic 5-HT -LRB- 2A -RRB- receptors as essential substrates of anxiety behaviors .

19003957|Corticotrophin-releasing factor -LRB- CRF -RRB- is expressed in the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , where the CRF receptor -LRB- CRFr -RRB- plays an important role in anxiety - and stress-related behaviors .

18996489|Given the inherent differences between anger and fear , we hypothesised that anxiety would modulate the amygdala response to angry faces to a greater extent when attended .

18996489|Following previous research , we expected anxiety to show a stronger relationship with the amygdala response to unattended fearful faces .

18996489|The results showed that higher anxiety levels produced an increased right amygdala response to viewer directed angry facial expressions -LRB- versus neutral or fearful faces -RRB- only when attended .

18996489|By contrast , increased anxiety was associated with a greater left amygdala response to fearful faces -LRB- versus neutral or angry faces -RRB- in the unattended condition , with only borderline evidence for attended fear -LRB- relative to neutral -RRB- .

18981342|To determine whether photographs of negatively evaluated smiling peers viewed during anticipated social evaluation engage the amygdala and vlPFC differentially in adolescents with and without social anxiety .

18977372|Previously we found that exposure of the amygdala to elevated levels of corticosterone -LRB- CORT -RRB- induces anxiety-like behavior coupled to colonic hypersensitivity to distension , however , the specific corticoid receptor mediating the CORT responses remains controversial .

18973598|Chronic stress-induced alterations in amygdala responsiveness and behavior -- modulation by trait anxiety and corticotropin-releasing factor systems . .

18973598|The basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- plays a key role in emotional arousal and anxiety , and expresses high levels of corticotropin-releasing factor receptor -LRB- CRFR -RRB- 1 .

18971295|The amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- are thought to subserve distinct functions , with the former mediating rapid fear responses to discrete sensory cues and the latter longer '' anxiety-like '' states in response to diffuse environmental contingencies .

18951955|To determine if exposure to the open-field activates a subset of neurons in the midbrain raphe complex that projects to forebrain circuits regulating anxiety states , we used cholera toxin B subunit -LRB- CTb -RRB- as a retrograde tracer to identify neurons projecting to the basolateral amygdaloid complex -LRB- BL -RRB- in combination with c-Fos immunostaining to identify cells that responded to open-field exposure .

18951955|These data are consistent with the hypothesis that exposure to anxiogenic stimuli activates a subset of neurons in the midbrain raphe complex projecting to amygdala anxiety circuits .

18930832|Here , we show that when infused in the amygdala immediately after inhibitory avoidance training , but not later , the NO synthase inhibitor L-NNA hindered long-term memory retention without affecting locomotion , exploratory behavior , anxiety state or retrieval of the avoidance response .

18849647|In the present study , we investigated the effects and interaction of nicotinic and GABAergic systems in the central amygdala of rats , using the elevated plus maze test of anxiety .

18838040|The amygdala , striatum , and structures within the prefrontal cortex are highly involved in mediating these stages of emotion processing , and evidence indicates that these regions show structural and functional alterations in different types of psychopathology , including anxiety , depression , and autism spectrum disorders .

18838035|We review the fMRI data indicating that particular comorbidities of CD/ODD -LRB- i.e. , mood and anxiety conditions such as childhood bipolar disorder and PTSD -RRB- are associated with either increased responsiveness of neural regions implicated in the basic response to threat -LRB- e.g. , the amygdala -RRB- or decreased responsiveness in regions of frontal cortex -LRB- e.g. , ventromedial frontal cortex -RRB- that are implicated in the regulation of the basic threat response .

18809390|Assessment of anxiety-like behaviors in female rats bred for differences in kindling susceptibility and amygdala excitability . .

18809390|In combination with previous research on these strains , the present data tentatively suggest that Fast and Slow animals utilize different neural systems in tests of fear and anxiety which may have been co-selected with the direct selection of amygdala-kindling susceptibility .

18803281|Correlated well with the reduced anxiety , expression of GABA -LRB- A -RRB- alpha -LRB- 1 -RRB- receptor was higher whereas c-Fos was lower in the cortex , hippocampus , and amygdala of the mice expressing PS2 mutation than those of the wild-type PS2 or nontransgenic control mice .

18800067|Stress and anxiety are mainly regulated by amygdala and hypothalamic circuitries involving several neurotransmitter systems and providing physiological responses to peripheral organs via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and other pathways .

18797248|Cannabinoid CB1 receptors of the rat central amygdala mediate anxiety-like behavior : interaction with the opioid system . .

18797248|In this study , we investigated the effects of intraperitoneal -LRB- i.p. -RRB- injection of opioid drugs on responses induced by intracentral amygdala -LRB- intra-CeA -RRB- microinjection of cannabinoid CB1 receptor agents in rats , using the elevated plus maze test of anxiety .

18790016|Early weaning induces anxiety and precocious myelination in the anterior part of the basolateral amygdala of male Balb/c mice . .

18790016|Here , we demonstrate that in addition to increasing anxiety , early-weaning manipulations alter the accumulation of galactosylceramide , a specific myelin constituent , and the axonal structure of myelinated fibers in the amygdala of male Balb/c mice .

18790016|These results suggest that the higher anxiety levels observed in early-weaned male mice could be related to precocious myelin formation in the anterior part of the basolateral amygdala .

18725236|Acute withdrawal from all major drugs of abuse produces increases in reward thresholds , increases in anxiety-like responses , and increases in extracellular levels of CRF in the central nucleus of the amygdala .

18717711|In right TLE patients , left and right amygdala activation was significantly related to preoperative anxiety and depression levels , and preoperative right amygdala activation correlated significantly with postoperative change of anxiety and depression scores , characterized by greater increases in anxiety and depression in patients with greater preoperative activation .

18700839|Disruption of TIP39 projections to the medial prefrontal cortex , lateral septum , bed nucleus of the stria terminalis , hypothalamus and amygdala likely account for the fear - and anxiety-related phenotype of TIP39-KO .

18678764|Furthermore , we observed that the magnitude of amygdala activity is positively correlated with trait anxiety of the participants .

18673452|It has been shown that anxiety and stress responses are modulated by substance P -LRB- SP -RRB- released within the amygdala .

18673452|To study a possible self-regulating role of SP , we used a selective neurokinin-1 -LRB- NK1 -RRB- receptor antagonist to investigate whether blockade of NK1 receptors results in altered basal and/or stress-evoked SP release in the medial amygdala -LRB- MeA -RRB- , a critical brain area for a functional involvement of SP transmission in enhanced anxiety responses induced by stressor exposure .

18667157|These results identify mechanisms of NPS in the brain , a key role of intercalated neurons in the amygdala for fear extinction , and a potential pharmacological avenue for treating anxiety disorders .

18655902|Oxytocin potently reduced amygdala activation and decreased coupling to brainstem regions implicated in autonomic and behavioural manifestations of fear , indicating a neural mechanism for the effects of oxytocin in social cognition in humans and providing a potential therapeutic approach to social anxiety currently being tested in social phobia and autism .

18655890|Steroidal/neuropeptide interactions in hypothalamus and amygdala related to social anxiety . .

18655890|Here we argue that hyperactivity in ascending central nervous system arousal systems would work in the opposite direction : increasing social anxiety by potentiating fear-related mechanisms in the amygdala .

18653439|Acute withdrawal from all major drugs of abuse produces increases in reward thresholds , anxiety-like responses and extracellular levels of CRF in the central nucleus of the amygdala .

18651175|NE and CRF transmission in the extended amygdala are also implicated in the increased anxiety that occurs during prolonged abstinence from chronic opiates , cocaine , ethanol , and cannabinoids .

18651175|Together , these findings suggest that involvement of the extended amygdala and its noradrenergic afferents in anxiety , stress-induced relapse , and altered reward processing reflects a common function for these circuits in stress modulation of drug-seeking .

18621039|Centrally injected benzodiazepine drugs attenuate anxiety in some limbic structures , such as hypothalamus , amygdala and the midbrain periaqueductal gray -LRB- PAG -RRB- .

18617194|Given that the amygdala is a major emotional center in the brain and regulates the expression of both learned fear and anxiety , neurotransmitter systems within the basolateral amygdala represent likely mechanisms governing the anxiety-related effects of acute ethanol exposure .

18616985|Exposure to an open-field arena increases c-Fos expression in a distributed anxiety-related system projecting to the basolateral amygdaloid complex . .

18616985|Anxiety states and anxiety-related behaviors appear to be regulated by a distributed and highly interconnected system of brain structures including the basolateral amygdala .

18616985|In order to identify candidate brain regions mediating anxiety-induced activation of the basolateral amygdaloid complex in rats , we used cholera toxin B subunit -LRB- CTb -RRB- as a retrograde tracer to identify neurons with direct afferent projections to this region in combination with c-Fos immunostaining to identify cells responding to exposure to an open-field arena in low-light -LRB- 8-13 lux -RRB- conditions -LRB- an anxiogenic stimulus in rats -RRB- .

18616985|These data are consistent with the hypothesis that exposure to the open-field arena activates an anxiety-related neuronal system with convergent input to the basolateral amygdaloid complex .

18614671|A polymorphism in the human serotonin transporter -LRB- 5-HTT -RRB- gene is implicated in susceptibility to anxiety and depression and in enhanced emotion-induced activation in the amygdala .

18596687|We previously showed that betaxolol , a selective beta -LRB- 1 -RRB- - adrenergic receptor antagonist , administered during early phases of cocaine abstinence , ameliorated withdrawal-induced anxiety and blocked increases in amygdalar beta -LRB- 1 -RRB- - adrenergic receptor expression in rats .

18596687|Here , we report the efficacy of betaxolol in reducing increases in gene expression of amygdalar corticotropin-releasing factor -LRB- CRF -RRB- , a peptide known to be involved in mediating ` anxiety-like ' behaviors during initial phases of cocaine abstinence .

18596687|The present findings suggest that the efficacy of betaxolol treatment on cocaine withdrawal-induced anxiety may be related , in part , to its effect on amygdalar beta -LRB- 1 -RRB- - adrenergic receptor , modulation of its downstream cell-signaling elements and CRF gene expression .

18591476|A number of questions including the automaticity of the amygdala response to threat distractors , the modulation by anxiety of the amygdala and prefrontal response to these stimuli , and the impact of genetic and environmental factors upon this circuitry are addressed .

18591476|Individual differences in trait and state anxiety , and in genetic makeup , are thought to modulate the influence of stimulus valence and top-down attention through their impact upon amygdala and prefrontal function .

18551525|Enrichment of Wfs1 protein in the central extended amygdala suggests a role in the modulation of anxiety and fear .

18536707|The occurrence of stress and anxiety disorders has been closely associated with alterations of the amygdala GABAergic system .

18533199|This study determined the effects of mGluR7 and mGluR8 activation in the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- on nocifensive and affective pain responses and on pain-related anxiety-like behavior of adult rats .

18483136|The patients with generalized social phobia without generalized anxiety disorder showed increased activation to fearful relative to neutral expressions in several regions , including the amygdala , compared to healthy individuals .

18483136|This increased amygdala response related to self-reported anxiety in patients with generalized social phobia without generalized anxiety disorder .

18477857|GABA and histamine interaction in the basolateral amygdala of rats in the plus-maze test of anxiety-like behaviors . .

18477857|In the present study , we have investigated the effects and the interaction of the GABAergic and histaminergic systems in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- of rats using the plus-maze test of anxiety-like behaviors .

18473172|The amygdala plays a key role in anxiety .

18473172|Based on evidence from our laboratory the concept is introduced that neurotransmitters in the amygdala can modulate anxiety involving changes in fear learning and memories by effects on receptor mosaics in the fear circuits through wiring and volume transmission modes of communication .

18466667|We examined how individual differences in trait anxiety -LRB- TA -RRB- influence the neural responses associated with the acquisition and extinction of anticipatory anxiety elicited through a context conditioning paradigm , with particular focus on the amygdala and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- sgACC -RRB- .

18466667|Our results support the idea that individuals with high levels of anxiety-relevant traits and vulnerable to developing an anxiety disorder display a more resilient anxiety response during extinction that is characterized by hyper-responsivity in the amygdala .

18458208|When viewing masked angry faces , youth with GAD relative to comparison subjects showed greater right amygdala activation that positively correlated with anxiety disorder severity .

18456873|The Bay 60-7550-mediated decrease in oxidative stress -LRB- i.e. , superoxide anion and reactive oxygen species generation in cultured neurons and total antioxidant capacity and lipid peroxides in amygdala and hypothalamus -RRB- and expression of NADPH oxidase subunits -LRB- i.e. , p47 phox and gp91 phox expression in amygdala , hypothalamus , and cultured neurons -RRB- was associated with increased cGMP and phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein at Ser239 , suggesting an important role of cGMP-protein kinase G signaling in reduction of anxiety .

18456284|Involvement of opioidergic system of the ventral hippocampus , the nucleus accumbens or the central amygdala in anxiety-related behavior . .

18456284|In the present study , the influence of opioidergic system of the ventral hippocampus , the nucleus accumbens or the central amygdala on anxiety-related behaviour was investigated in rats .

18452757|This age-related difference decreased with repeated exposures to the stimuli , and individual differences in self-ratings of anxiety predicted the extent of adaptation or habituation in amygdala .

18424607|IL-1 administration slowed rat learning in the water maze and increased anxiety-like behavior , changes which were associated with increased homovanillic acid and 5-HT turnover , decreased NA in the hippocampus and amygdala , decreased DA in the frontal cortex , and decreased IL-10 in limbic brain regions .

18423428|Role of beta1-adrenoceptor in the basolateral amygdala of rats with anxiety-like behavior . .

18423428|There are evidence suggesting that the function of adrenergic receptor is affected in the amygdala of animals with anxiety-like behavior .

18423428|In order to determine the function of the beta1-AR subtype in anxiety-like behavior , we investigated the change of beta1-AR expression by immunostaining in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- of rats treated by conditional fear training .

18418359|However , the amygdala , a brain area repeatedly implicated in fear and anxiety processes , is known to contain large numbers of SP-containing neurons and SP receptors .

18418359|Several studies have implicated SP neurotransmission within the amygdala in anxiety processes .

18412102|Neuroanatomical and neuroimaging research in anxiety disorders has centered on the role of the amygdala , reciprocal connections between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex , and , most recently , alterations in interoceptive processing by the anterior insula .

18410955|The purpose of the present study was to characterize functional changes in the amygdala that accompany the extinction of context-dependent conditioned fear stress in a rat , an animal model of anxiety .

18410168|Chronic immobilization stress -LRB- CIS -RRB- induces anxiety behavior and dendritic hypertrophy in the basolateral amygdala , which persist beyond a recovery period .

18400885|Pain-related plasticity in the laterocapsular division of the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeLC -RRB- generates emotional-affective responses and anxiety-like behavior .

18396414|Functional brain imaging studies have shown deviant amygdala responses to emotional stimuli in subjects suffering from anxiety and depressive disorder , but both hyperactivity and hypoactivity compared to healthy controls have been reported .

18396414|To test this hypothesis , we assessed amygdala responses to an emotional faces paradigm during functional magnetic resonance imaging in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for the risk of anxiety and depression -LRB- n = 10 pairs -RRB- and in monozygotic twin pairs concordant for high -LRB- n = 7 pairs -RRB- or low -LRB- n = 15 pairs -RRB- risk for anxiety and depression .

18396414|Our findings indicate amygdala hyperactivity in subjects who are at high risk for anxiety and depression through environmental factors and amygdala hypoactivity in those at risk mainly through genetic factors .

18391224|Acute corticosterone treatment is sufficient to induce anxiety and amygdaloid dendritic hypertrophy . .

18391224|Stress is known to induce dendritic hypertrophy in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and to enhance anxiety .

18391224|To address the possible effects of GC on neurons of amygdala and on anxiety , we used rats treated either acutely with a single dose or chronically with 10 daily doses of high physiological levels of corticosterone -LRB- the rat-specific glucocorticoid -RRB- .

18385331|However , the anxiety-like behaviors during withdrawal after chronic alcohol exposure were associated with an increase in HDAC activity and decreases in acetylation of H3 and H4 , and levels of both CBP and NPY in the amygdala .

18385331|Blocking the observed increase in HDAC activity during alcohol withdrawal with the HDAC inhibitor , trichostatin A , rescued the deficits in H3 and H4 acetylation and NPY expression -LRB- mRNA and protein levels -RRB- in the amygdala -LRB- central and medial nucleus of amygdala -RRB- and prevented the development of alcohol withdrawal-related anxiety in rats as measured by the elevated plus maze and light/dark box exploration tests .

18374843|Functional neuroimaging studies point to increased activity in amygdala and insula in patients with social anxiety disorder , and genetic studies are increasingly focusing on this and other -LRB- eg , personality trait neuroticism -RRB- core phenotypes to identify risk loci .

20633378|Because the vagus nerve sends information to brain regions important in anxiety regulation -LRB- locus coeruleus , orbitofrontal cortex , insula , hippocampus and amygdala -RRB- , this pathway might be involved in perceiving or manifesting various somatic and cognitive symptoms that characterize anxiety disorders .

18359276|In pediatric CPS , left amygdala involvement may reflect effects of the neuropathology underlying comorbid affective or anxiety disorders on amygdala development rather than effects of ongoing seizures .

18336570|Previous studies have shown that distinct neuronal pathways modulate different emotional behaviours : while the amygdala plays a key role in fear-conditioned-to-cue stimuli , the bed nucleus of stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- is implicated in anxiety behaviour and responses to contextual stimuli .

18336570|In the present study , we assessed anxiety -LRB- measured in the elevated-plus maze and acoustic startle apparatus -RRB- and fear-conditioned responses to light stimuli in rats that had been exposed to either chronic unpredictable stress or corticosterone for 28 days ; thereafter , stereological estimates of the BNST and amygdaloid complex were performed , followed by three-dimensional morphometric dendritic analysis .

18316676|In independent samples , RGS2 markers , including rs4606 , which has previously been associated with RGS2 expression , were also associated with introversion -LRB- a core personality trait in social anxiety disorder -RRB- and with increased limbic activation -LRB- insular cortex and amygdala -RRB- during emotion processing -LRB- brain phenotypes correlated with social anxiety -RRB- .

18314269|The alexithymia feature difficulties identifying feelings was negatively correlated with the neural response of the right amygdala to masked sad faces , even when controlling for depressivity and anxiety .

18308474|The amygdala modulates memory consolidation with the storage of emotionally relevant information and plays a critical role in fear and anxiety .

18288095|We have previously reported that administering repeated subanxiogenic doses -LRB- termed ` priming ' -RRB- of the CRF receptor agonist urocortin 1 -LRB- Ucn1 -RRB- into the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- of rats elicited long-lasting behavioral changes in social interaction -LRB- SI -RRB- and elevated plus maze -LRB- EPM -RRB- tests of anxiety .

18288095|Although substantial similarity exists , the bed nucleus of the stria terminals -LRB- BNST -RRB- and the amygdala are thought to play distinct roles in anxiety responses .

18280467|The actions of vasopressin in the amygdala and lateral septum may represent at least part of the neuronal substrate by which vasopressin influences fear and anxiety-related behavior and social recognition , respectively .

18271022|Higher binding in the central nucleus of the amygdala of C. sociabilis was consistent with the hypothesis that formation of social groups in C. sociabilis may be facilitated by reduced social anxiety .

18268503|In patients , low serotonin transporter availability correlated with high anxiety -LRB- thalamus : r = -0.78 , P = 0.004 ; midbrain : r = -0.78 , P = 0.004 ; amygdala : r = -0.80 , P = 0.003 -RRB- .

18257652|Poor functioning of amygdala has also been associated with anxiety , autism , depression , narcolepsy , post-traumatic stress disorder , phobias , frontotemporal dementia , and schizophrenia .

18247161|However , evidence suggests that estrogens may exert their influence on fear and anxiety within the amygdala .

18243386|In association with the acquisition of increased anxiety-like behaviour at PW10 , glucocorticoid receptor expression was decreased in the amygdala in dexamethasone-exposed offspring at PW7 and PW10 .

18234524|Post hoc analysis of subgroups with higher versus lower levels of lifetime trauma exposure revealed systematic associations between amygdala gray matter volume , amygdala functional reactivity , and anxiety that suggest a nonlinear trajectory in the neural response to accumulated trauma in healthy adults .

18216773|The role of amygdalar mu-opioid receptors in anxiety-related responses in two rat models . .

18216773|This study compared the influences of mu-opioid receptor -LRB- MOR -RRB- activation in the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CEA -RRB- on unconditioned fear or anxiety-like responses in two models , the elevated plus maze , and the defensive burying test .

18216773|Our results demonstrate that MOR activation in the central amygdala exerts distinctive effects in two different models of unconditioned fear or anxiety-like responses , and suggest that opioids may exert context-specific regulation of amygdalar output circuits and behavioral responses during exposure to potential threats -LRB- open arms of the maze -RRB- vs discrete threats -LRB- predator odor -RRB- .

18204824|Strong and discrete expression of their receptors in the extended amygdala suggests a potential role in regulating stress responses , emotion , anxiety and fear ; however , there have been no functional studies to date to support this possibility .

18195718|As shown by in situ hybridization , real-Time PCR and immunohistochemistry , 5 days of intracerebroventricular -LRB- i.c.v. -RRB- injections of a subeffective dose -LRB- 2.3 pmol -RRB- of cortagine , a CRF -LRB- 1 -RRB- - selective agonist , resulted in an increase in CCK mRNA levels and CCK -LRB- 2 -RRB- receptor immunoreactivity in several brain regions , such as amygdala and hippocampus , known to be involved in the regulation of anxiety .

18190969|The amygdala functions as a switch between the anxiety-like patterns of T1 to the cognitive control of fear prevalent in T2 .

18185497|A wealth of research identifies the amygdala as a key brain region mediating negative affect , and implicates amygdala dysfunction in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders .

18185497|Although there is a strong genetic component to anxiety disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- there remains debate about whether abnormalities in amygdala function predispose to these disorders .

18185497|Our study provides a unique example of how natural variation in amygdala volume associates with specific fear - and stress-related phenotypes in rodents , and further supports the role of amygdala dysfunction in anxiety disorders such as PTSD .

18171711|A major site of extra-hypothalamic expression of CRF and its receptors is the amygdala , a key player in affect-related disorders such as anxiety .

20054425|Chronic exposure or extended access to self-administration of all major drugs of abuse produces during abstinence increases in reward thresholds , increases in aversive anxiety-like responses , increases in extracellular levels of CRF in the central nucleus of the amygdala , and increases in drug self-administration .

18095276|While only a few studies investigated the brain activation patterns following CCK-4 , no data are available on the putative involvement of the amygdala in the CCK-4 elicited anxiety response .

18095276|We studied the functional correlates of CCK-4-induced anxiety in healthy volunteers by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- and region of interest -LRB- ROI -RRB- analysis of the amygdala .

18095276|In conclusion , while overall brain activation patterns are not related to the subjective anxiety response to CCK-4 , amygdala activation may be involved in the subjective perception of CCK-4-induced fear .

18088282|Role of the amygdaloid cholecystokinin -LRB- CCK -RRB- / gastrin-2 receptors and terminal networks in the modulation of anxiety in the rat .

18088282|The amygdala plays a key role in fear and anxiety .

18088282|In this study , the nature of the CCK-glutamate-GABA interactions within the rat rostral amygdala , and their relevance for anxiety , were studied .

18088282|It is suggested that CCK modulates glutamate-GABA mechanisms by acting on CCK-2 receptors via volume transmission occurring at the level of the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus and/or by synaptic or perisynaptic volume transmission in the region of the rostrolateral main and paracapsular intercalated islands , resulting in subsequent disinhibition of the central amygdaloid nucleus and anxiety or panic-like behaviour .

18079066|Analysis of the anxiolytic-like effect of TRH and the response of amygdalar TRHergic neurons in anxiety . .

18079066|The participation of amygdalar TRH neurons in anxiety was confirmed in the EPM where TRH expression and release correlated with the number of entries , and the % of time spent in open arms , supporting an anxiolytic role of these TRH-neurons .

18068954|Trait anxiety and sex have been shown to separately account for some of the observed individual differences in amygdala responses to emotional stimuli , but the combined effect of both factors remains unknown .

18068954|We observed an interaction between sex and trait anxiety in amygdala responses to fearful faces as a function of attention .

18068954|In females , higher trait anxiety was associated with a stronger amygdala response to unattended fearful faces , whereas no such relationship was present in males .

18060697|We investigated the effect of acupuncture on anxiety-like behavior and corticotrophin-releasing factor -LRB- CRF -RRB- and neuropeptide Y -LRB- NPY -RRB- mRNA expression in the amygdala during nicotine withdrawal .

18060697|These findings indicate that increases in CRF may be involved in the negative affect state associated with nicotine withdrawal and that acupuncture may attenuate anxiety-like behavior following nicotine withdrawal by modulating CRF in the amygdala .

18058089|The distinction between phasic fear to imminent threat and sustained anxiety to temporally uncertain danger is suggested by psychopharmacological and behavioral evidence from ethological studies and can be traced back to distinct neuroanatomical systems , the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis .

18046310|Pathophysiological alterations of neuronal excitability in the amygdala are characteristic features of temporal lobe epilepsy and certain -LRB- epilepsy accompanying -RRB- psychiatric illnesses such as anxiety and depressive disorders .

18041716|Individuals with greater levels of trait anxiety showed delayed activation of Brodmann Area 45 in response to the fearful and happy faces , and lowered Brodmann Area 45 activation with prolonged left amygdala activation in response to the neutral faces .

18024182|The implications of this finding for understanding the role of the amygdala in vigilance , threat assessment and anxiety are considered here .

18005496|This excessive amygdala response to fear may reflect difficulty in managing anxiety reactions elicited during CBT , and this factor may limit optimal response to therapy .

17988803|The basolateral amygdala complex -LRB- BLA -RRB- and central amygdala nucleus -LRB- CeA -RRB- are involved in fear and anxiety .

17980908|Roles of the bed nucleus of stria terminalis and of the amygdala in N/OFQ-mediated anxiety and HPA axis activation . .

17964548|Here , we sought to determine whether pretreatment amygdala and rostral ACC -LRB- rACC -RRB- reactivity to facial expressions could predict treatment outcomes in patients with generalized anxiety disorder -LRB- GAD -RRB- .

17959260|Effects of D-cycloserine on the behavior and ERK activity in the amygdala : role of individual anxiety levels . .

17957217|Moreover , the microinjection of paroxetine into the basolateral amygdala or cingulate cortex reduced anxiety-related behavior , and microinjection into the primary somatosensory cortex significantly attenuated thermal hyperalgesia .

17948876|Activation of group II metabotropic glutamate receptors -LRB- mGluR2/3 -RRB- in the amygdala plays a critical role in the regulation of fear and anxiety states .

17947358|Dysregulation of neuronal crh expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus correlates with some forms of depression , and amygdalar crh expression may modulate levels of anxiety .

17942736|Progesterone , or rather its neuroactive metabolite allopregnanolone , modulates amygdala activity and thereby influences anxiety .

17935799|Thus , whereas stimulation of 5-HT 1A or 5-HT2 receptors in the limbic forebrain -LRB- amygdala , hippocampus -RRB- enhances anxiety-like responding in rodents , activation of corresponding receptor populations in the midbrain periaqueductal grey -LRB- PAG -RRB- more often than not reduce anxiety-like behaviour .

17920642|Furthermore , our findings are consistent with theories implicating amygdala-mediated over-arousal and anxiety in the development of these social-perceptual deficits .

17920243|Exposure to the holeboard induced activation in multiple brain regions previously implicated in anxiety-like behavior , including the lateral septum -LRB- LS -RRB- , paraventricular -LRB- PVN -RRB- and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei -LRB- DMH -RRB- , basolateral and central nuclei of the amygdala -LRB- BLA , CEA -RRB- , bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BST -RRB- and periaquiductal grey -LRB- PAG -RRB- , compared to homecage controls .

17908266|Flumazenil treatment of the amygdala during the first 2 withdrawals blocked the development of sensitized anxiety seen during a third withdrawal .

17908177|Here , we report that protein kinase C epsilon -LRB- PKCepsilon -RRB- null mutant mice , which show reduced anxiety-like behavior , have reduced levels of CRF messenger RNA and peptide in the amygdala .

17908177|Local knockdown of amygdala PKCepsilon by RNA interference reduced anxiety-like behavior in wild-type mice .

17908177|Furthermore , local infusion of CRF into the amygdala of PKCepsilon -LRB- - / - -RRB- mice increased their anxiety-like behavior .

17908177|These results are consistent with a novel mechanism of PKCepsilon control over anxiety-like behavior through regulation of CRF in the amygdala .

17904655|The purpose of the current study was to relate basal corticotropin-releasing factor -LRB- CRF -RRB- mRNA level in the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- with anxiety-like behavior using three strains of rat reported to exhibit a range of behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to stress .

17904218|As the amygdala formation has been implicated in generation of emotional states such as anxiety , we tested the effect of CCK on spontaneous synaptic events in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- using whole cell patch recordings in rat brain slice preparation .

17902000|Further , therapy-related reductions in experienced somatic anxiety symptoms were positively correlated with activation decreases in the amygdala and the insula .

17898336|Hyperactivation in the amygdala and insula were , of interest , more frequently observed in social anxiety disorder and specific phobia than in PTSD .

17898152|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is a major emotional center in the brain and regulates the expression of both learned fear and anxiety .

17882402|Relation of predator odour-induced anxiety to the inhibition of the EC system in the amygdala and PAG is supported by behavioural studies where blockade of CB1 receptors by rimonabant induces anxiogenic-like action .

17879281|The basolateral nuclear complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLC -RRB- receives a dense serotonergic innervation that appears to play a critical role in the regulation of mood and anxiety .

17846152|The complex connections between the orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala , as well as other areas involved in emotion , suggest important implications for the role of the orbitofrontal cortex in anxiety disorders , in which emotional expression is not appropriate to the situation .

17825840|While the histological basis for GMC changes in adult clinical populations is poorly-known at present , the observed pattern is consistent with the direction of change , in animal models of anxiety and depression , of neuronal number and/or morphological complexity in both the amygdala -LRB- where it is increased -RRB- and ACC -LRB- where it is decreased -RRB- .

17823306|KORs and their endogenous ligand dynorphin are expressed throughout brain areas involved in fear and anxiety , including the extended amygdala .

17764810|Neuroscience research indicates that individual differences in anxiety may be attributable to a neural system for threat-processing , involving the amygdala , which modulates attentional vigilance , and which is more sensitive to fearful than angry faces .

17762514|In this study Sprague-Dawley rats were microinfused with allopregnanolone into the amygdala , medial prefrontal cortex , or hippocampus -- brain regions that have been previously implicated in the control of anxiety in animal models .

17710250|Compared to wild-type mice , mice lacking apoE and apoE4 mice showed pathological alterations in the central nucleus of the amygdala , which is involved in regulation of anxiety .

17692344|We investigated the effect on rat anxiety behavior of local administration of THC in the prefrontal cortex , basolateral amygdala and ventral hippocampus , brain regions belonging to the emotional circuit and containing high levels of CB1 receptors .

17692344|Our results suggest that while a mild activation of CB1 receptors in the prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus attenuates anxiety , a slight CB1 receptor stimulation in the amygdala results in an anxiogenic-like response .

17683799|It has been shown that facilitation of GABA-mediated neurotransmission in the medial nucleus of the amygdala and the dorsal periaqueductal gray -LRB- dPAG -RRB- inhibits the escape , but not the inhibitory avoidance response generated in the elevated T-maze test of anxiety -LRB- ETM -RRB- .

17666080|Previous research has demonstrated that suppression of inhibition in projection neurons of the basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- represents an essential mechanism underlying the emergence of negative emotional responses , including exaggerated fear and anxiety .

17637604|We studied the involvement of cocaine - and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide -LRB- CART -RRB- in the central nucleus of amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNSTl -RRB- and nucleus accumbens shell -LRB- AcbSh -RRB- in generation of ethanol withdrawal symptoms , with particular focus on anxiety-like behavior using a social interaction test .

17637475|Consistent with these anxiolytic-like effects , in vivo microdialysis showed that acute galnon -LRB- 3mg/kg , i.p. -RRB- treatment preferentially elevated levels of GABA in the rat amygdala , a brain area linked to fear and anxiety behaviors .

17604649|The level of reported anxiety during the exposure to slim bodies correlated with established measures of shape and weight concern and with brain activations in bilateral basal ganglia , left amygdala , bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate , and left inferior lateral prefrontal cortex .

17598644|These experiments suggest that rapid neurotransmitters changes observed in the nucleus accumbens and amygdala , are possibly related to immobility and emotional states such as anxiety , aversion and/or depression caused by pain .

17595018|A functional MRI study of amygdala responses to angry schematic faces in social anxiety disorder . .

17595018|Neuroimaging studies using angry or contemptuous human facial photographic stimuli have suggested amygdala hyper-responsivity in social anxiety disorder -LRB- SAD -RRB- .

17573822|In Apoe - / - mice , chronically decreased histamine levels and reduced histamine release in the amygdala might contribute to increased measures of anxiety .

17566766|As anxiety level increased across participants , right and left auditory cortical as well as right amygdala activity increased to stimulus deviance .

17553730|Recent neuroimaging studies of conditioned fear , attention to threat and interpretation of emotionally ambiguous stimuli indicate common amygdala-prefrontal circuitry underlying these processes , and suggest that the balance of activity within this circuitry is altered in anxiety , creating a bias towards threat-related responses .

17550594|Pain-related anxiety-like behavior requires CRF1 receptors in the amygdala . .

17550594|The amygdala plays an important role in affective states and disorders such as anxiety and depression .

17550594|However , the involvement of the amygdala in the interaction of pain and anxiety remains to be determined .

17550594|This study tested the hypothesis that CRF1 receptors in the amygdala are critically involved in pain-related anxiety .

17550594|This study shows for the first time that CRF1 receptors in the amygdala contribute critically to pain-related anxiety-like behavior and nocifensive responses in a model of arthritic pain .

17550594|The results are a direct demonstration that the clinically well-documented relationship between pain and anxiety involves the amygdala .

17545449|The right amygdala volume was negatively correlated with visual new learning and not related to depression , anxiety , irritability , agitation or apathy at baseline or 12-month follow-up .

17537966|Here , we show , using a translational approach in mice and humans , that unpredictability per se without interaction with motivational information is sufficient to induce sustained neural activity in the amygdala and to elicit anxiety-like behavior .

17537966|In humans , functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that temporal unpredictably causes sustained neural activity in amygdala and anxiety-like behavior as quantified by enhanced attention toward emotional faces .

17515109|In addition , the past sensory stimulation in the amygdala , regarded as the center of anxiety , and the reinforcement of emotional ties is pointed out as an important thing for anxiety formation .

17513029|The present findings suggest that the anxiolytic-like effect of betaxolol on cocaine-induced anxiety may be related to its effect on amygdalar beta -LRB- 1 -RRB- - adrenergic receptors that are up-regulated during early phases of drug withdrawal .

17512918|CRF -LRB- 1 -RRB- receptor-specific antagonists , administered systemically , and CRF receptor subtype nonspecific antagonists , administered into the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , selectively decrease the anxiety-like behaviors and increased ethanol self-administration associated with ethanol withdrawal .

17507102|Although recent work on amygdalar function has concentrated on a role in fear and anxiety , a possible role in reward processes continues to be considered .

17469914|The amygdala and subgenual anterior cingulate -LRB- AC -RRB- have been associated with anxiety and mood disorders , for which trait neuroticism is a risk factor .

17459372|In addition , restraint led to significant increases of c-Fos expression in several brain regions related to stress or anxiety including paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus -LRB- PVN -RRB- , lateral hypothalamic area -LRB- LH -RRB- , central amygdaloid nucleus -LRB- CeA -RRB- , medial amygdaloid nucleus -LRB- MeA -RRB- and cingulate and retrosplenial cortices -LRB- Cg/RS -RRB- , paraventricular thalamic nucleus -LRB- PVT -RRB- , and basolateral amygdaloid nucleus -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

17451451|Specific neural substrates underlying the 5-HT -LRB- 2C -RRB- R KO anxiolytic phenotype were investigated , and we report that 5-HT -LRB- 2C -RRB- R KO mice display a selective blunting of extended amygdala corticotropin-releasing hormone neuronal activation in response to anxiety stimuli .

17426483|Given the role of the basolateral amygdala in anxiety and the expression of alpha1 , alpha2 and alpha3 subunits in this region , we also assessed the effects of bilateral infusion of L838 ,417 and midazolam directly into basolateral amygdala in the conditioned emotional response test .

17397999|Left amygdalar creatine concentration correlated positively with measures of anxiety and negatively with amygdalar volume .

17392412|A major site of extrahypothalamic expression of CRF and its G-protein-coupled receptors is the amygdala , a key player in affect-related disorders such as anxiety .

17390317|For those words , high recall performance and low anxiety ratings were associated with enhanced activity in the midbrain dopaminergic centers , the hippocampus , and the amygdala .

17389060|We have previously found that the anticipation of anxiety causes increases of respiratory frequency , and that these increases are related to an activation of the temporal pole and amygdala in humans .

17376704|Perturbations in amygdala function are evident in adolescents temperamentally at risk for anxiety .

17376149|Microinjection of an ENT1-specific antagonist , nitrobenzylthioinosine -LRB- nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside -RRB- , into the amygdala of C57BL/6J mice reduced anxiety-like behavior in the open field and elevated plus maze .

17376149|These findings show that amygdala ENT1 modulates anxiety-like behavior .

17360582|Other behaviors were not affected , thus revealing specific roles for amygdala OTR in female social recognition potentially mediated by anxiety in a social context .

17347454|Corticosteroid receptor-mediated mechanisms in the amygdala regulate anxiety and colonic sensitivity . .

17347454|Our previous studies have shown that stereotaxic implantation of corticosterone -LRB- Cort -RRB- onto the central amygdaloid nucleus increases both anxiety and colonic sensitivity .

17347454|The goal of this study was to examine the relative importance of amygdaloid glucocorticoid -LRB- GR -RRB- and mineralocorticoid receptor -LRB- MR -RRB- - mediated mechanisms in the induction of anxiety and colonic hypersensitivity .

17309774|The presence of serotonin 1A receptor -LRB- 5-HT -LRB- 1A -RRB- - R -RRB- in the hippocampus , amygdala , and most regions of the frontal cortex is essential between postnatal day-5-21 -LRB- P5-21 -RRB- for the expression of normal anxiety levels in adult mice .

17287821|In order to elucidate the neuroanatomical substrates underlying the effect of the maximal effective dose of THC , we investigated cFos expression in anxiety-related brain regions -LRB- prefrontal cortex , nucleus accumbens , amygdala , and hippocampus -RRB- of rats exposed to the EPM .

17280513|Using functional magnetic resonance imaging , we examined whether individual differences in amygdala activation in response to negative relative to neutral information are related to differences in the speed with which such information is evaluated , the extent to which such differences are associated with medial prefrontal cortex function , and their relationship with measures of trait anxiety and psychological well-being -LRB- PWB -RRB- .

17280513|Individual differences in trait anxiety did not predict variation in judgment time or in amygdala or ventral ACC activity .

17277936|From anxiety to autism : spectrum of abnormal social behaviors modeled by progressive disruption of inhibitory neuronal function in the basolateral amygdala in Wistar rats . .

17277936|The amygdala is a key brain region involved in social behaviors , and amygdala pathology has been implicated in disease states ranging from social anxiety disorder to autism .

17275189|We therefore explored ALLO effects on GABA neurotransmission in the central nucleus -LRB- Ce -RRB- of the amygdala , a major output nucleus involved in fear and anxiety .

17267796|Increased amygdala and insula activation during emotion processing in anxiety-prone subjects . .

17267796|Increased amygdala reactivity during processing of certain types of emotional stimuli -LRB- e.g. , fear , anger -RRB- has been observed in patients with anxiety disorders such as social phobia and posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- .

17267796|It is uncertain whether this heightened amygdala reactivity is specific to treatment-seeking patients with anxiety disorders or is a general feature of individuals with increased anxiety-related temperamental traits .

17267796|Anxiety-prone subjects had significantly greater bilateral amygdala and insula activation to emotional faces than did the anxiety-normative comparison subjects .

17267796|Higher scores on several measures assessing anxiety proneness -LRB- e.g. , neuroticism , trait anxiety , and anxiety sensitivity -RRB- were associated with greater activation of the amygdala -LRB- predominantly left-sided -RRB- and the anterior insula -LRB- bilateral -RRB- .

17267796|Increased amygdala and insula reactivity to certain types of emotional processing is seen in young adults with increased anxiety-related temperamental traits .

17245443|Increased anxiety-like behavior and enhanced synaptic efficacy in the amygdala of GluR5 knockout mice . .

17245443|GABAergic transmission in the amygdala modulates the expression of anxiety .

17245443|Understanding the interplay between GABAergic transmission and excitatory circuits in the amygdala is , therefore , critical for understanding the neurobiological basis of anxiety .

17245443|Here , we used a multi-disciplinary approach to demonstrate that GluR5-containing kainate receptors regulate local inhibitory circuits , modulate the excitatory transmission from the basolateral amygdala to the central amygdala , and control behavioral anxiety .

17245443|Genetic deletion of GluR5 or local injection of a GluR5 antagonist into the basolateral amygdala increases anxiety-like behavior .

17245443|Our results suggest that GluR5 is a key regulator of inhibitory circuits in the amygdala and highlight the potential use of GluR5-specific drugs in the treatment of pathological anxiety .

17240844|Both clinical studies and animal studies have indicated that the amygdala plays an essential role in anxiety and fear response .

17239834|Our results suggest that several amygdala nuclei , the PAG , and the BNST , where predator stress changes pCREB-lir in a NMDA receptor-dependent manner , are candidate areas of neuroplastic change contributing to lasting changes in anxiety-like behaviors .

17207866|Strychnine and taurine modulation of amygdala-associated anxiety-like behavior is ` state ' dependent . .

17207866|Furthermore , our findings also suggest that compounds acting at amygdala strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors may actively modulate this basal anxiety-like state .

17207863|Although systemic studies with 5-HT -LRB- 2 -RRB- receptor agonists and antagonists suggest a facilitatory role for this receptor subtype in anxiety , somewhat inconsistent results have been obtained when such compounds have been directly applied to limbic targets such as the hippocampus and amygdala .

17207863|However , when injected into the amygdaloid complex , the dose of 1.0 nmol of this 5HT -LRB- 2B/2C -RRB- receptor agonist increased behavioural indices of anxiety without significantly altering general activity levels .

17207863|These data suggest that 5HT -LRB- 2C -RRB- receptors located within the amygdaloid complex -LRB- but not the dorsal or ventral hippocampus -RRB- play a facilitatory role in plus-maze anxiety in mice .

17199059|To determine whether attention modulates amygdala and cortical responses to facial-threat cues differentially in adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder and in healthy adolescents .

17168841|In particular , the SERTPR insertion/deletion polymorphism has been related to hippocampal volume and amygdala response and it has been found to influence anxiety-related personality traits and anxiety disorders ; in mood disorders it showed some influences on age at onset , periodicity , illness recurrence , rapid cycling , antidepressants response and depressive reaction to stressful life events .

17156697|However , the existing literature on human psychiatry and behavior supports our reported evidence for a neurobiologic relationship between symptoms of anxiety and depression with amygdala structure and function .

17156370|Synchronized and rhythmic activity within the amygdala is thought to play a pivotal role in the generation of fear - and anxiety-related behaviour .

17138863|Region of interest analyses revealed that m-CPP and FG-7142 significantly increased BOLD signals in brain regions that have been linked to anxiety , including the amygdala , dorsal hippocampus , and medial hypothalamus .

17133262|Apart from the amygdala , the hippocampus , another limbic structure , also seems to be engaged in regulation of anxiety .

17131200|The genetics that underlie variation in amygdala structure may be coupled to variation in levels of aggression , fear , anxiety , and affiliated behaviors .

17116372|To develop a preclinical rodent model to study mechanisms underlying human BI and anxiety , we examined the extent to which ferret exposure elicits anxiety-related BI and HPA and amygdala activation of the CRF system .

17116372|In rodents , ferret exposure can be used to elicit anxiety-related BI , which is associated with HPA and amygdala activation .

17116372|Since the amygdala and the CRF system have been implicated in adaptive and maladaptive anxiety responses in humans , these data support use of our rodent model to further investigate mechanisms underlying anxiety-related psychopathology in humans .

17113944|Exposure to high - and low-light conditions in an open-field test of anxiety increases c-Fos expression in specific subdivisions of the rat basolateral amygdaloid complex . .

17113944|Anxiety states and anxiety-related behaviors appear to be regulated by a distributed and highly interconnected system of forebrain structures including the basolateral amygdaloid complex -LRB- basolateral amygdala -RRB- .

17113944|Despite a wealth of research examining the role of the basolateral amygdala in anxiety-related behaviors and anxiety states , the specific subdivisions of the basolateral amygdala that are involved in responses to anxiogenic stimuli have not been examined .

17113944|These findings point toward anatomical and functional heterogeneity within the basolateral amygdaloid complex and an important role of the anterior part of the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus in the neural mechanisms underlying physiological or behavioral responses to this anxiety-related stimulus .

17099900|NPSR mRNA is expressed in several regions mediating anxiety responses , including the amygdaloid complex and the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus .

17048126|Pathophysiological alterations in neuronal excitability in the amygdala are characteristic features of certain psychiatric illnesses , such as anxiety disorders and depressive disorders .

17020774|To examine its anxiolytic-like effects , the basolateral amygdala was chosen as an injection site , as this brain region is involved in the regulation of anxiety-related behavior .

17004937|Evidence suggests that the ` anxiety-like ' behaviour and stress associated with protracted withdrawal may be mediated by increased corticotropin-releasing factor -LRB- CRF -RRB- in the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , a part of the limbic circuitry engaged in the coding and transmission of stimulus-reward associations .

16979909|Recent research has examined anxiety and hyperactivity in the amygdala and the anterior hippocampus while processing aversive stimuli .

16979422|Repeated stress in animal models causes brain regions involved in memory and emotions , such as hippocampus , amygdala , and prefrontal cortex , to undergo structural remodeling with the result that memory is impaired and anxiety and aggression are increased .

16979141|The lower 5-HT1A binding in the amygdala and mesiofrontal areas of SAD patients is consistent with 1 -RRB- preclinical findings of elevated anxiety in 5-HT1A knockout mice , 2 -RRB- a previous PET study in healthy volunteers showing an inverse correlation between 5-HT1A BP and state anxiety , and 3 -RRB- another human PET study in patients with panic disorder showing reduced 5-HT1A binding , thus corroborating the potential validity of 5-HT1A receptors as targets in the treatment of human anxiety disorders .

16972100|A growing number of studies have found evidence that anxiety and depressive disorders are associated with atypical amygdala hyperactivation , which decreases with effective treatment .

16962717|Recently identified cellular and molecular correlates of stress-induced plasticity suggest a putative link between neuronal remodeling in the amygdala and the development of anxiety-like behavior .

16962717|Rodent models of immobilization stress , applied for 10 consecutive days , have been reported to enhance anxiety , and also cause dendritic elongation and spine formation in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

16956980|Building on these accounts , prominent models have suggested that anxiety modulates the output of an amygdala-based preattentive threat evaluation system .

16956980|Under low perceptual load , elevated state anxiety was associated with a heightened response to threat distractors in the amygdala and superior temporal sulcus , whereas individuals high in trait anxiety showed a reduced prefrontal response to these stimuli , consistent with weakened recruitment of control mechanisms used to prevent the further processing of salient distractors .

16950220|There was a negative correlation in the right , but not left , amygdala between subjective anxiety ratings and NK1 tracer binding .

16941481|The present findings showing that RIS induces a sustained increase of CRH expression in the central extended amygdala suggest that the repeated activation of CRH neurons and CRH receptors in the central extended amygdala may underlie the long-lasting anxiety behavior induced by RIS .

16924103|We find that transgenic overexpression of the neurotrophin BDNF has an unexpected facilitatory effect on anxiety-like behavior , concomitant with increased spinogenesis in the basolateral amygdala .

16924103|Thus , structural changes in the amygdala and hippocampus , caused by genetic manipulation of the same molecule BDNF , give rise to contrasting effects on anxiety and depressive symptoms , both of which are major behavioral correlates of stress disorders .

16919528|Results are discussed in the context of the amygdala 's role in rapid threat detection and the vigilance-avoidance hypothesis of anxiety .

16914953|Behavioral measures of anxiety and motor activity in open field were examined in mice given localized injections of 0 , 2 , 8 or 32 nmol of midazolam directed into the amygdala or hippocampus .

16897598|Levels of neurotrophic factors in the hippocampus and amygdala correlate with anxiety - and fear-related behaviour in C57BL6 mice . .

16897598|The magnitude of anxiety-like behaviour in the elevated plus maze was positively related to dorsal hippocampal BDNF levels , but negatively related to NGF levels in dorsal hippocampus and in the amygdala .

16897598|Moreover , a distinction between spontaneous and learned -LRB- or conditioned -RRB- anxiety/fear would be relevant to the identification of neurotrophin signalling mechanisms in the hippocampus and amygdala implicated in anxiety and related psychopathology .

16895832|The amygdala plays a critical role in generating the emotion of fear , and alterations in amygdala fear processing are thought to underlie the acquisition and maintenance of anxiety disorders .

16880223|In contrast , stimulations of the left amygdala were able to induce either pleasant -LRB- happiness -RRB- or unpleasant -LRB- fear , anxiety , sadness -RRB- emotions .

16879790|Evidence showing a dissociation of both BI and trait anxiety from the amygdala is considered .

16879790|The need to critically examine the role of the amygdala in BI and trait anxiety , as well as to consider other brain areas that appear to be involved in subserving these emotional traits , is emphasized .

16869228|Recently , functional neuroimaging has provided dramatic illustrations of how a promoter polymorphism in the human serotonin transporter gene , which has been weakly related to several dimensions of emotional behaviors -LRB- such as neuroticism and anxiety traits -RRB- , is strongly related to the engagement of neural systems -- namely , the amygdala and subgenual prefrontal cortex , subserving emotional information processing .

16860404|Differential effects of embryo transfer and maternal factors on anxiety-related behavior and numbers of neuropeptide Y -LRB- NPY -RRB- and parvalbumin -LRB- PARV -RRB- containing neurons in the amygdala of inbred C3H/HeN and DBA/2J mice . .

16860404|The effects of reciprocal embryo transfers were studied on anxiety-related behavior of inbred C3H/HeN and DBA/2J mice on the elevated plus maze -LRB- EPM -RRB- , and related to amygdaloid neuropeptide Y -LRB- NPY -RRB- - and parvalbumin -LRB- PARV -RRB- - immunoreactive neurons .

16817878|The role of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 in the modulation of anxiety has been studied in this region by microinjection of small volumes of the mGluR5 antagonist 2-methyl-6 -LRB- phenylethenyl -RRB- pyridine -LRB- MPEP -RRB- , with restricted diffusion from its injection site , into the rostral amygdala near the basolateral and central amygdaloid nuclei and the intercalated islands , and the behavior of the animals was evaluated using three non-conditioned models of anxiety .

16806522|In the last years , the role played by the medial nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- MeA -RRB- in the modulation of fear - and anxiety-related behaviors has been increasingly investigated .

16767411|These results are consistent with the involvement of 5-HT2C receptors in the amygdala and 5-HT1A autoreceptors in the dorsal raphe nucleus in repeated ethanol withdrawal-induced sensitization of anxiety-like behavior .

16740316|Correlation analyses revealed that larger left amygdala volumes were significantly related to worse memory performance and to higher anxiety scores of depressive subjects .

16721035|Inhibition of CRH expression in amygdala suggests that the stress inflicted is of physical but not of psychological nature and could lead to reduced fear or anxiety .

16697979|NPW-ir fibers were most abundantly observed in the central amygdaloid nucleus and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis , which are regions implicated in fear and anxiety .

16670653|For children with VCFS , but not for the comparison sample , larger volumes of the amygdala and smaller ratios of prefrontal cortex to amygdala were associated with higher scores on the Internalizing , Externalizing , Anxiety , and Aggression scales of the Child Behavior Checklist and on the parent version of the Young Mania Rating Scale .

16651400|Because lateral/basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- GABA -LRB- A -RRB- receptors help regulate anxiety-like behaviors , we have tested the hypothesis that differences in receptor function/expression may be related to strain-specific differences in experimentally measured anxiety .

16647726|In addition , chronic pain patients have an increased incidence of depression and anxiety , stress-related disorders that are frequently accompanied by disturbances in the limbic system -LRB- e.g. hippocampus and amygdala -RRB- and the HPA axis .

16639185|These findings are in agreement with several neurological and psychological studies suggesting that hyper-reactivity in the amygdala corresponds to a constellation of symptoms of anxiety in posttraumatic stress disorder , while the lowered activation of the prefrontal and the anterior cingular cortex could reflect slower extinction of a conditioned emotional response .

16634847|The current experiment investigated the predictive role of anxiety-like behaviors in ethanol self-administration and the relationship of NPY in the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- with anxiety and ethanol self-administration .

16624666|Evidence has demonstrated that the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is particularly associated with defensive behavior that involves the emotional states of fear and anxiety .

16624666|In addition , some reports have demonstrated that serotonin -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- released in the amygdala is increased during states of stress and anxiety , principally in the BLA .

16611092|Pharmacological and genetic studies in rodents have shown that GRPRs in brain areas such as the dorsal hippocampus and amygdala are importantly involved in regulating synaptic plasticity and aspects of behavior that might be altered in disorders such as anxiety , schizophrenia , depression , autism and dementia .

16595858|The low-expressing allele of the 5-HTT promoter polymorphism -LRB- HTTLPR -RRB- is associated with anxiety and with greater amygdala and other regional responses to emotional .

16580757|The amygdala is integral to anxiety , fear , and related psychiatric diseases .

16580153|Lack of cortical input to the amygdala impairs the perpetrator 's ability to extinguish anxiety and/or conditioned fear and gives rise to either innate behaviors -LRB- e.g. , fight , flight , and shut down -RRB- or learned fear avoidant behaviors designed to avoid anxiety -LRB- e.g. , alcohol consumption , self-injurious acts , and obsessive behaviors -RRB- .

16554740|A review and update of mechanisms of estrogen in the hippocampus and amygdala for anxiety and depression behavior . .

16554740|Brain targets for E2 's effects on anxiety and depression include the hippocampus and amygdala .

16554740|Administration of E2 , compared to vehicle , subcutaneously or to the hippocampus or amygdala of ovariectomized rats decreases anxiety and depressive behavior .

16554740|Administration of an ER antagonist to the hippocampus , but not amygdala , increases anxiety and depression behavior of naturally receptive female rats .

16546144|The results suggest that understanding the ways in which the amygdala modulates arousal may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying altered sleep in mood and anxiety disorders .

16525417|The observed social anxiety-related changes in distributed neural activity are consistent with cognitive models of SAD and adaptive decreases in amygdala activity in response to social anxiogenics , and support the association of altered frontal cortical responses with treatment response .

16500019|We present evidence indicating that the rodent amygdala is involved in some types of fear -LRB- conditioned fear -RRB- , but not all types -LRB- unconditioned fear -RRB- , and may therefore have significance for a differential neurobiology of certain anxiety disorders in humans .

16494851|The high levels of NK -LRB- 1 -RRB- receptor binding in the amygdala as well as preclinical studies demonstrating increased release of substance P and corresponding internalisation of NK -LRB- 1 -RRB- receptors in the basolateral amygdala in response to stressful stimuli suggest that the BLA may represent a potential site of action for NK -LRB- 1 -RRB- receptor antagonists in anxiety and/or depression .

16492400|Using a novel attentional manipulation in conjunction with fMRI , we showed that emotion-related amygdala activity was modulated by attention , but that the degree of such modulation correlated with the personality variable harm avoidance , associated with trait anxiety .

16488545|Injections of urocortin 1 into the basolateral amygdala induce anxiety-like behavior and c-Fos expression in brainstem serotonergic neurons . .

16488545|The amygdala plays a key role in emotional processing and anxiety-related physiological and behavioral responses .

16488545|Previous studies have shown that injections of the anxiety-related neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor or the related neuropeptide urocortin 1 into the region of the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus induce anxiety-like behavior in several behavioral paradigms .

16488545|Brainstem serotonergic systems in the dorsal raphe nucleus and median raphe nucleus may be part of a distributed neural system that , together with the basolateral amygdala , regulates acute and chronic anxiety states .

16488545|These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the basolateral amygdala and serotonergic neurons within the midbrain raphe complex are part of an integrated neural system modulating anxiety state .

16487156|The involvement of GABA -LRB- A -RRB- receptors in fear extinction in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala is of particular interest , because of the role of these areas in emotional processes , and the role of the GABA -LRB- A -RRB- receptors in anxiety states .

16482088|Since the amygdala CRF system mediates stress - and anxiety-related behaviors and alterations in amygdala function are associated with psychopathology , we examined amygdala CRF-BP gene expression in post-mortem brains from subjects with major depression , bipolar disorder , and schizophrenia as well as in controls .

16470804|Based on the anxiety and depression literatures , we predicted correlations with a network of brain structures , including ventral and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- encompassing anterior cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex -RRB- , insular cortex , anterior temporal pole , ventral striatum , and the amygdala .

16460693|Emotional disorders such as depression and anxiety have been associated with hyperactivity of the amygdala , but it is unknown whether antidepressant treatment directly affects amygdala responses to emotionally significant information .

16458953|The effects of 12 weeks of social isolation , in adult rats , on anxiety-related behaviors and central concentrations of NPY in : hypothalamus , amygdala , caudate-putamen , hippocampus , and frontal cortex were evaluated .

16423710|Role of stress , corticotrophin releasing factor -LRB- CRF -RRB- and amygdala plasticity in chronic anxiety . .

16423710|Within the amygdala , the basolateral nucleus -LRB- BLA -RRB- has an important role in regulating anxiety and affective responses .

16423710|This review summarizes some of the data supporting the hypotheses that stress induced plasticity within the amygdala may be a critical step in the pathophysiology of the development of chronic anxiety states .

16407893|Using immunohistochemistry , the expression of a powerful anxiolytic molecule neuropeptide Y -LRB- NPY -RRB- was determined on postnatal day -LRB- PN -RRB- 20 in the hippocampus and basolateral amygdala -LRB- structures related to anxiety and fear -RRB- of the offspring .

16402133|The neuropeptide substance P -LRB- SP -RRB- , encoded by the preprotachykinin-A -LRB- PPTA -RRB- gene , is expressed in the central and medial amygdaloid nucleus , where it plays a critical role in modulating fear and anxiety related behaviour .

16402133|Determining the regulatory systems that support PPTA expression in the amygdala may provide important insights into the causes of depression and anxiety related disorders and will provide avenues for the development of novel therapies .

16396741|The central amygdala contains numerous neurotransmitter systems that have been implicated in the regulation of anxiety-like behavior , including corticotropin releasing factor -LRB- CRF -RRB- and NMDA-type glutamate receptors .

24921677|Noradrenaline modulates the activity of brain regions such as the amygdala which are associated with anxiety .

16351838|The amygdala is considered a core structure of the so-called limbic system and has been implicated in a variety of functions , including emotional interpretation of sensory information , emotional arousal , emotional memory , fear and anxiety , and related clinical disorders .

16314872|Animal studies have implicated GAL in alcohol abuse and anxiety : chronic ethanol intake increases hypothalamic GAL mRNA ; high levels of stress increase GAL release in the central amygdala .

16303186|While there is abundant evidence for a role of 5-HT and the amygdala in anxiety and depression , the role of 5-HT in this brain region in schizophrenia is less well understood .

16286816|The effects of histaminergic agents in the central amygdala of rats in the elevated plus-maze test of anxiety . .

16286816|The amygdala is an important brain site in the modulation of fear or anxiety .

16286816|In the present study , we investigated the effects of intracentral amygdala microinjection of histaminergic agents on anxiety-related behaviours in rats , using the elevated plus-maze test of anxiety .

16286816|Intracentral amygdala microinjection of pyrilamine -LRB- H1 receptor antagonist -RRB- and ranitidine -LRB- H2 receptor antagonist -RRB- -LRB- both at 1-20 microg/0 .5 microl bilateral -RRB- did not change anxiety-related parameters in our experiments .

16286816|The results suggest that histamine may modulate anxiety via H1 but not H2 receptors in the rat central amygdala .

16256956|Association between amygdala hyperactivity to harsh faces and severity of social anxiety in generalized social phobia . .

16256956|Previous functional brain imaging studies of social anxiety have implicated amygdala hyperactivity in response to social threat , though its relationship to quantitative measures of clinical symptomatology remains unknown .

16256956|The primary aim of this study was to examine the association between response to emotionally harsh faces in the amygdala , a region implicated in social and threat-related processing , and severity of social anxiety symptoms in patients with generalized social phobia -LRB- GSP -RRB- .

16256956|Relative to happy faces , activation of the amygdala in response to harsh -LRB- angry , disgusted , fearful -RRB- faces was greater in GSP patients than in controls , and the extent of amygdala activation was positively correlated with severity of social anxiety symptoms , but not general state or trait anxiety levels .

16256956|Our findings suggest that amygdala activation to interpersonal threat can be specifically linked to the severity of social anxiety symptoms of individual GSP patients , and thus , may serve as a useful functional marker of disease severity .

16237681|Previously , we showed that enhancing stress-activation of the noradrenergic system by yohimbine pretreatment released galanin in central amygdala , attenuating the anxiety-like behavioral response to stress on the elevated plus-maze .

16220340|Greater incidence of anxiety and depressive disorders of women compared to men may be due in part to progesterone -LRB- P -RRB- and its neuroactive metabolite , 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one -LRB- 3alpha,5alpha-THP -RRB- , acting in limbic regions , such as the amygdala .

16200210|Deficits in amygdaloid cAMP-responsive element-binding protein signaling play a role in genetic predisposition to anxiety and alcoholism . .

16200206|The anxious amygdala : CREB signaling and predisposition to anxiety and alcoholism . .

16200206|The amygdala is believed to play a key role in assigning emotional significance to specific sensory input , and conditions such as anxiety , autism , stress , and phobias are thought to be linked to its abnormal function .

16200206|In this issue of the JCI , Pandey and colleagues identify a central amygdaloid signaling pathway involved in anxiety-like and alcohol-drinking behaviors in rats .

16200206|They report that decreased phosphorylation of cAMP responsive element-binding protein -LRB- CREB -RRB- resulted in decreased neuropeptide Y -LRB- NPY -RRB- expression in the central amygdala of alcohol-preferring rats , causing high anxiety-like behavior .

16190788|This study examines the relationship between face-emotion recognition and anxiety in a sample of children and adolescents participating in a brain-imaging study of amygdala structure and function .

16190788|Reduced accuracy on a face-emotion recognition test is consistent with perturbed amygdala function in pediatric anxiety disorders .

16190788|As this study was conducted in a sample undergoing a neuroimaging investigation of amygdala integrity , future analyses will examine associations among amygdala function , clinical anxiety , and face-recognition abilities .

16189475|Social anxiety predicts amygdala activation in adolescents viewing fearful faces . .

16189475|The amygdala is critically involved in the processing of anxiety in adults , but little is known about the neurogenesis of trait-anxiety during adolescence .

16189475|We correlated amygdala activity during visual presentations of fearful and happy faces with scores on the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children in 16 adolescents undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging .

16189475|During fear perception , amygdala activity positively correlated with several social dimensions of anxiety , including peer rejection , humiliation , performing in public , and being separated from loved ones , but was not correlated with most measured nonsocial dimensions of anxiety .

16189475|During adolescence , amygdala activity appears to be more strongly related to social/interpersonal than nonsocial dimensions of anxiety .

16185722|Other research finds that anxiogenic drugs working through various mechanisms induce IEG expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- suggesting that expression is a neural marker for fear and anxiety .

16182456|Though both the amygdala and the serotonin system appear to play critical roles in regulating fear and anxiety , little is known regarding the organization of serotonergic inputs to the primate amygdala .

16154203|In addition to investigating normal synaptic function , this preparation provides opportunities to investigate this synapse in animals which have received drugs chronically or have been manipulated genetically to model specific mental diseases known to involve prefrontal cortex and/or amygdala pathology -LRB- e.g. , schizophrenia , addiction , anxiety , and depression -RRB- .

16133141|The current study was performed to : -LRB- 1 -RRB- further investigate the effects of 5-HT2 receptor activation in rats exposed to the elevated plus-maze -LRB- EPM -RRB- and the open-field arena , two widely used animal models for studying anxiety and locomotor activity ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- evaluate the involvement of the 5-HT2 receptors within the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- in the modulation of such effects .

16123756|Chronic pain induces anxiety with concomitant changes in opioidergic function in the amygdala . .

16039621|Higher psychic -LRB- beta > or = .63 -RRB- and lower somatic -LRB- beta < or = -.70 -RRB- anxiety predicted over 50 % of the variance in 5-HT1A BP in multiple cortical regions , but not in amygdala , hippocampus , or autoreceptors of the raphe nuclei .

15970947|In the brains of these rats , withdrawal anxiety was accompanied by increased -LSB- 3H -RSB- Ro48 8587 binding in the hippocampus and thalamus , and decreased GluR1 and GluR2 subunit mRNA expression in the amygdala -LRB- GluR1 and GluR2 -RRB- and cortex -LRB- GluR1 -RRB- .

15960305|Our study was intended to compare c-fos gene expression in amygdala , the key structure in anxiety/fear regulation , in old -LRB- 24 months -RRB- and young -LRB- 4 months -RRB- rats exposed to various behavioral stimulations .

15950774|Therefore , we asked in this double-blind study whether elevated plus-maze behavior may also be related to endogenous levels of cytokine mRNA in other brain regions , which play a role for anxiety , namely the amygdala , hippocampus , and the prefrontal cortex .

15931675|Thus , the present study adds novel evidence further supporting that the BNST and the central nucleus of the amygdala form part of an adrenal steroid-sensitive extrahypothalamic circuit that has been involved in fear and anxiety responses and in clinical syndromes such as melancholic depression , posttraumatic stress disorders , and addiction .

15931063|Panic disorder patients showed appreciably high state anxiety before scanning , and exhibited significantly higher levels of glucose uptake in the bilateral amygdala , hippocampus , and thalamus , and in the midbrain , caudal pons , medulla , and cerebellum than controls .

15927407|The amygdala is a brain area which plays a decisive role in fear and anxiety .

15916857|Retrograde tracing methods revealed that DRDSh contains large numbers of neurons projecting to the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus , a forebrain structure important for emotional appraisal and modulation of anxiety-related physiological and behavioral responses .

15894059|It is conceivable that the lesions to the limbic structures involved in the origin of emotions ; the hippocampus , amygdala , and piriform cortex , may underlie changes in anxiety reactions in SRS rats .

15880108|Carriers of the short allele of a functional 5 ' promoter polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene have increased anxiety-related temperamental traits , increased amygdala reactivity and elevated risk of depression .

15877308|In long-term depressive illness , the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex undergo atrophy , whereas the amygdala is hyperactive in anxiety and mood disorders and may undergo a biphasic change in structure -- increasing in size in acute depression and shrinking on long-term depression .

15877308|In animal models of acute and chronic stress , neurons in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex respond to repeated stress by showing atrophy that leads to memory impairment , whereas neurons in amygdala show a growth response that leads to increased anxiety and aggression .

15867950|Moreover , amygdala-kindled rats , which have a lowered threshold for neuronal activation , also display enhanced anxiety-like responses .

15862523|Interaction between neuropeptide Y and alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone in amygdala regulates anxiety in rats . .

15862523|We were interested in studying the interaction between these two peptides in the regulation of anxiety , within the framework of amygdala .

15862523|These results suggest that endogenous alpha-MSH and NPY containing systems may interact in the amygdala and regulate exploratory behavior in an animal model of anxiety .

15860335|Selective reduction in amygdala volume in pediatric anxiety disorders : a voxel-based morphometry investigation . .

15860335|Reductions in left amygdala gray matter volume were noted for patients with anxiety disorders relative to comparison subjects .

15853569|There is increasing evidence that brain areas involved in the stress response , including prefrontal cortex , hippocampus and amygdala , play a role in the symptoms of anxiety .

15816943|Neuronal loss in regions mediating memory and anxiety , such as hippocampus , entorhinal cortex , and amygdala , may relate to impaired spatial orientation and decreased anxiety .

15814569|Hyperactivity of the amygdala has been described in clinical and preclinical studies of anxiety , and therefore , neuronal Kv7 channels may be a relevant target for this indication .

15802499|In accordance with increased anxiety , CRH contents in the hypothalamus and amygdala were significantly higher in these mice .

15770236|The first experiment determined if herpes virus-mediated alterations in amygdalar NPY levels would alter anxiety-related behaviors in the elevated plus maze .

15770236|Experiment 2 was conducted to provide further evidence for a role of amygdalar NPY in regulating anxiety-related behaviors in the elevated plus maze test .

15770236|The results of these experiments provide further support for the role of amygdalar NPY in anxiety-related behaviors .

15755522|The effect of acupuncture on anxiety and neuropeptide Y expression in the basolateral amygdala of maternally separated rats . .

15755522|Their anxiety-like behavior was evaluated using an elevated plus-maze at P62 , and then NPY immunohistochemistry in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- was performed .

15755522|These findings suggest that acupuncture treatment might reduce anxiety-like behavior in adult rats following maternal separation by modulating the NPY system in the amygdala .

15753241|A large body of evidence suggests that the amygdala and associated limbic structures play a critical role in the expression of anxiety and may be treatment targets for anxiolytic drugs .

15741749|Disgust sensitivity and trait anxiety were positively , and independently from each other , correlated with the activation of the right amygdala .

15740845|As dopaminergic transmission within the amygdala may play a role in anxiety , the effect of the D1 antagonist SCH23390 microinjected mainly close to the rostral intercalated islands in rats was studied , using the White and Black Box test .

15740845|It is suggested that blockade of D1 receptors in the rostral intercalated islands may reduce anxiety through a reduction of GABA-mediated dishinibition of the central amygdaloid nucleus .

15733549|Previous studies in our lab have shown that Urocortin infused into the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala produces anxiety-like responses in the social interaction test .

15733093|It is suggested that these cellular mechanisms contribute to the role of somatostatin in decreasing anxiety behaviour as well as to anticonvulsant and antiepileptogenic actions of somatostatin or somatostatin agonists in the amygdala .

15699291|To examine the effects of 5-HTTLPR genotype on the reactivity of the human amygdala to salient environmental cues with functional magnetic resonance imaging in a large -LRB- N = 92 -RRB- cohort of volunteers carefully screened for past and present medical or psychiatric illness , and to explore the effects of 5-HTTLPR genotype as well as amygdala reactivity on harm avoidance , a putative personality measure related to trait anxiety .

15673443|It is well established that the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CEA -RRB- is involved in responses to stress , fear and anxiety .

15669223|Recently it has been suggested that the combination of SSRI and benzodiazepine is rational , because each drug has a different mechanism of action , the benzodiazepine enhancing GABAergic transmission , the SSRIs stimulating the 5-HT1A receptor that may inhibit the postsynaptic neuronal excitability in the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex that comprise the brain circuit of fear and anxiety .

15669223|Recent Imaging studies suggested the hyperactivity of the amygdala in the patients with generalized social anxiety disorder and successful treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy or SSRI might significantly reduce the hyperactivity of the amygdala .

15662083|Two brain structures are particularly engaged in a regulation of anxiety , namely the amygdala and also the hippocampus .

15659301|Emotions such as fear and anxiety are mediated by a neural network containing nuclei like the amygdala , the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the periaqueductal gray .

15659301|We suggest that there is rather a neurochemical than a neuroanatomical dissociation between learned fear and anxiety as hypothesized by Walker and Davis -LRB- Walker , D.L. and M. Davis , 1997b , Double dissociation between the involvement of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the central nucleus of the amygdala in startle increases produced by conditioned versus unconditioned fear , J. Neurosci .

15621024|The input from the medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus -LRB- MGN -RRB- to the lateral amygdala is known to be important in the regulation of fear and anxiety .

15607294|When correcting for anxiety and depressive symptoms , we additionally found a reduced responsiveness of the left amygdala to negative pictures in patients compared with control subjects .

15603746|Individual differences in trait anxiety predict the response of the basolateral amygdala to unconsciously processed fearful faces . .

15603746|Whereas activation of the dorsal amygdala by conscious stimuli was consistent across subjects and independent of trait anxiety , activity in the basolateral amygdala to unconscious stimuli , and subjects ' reaction times , were predicted by individual differences in trait anxiety .

15601600|Contrary to findings in other anxiety disorders , there was no observed increase in amygdala responsivity to fearful versus neutral human faces in OCD as compared with healthy control subjects .

15601600|Therefore , the present findings are consistent with abnormal amygdala function in OCD and are of a character that may distinguish OCD from other anxiety disorders .

15598549|Regression analyses demonstrated that state anxiety was correlated with activity in left amygdala , bilateral perirhinal cortex , right FG , and periaquaductal grey ; by contrast , phobic fear was only associated with right-sided hippocampal activity .

15598549|Analyses of covariance suggest a further functional segregation with state anxiety being linked to enhanced activity in amygdala , perirhinal cortex , and tegmentum , and phobic fear with enhanced right hippocampal activity , suggesting a neuroanatomical differentiation between emotional-vegetative and cognitive aspects of -LRB- phobic -RRB- fear .

15598155|Recent studies have identified putative cellular correlates of stress-induced amygdalar plasticity underlying anxiety-like behavior .

15598155|Thus , consolidation of anxiety may share common cellular mechanisms that also underlie chronic stress-induced structural plasticity in the amygdala .

15550348|The amygdala , a structure that plays a critical role in fear learning , is also an important target of anxiety and stress .

15550347|Cognitive and neurophysiological studies have shown that HC-PFC processing is impaired , and amygdaloid processing is enhanced , by stress and in anxiety and mood disorders , including MDD .

15548650|State anxiety modulation of the amygdala response to unattended threat-related stimuli . .

15548650|Here , we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging study with 27 healthy volunteers to examine whether amygdala responsivity to unattended threat-related stimuli varies with individual differences in state anxiety .

15548650|These findings suggest that anxiety may interact with attentional focus to determine the magnitude of the amygdala response to threat-related stimuli .

15537900|Finally , neither chronic P replacement nor acute THP affected fear-potentiated startle , suggesting that P metabolites have an effect on the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and anxiety rather than on the amygdala and stimulus-specific fear .

15525282|Mice displaying high TMT-induced LD anxiety exhibited increased ENK-positive neurons in the BLA , CEA and medial amygdaloid nuclei relative to mice that displayed low anxiety-like behavior in the LD test after TMT exposure .

15522965|Tissue plasminogen activator promotes the effects of corticotropin-releasing factor on the amygdala and anxiety-like behavior . .

15522965|We have previously demonstrated that tissue plasminogen activator -LRB- tPA -RRB- in the amygdala promotes stress-induced synaptic plasticity and anxiety-like behavior .

15476706|Corticotropin-releasing factor gene expression is down-regulated in the central nucleus of the amygdala of alcohol-preferring rats which exhibit high anxiety : a comparison between rat lines selectively bred for high and low alcohol preference . .

15464275|Recovery after chronic stress fails to reverse amygdaloid neuronal hypertrophy and enhanced anxiety-like behavior . .

15464275|Recent reports have identified cellular and molecular correlates of stress-induced amygdaloid plasticity that may underlie anxiety .

15464275|At the cellular level , we tested if CIS-induced dendritic remodeling in the amygdala is also as long-lasting as enhanced anxiety after 21 days of recovery .

15464275|Indeed , long-lasting facilitation of CIS-induced anxiety is accompanied by a persistent increase in dendritic arborization of basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- spiny neurons .

15464275|These findings on persistent dendritic remodeling in the amygdala , in addition to highlighting important differences with hippocampal structural plasticity , may provide a cellular basis for examining anxiety and mood disorders triggered by chronic stress .

15341600|The crucial role of the amygdala for the mediation of anxiety is in agreement with the part that alpha2-subunit-containing GABA A receptors play in anxiolysis and their important function in this area of the brain .

15336949|These results suggest that the anxiolytic effect of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor in conditioned fear is mediated by its effect in the amygdala , and support the hypothesis of serotonin function in anxiety by which facilitation of serotonin neurotransmission decreases anxiety .

15336519|The challenge condition was associated with activation in both right superior temporal sulcus and right amygdala , which might relate to increased social vigilance and anxiety , respectively .

15291242|Recently it has been suggested that the combination of SSRI and benzodiazepine is rational , because each drug has a different mechanism of action , the benzodiazepines enhancing GABAergic transmission , and the SSRIs stimulating the 5-HT1A receptor that may inhibit the postsynaptic neuronal excitability in the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex that comprise the brain circuit of fear and anxiety .

15291242|Recent imaging studies suggested the hyperactivity of the amygdala in the patients with generalized social anxiety disorder and successful treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy or SSRI might significantly reduce the hyperactivity of the amygdala .

15280440|We have recently demonstrated that chronic ethanol ingestion alters the functional and pharmacological properties of GABAA receptors measured in acutely isolated rat lateral/basolateral amygdala neurons , a limbic forebrain region involved with fear-learning and innate anxiety .

15271583|Effects of cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein overexpression in the basolateral amygdala on behavioral models of depression and anxiety . .

15271583|Chronic antidepressant administration increases the cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein -LRB- CREB -RRB- in the amygdala , a critical neural substrate involved in the physiologic responses to stress , fear , and anxiety .

15271583|To determine the role of CREB in the amygdala in animal models of depression and anxiety , a viral gene transfer approach was used to selectively express CREB in this region of the rat brain .

15271583|Expression of CREB in the basolateral amygdala also increased behavioral measures of anxiety in both the open field test and the elevated plus maze , and enhanced cued fear conditioning .

15271583|Taken together , these data demonstrate that CREB expression in the basolateral amygdala influences behavior in models of depression , anxiety , and fear .

15262319|Extinction deficit and fear reinstatement after electrical stimulation of the amygdala : implications for kindling-associated fear and anxiety . .

15245495|Does amygdaloid corticotropin-releasing hormone -LRB- CRH -RRB- mediate anxiety-like behaviors ?

15245495|The present study assessed anxiety-like responses and in vivo neurochemical alterations at the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- evoked by exposure to an unfamiliar -LRB- anxiogenic -RRB- environment .

15233764|Fear conditioning is a model of emotional memory and anxiety that is expressed as an enduring increase in synaptic strength in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- .

15213011|Reduced neuropeptide Y mRNA expression in the central nucleus of amygdala of alcohol preferring -LRB- P -RRB- rats : its potential involvement in alcohol preference and anxiety . .

15201323|The role of the central nucleus of the amygdala in mediating fear and anxiety in the primate . .

15201323|To examine the role of the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- in mediating the behavioral and physiological responses associated with fear and anxiety , we used rhesus monkeys to assess the effects of excitotoxic lesions of the CeA .

15163695|It was also found that CREB-deficient -LRB- + / - -RRB- mice displayed more anxiety-like behaviors and that acute ethanol exposure produced anxiolytic effects and significantly increased protein levels of p-CREB and NPY in the central and medial but not in the basolateral amygdala of wild-type mice , but these effects are attenuated in CREB-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice .

15158011|We studied amygdala activation during social anxiety provocation in relation to affective ratings and 5-HTT genetic variation .

15158011|-LSB- H2 -LRB- 15 -RRB- O -RSB- positron emission tomography was used to estimate amygdala blood flow during private and public speaking -LRB- baseline and anxiety conditions -RRB- in 17 patients with social phobia .

15158011|Individuals with one or two copies of the short allele exhibited significantly increased levels of anxiety-related traits , state anxiety , and enhanced right amygdala responding to anxiety provocation , compared with subjects homozygous for the long allele .

15114629|Microarray analysis revealed altered expression , in the amygdala of the Tg-APP -LRB- Sw , V717F -RRB- / B6 mice , of genes previously implicated in anxiety .

15114344|On the other hand , comorbid anxiety is related to impaired synaptic processes , which selectively gate fear -LRB- or aggressive -RRB- responses from the amygdala at the accumbens .

15114344|Impairment of this mechanism by lowered PFC inhibition allows greater amygdala input , and anxiety-related processes more impact , over the accumbens .

15113256|Estrogen and/or progesterone administered systemically or to the amygdala can have anxiety - , fear - , and pain-reducing effects in ovariectomized rats . .

15113256|Estrogen -LRB- E2 -RRB- and/or progesterone -LRB- P -RRB- in the amygdala may influence anxiety , fear , and pain behaviors .

15113256|Thus , E2 and P may have effects in the amygdala to decrease anxiety , fear , and/or pain responses .

15110733|Human amygdala responses during presentation of happy and neutral faces : correlations with state anxiety . .

15110733|Within the ventral amygdala , a negative correlation between happy versus neutral signal changes and state anxiety was observed .

15110733|Here , an observed relationship between state anxiety and ventral amygdala response to happy versus neutral faces was explained by response to neutral faces .

15089969|The medial amygdala is important for processing of psychogenic stress and anxiety and also contains oxytocin pathways and oxytocin receptors .

15075447|In contrast , in a women predominant population of IBS patients , we did not observed any neuronal activation in locations activated in healthy volunteers -LRB- ACC , dorsolateral PFC -RRB- while a significant deactivation was observed in the IC and in the amygdala , a limbic structure with a role to assign emotional significance to a current experience related to anxiety and fear .

15056457|To detect early signs of tau aggregate-associated changes , we investigated behavioral alterations and cognitive deficits in such mice using an amygdala-specific test battery for anxiety-related and cognitive behavior .

15044074|These data show that increased serotonin and glutamate tone and decreased gabaergic tone in the amygdala correlate to elevated fear and anxiety after prefrontal cortex ibotenic acid lesion .

15024126|Substance P in the medial amygdala : emotional stress-sensitive release and modulation of anxiety-related behavior in rats . .

14998885|To understand the brain mechanisms underlying adaptive anxiety responses and their physiological concomitants , a series of studies in monkeys lesioning components of the neural circuitry -LRB- amygdala , central nucleus of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex -RRB- hypothesized to play a role are currently being performed .

14998885|In preliminary FDG positron emission tomography -LRB- PET -RRB- studies , functional linkages were established between the amygdala and prefrontal cortical regions that are associated with the activation of anxiety .

14988500|The amygdala showed prominent expression , and overexpressing ASIC1a enhanced fear conditioning , an animal model of acquired anxiety .

14980379|Neonatal thyroxine treatment : changes in the number of corticotropin-releasing-factor -LRB- CRF -RRB- and neuropeptide Y -LRB- NPY -RRB- containing neurons and density of tyrosine hydroxylase positive fibers -LRB- TH -RRB- in the amygdala correlate with anxiety-related behavior of wistar rats . .

14980379|In the present study , the relationship between anxiety-related behavior and amygdala morphology was investigated in the adult rat after transient neonatal hyperthyroidism -LRB- daily s.c. injections of 7.5 microg L-thyroxine in 0.5 ml 0.9 % NaCl solution from postnatal day p1 to p12 -RRB- .

14980379|Thyroxine-treated adult animals displayed a reduced anxiety in the motility box and elevated plus maze , a reduction in the number of CRF-ir neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala , as well as an increase in the number of NPY-ir neurons and density of TH-ir fibers in nuclei of the basolateral complex of the amygdala .

14766647|This perspective predicts that hyperactivity of the amygdala would be associated with increased fear or anxiety and may contribute to disorders such as social phobia .

14766193|Here we asked whether prenatal stress also has an impact on the development of the amygdala , because this structure plays a direct role in the emotions of anxiety and fear .

14751419|In this study , male mice were injected with MDMA -LRB- 1 , 8 and 15 mg/kg ip -RRB- and assessed for changes on anxiety and for the expression of the immediate early gene c-fos in the amygdala -LRB- central , basolateral and basomedial -RRB- .

14729131|If disturbed , imbalanced information flow from the amygdaloid complex could yield obsessive-compulsive - and anxiety-disorders , which can be counteracted by blocking the information flow within the shell region of the accumbens nucleus by deep brain stimulation .

14706946|Self-reports of depressive symptoms and anxiety were measured , as were global and relative glucose metabolism in the orbitofrontal , cingulate , lateral prefrontal , and insular cortices and the amygdala , striatum , and cerebellum .

14706946|Abusers of MA provided higher self-ratings of depression and anxiety than control subjects and differed significantly in relative regional glucose metabolism : lower in the anterior cingulate and insula and higher in the lateral orbitofrontal area , middle and posterior cingulate , amygdala , ventral striatum , and cerebellum .

14706946|In MA abusers , self-reports of depressive symptoms covaried positively with relative glucose metabolism in limbic regions -LRB- eg , perigenual anterior cingulate gyrus and amygdala -RRB- and ratings of state and trait anxiety covaried negatively with relative activity in the anterior cingulate cortex and left insula .

14706946|Trait anxiety also covaried negatively with relative activity in the orbitofrontal cortex and positively with amygdala activity .

14706555|Furthermore , we reported that normalization of CREB phosphorylation by infusing protein kinase A -LRB- PKA -RRB- activator into the central amygdala prevents anxiety-like effects in rats during ethanol withdrawal .

14706555|These results suggest that the decreased cellular expression of NPY in the central amygdala may play an important role in the CREB-mediated regulation of anxiety-like behaviors during ethanol withdrawal .

14697239|Differential role of the hippocampus , amygdala , and dorsal raphe nucleus in regulating feeding , memory , and anxiety-like behavioral responses to ghrelin . .

14697239|We measured several behavioral parameters such as anxiety -LRB- elevated plus maze -RRB- , memory retention -LRB- step down test -RRB- , and food intake after injections of different doses of the peptide in the hippocampus , amygdala , and dorsal raphe nucleus -LRB- DRN -RRB- .

14660061|Rats selectively bred for amygdala excitability , realized by fast or slow kindling epileptogenesis , were previously reported to exhibit differential levels of anxiety .

14659479|The present study explored the role of neuroplasticity in PAG and its connection with the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- ACE -RRB- in male rodent anxiety-like response to predator stress .

14659475|Specifically , we demonstrate that -LRB- 1 -RRB- psychogenic stressors influence the in vivo release of CRH at the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- although CRH changes within the CeA are exquisitely sensitive to stressors , they are also elicited by positive stimuli ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- while treatment with diazepam attenuates behavioral signs of anxiety , the CRH release associated with a stressor is unaffected by the treatment .

14654092|Behavioral studies indicate that the amygdala plays a critical role in the anxiolytic effect of benzodiazepines -LRB- Nagy et al. , Neuropharmacology 18 -LRB- 1979 -RRB- 573 ; The amygdala : anxiety and benzodiazepines .

14638381|These data suggest that -LRB- i -RRB- the maternal deprivation induced changes are larger in males than in females , -LRB- ii -RRB- maternal deprivation induces a latent behavioral disposition towards anxiety that is precipitated by acute stressors , and -LRB- iii -RRB- the changes noticed in amygdalar CRH expression may serve as mechanisms for the behavioral changes noticed .

14625149|Contemporary neurobiological models suggest that the amygdala plays an important role in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders .

14622171|Moreover , considerable progress has been made recently in determining the specific neural pathways and systems underlying these actions , especially the role of noradrenergic projections from the nucleus of the tractus solitarius and the locus coeruleus to the amygdala in memory processes , and to the basal forebrain in the processing of anxiety-related information .

14614087|The amygdala plays a critical role in fear conditioning , a model of emotional learning and cue-induced anxiety .

14606694|If the amygdala is pathological in subjects with autism , it may contribute to their abnormal fears and increased anxiety rather than their abnormal social behavior .

14534353|Because amygdala NMDA receptors play a significant role in many learned fear behaviors , chronic ethanol-induced adaptations in these receptors may influence the expression of withdrawal anxiety .

14531157|Effects of left amygdala lesions on respiration , skin conductance , heart rate , anxiety , and activity of the right amygdala during anticipation of negative stimulus . .

14531157|The present study reports the effects of lesions in the left amygdala on anxiety , respiration , skin conductance , heart rate , and electrical potentials in the right amygdala in two patients .

14531157|Trait and anticipatory-state anxiety were measured before and after left amygdala resection to control medically intractable epilepsy in the patients .

14531157|Lesions in the left amygdala resulted in decreases of trait and state anxiety , respiratory rate , and activity in the right amygdala in both patients ; one patient also showed notable decreases in skin conductance and heart rate .

14531157|We suggest that the activity of the right amygdala is dominantly activated in anxiety and anxiety-related physiological responses but needs excitatory inputs from the left amygdala .

14529813|The amygdala is a brain region involved in the regulation of anxiety-related behavior .

14529813|The purpose of this study was to correlate anxiety-related behavior of inbred mouse strains -LRB- BA / / c , BALB/cJ , C3H/HeJ , C57BL/6J , CPB-K , DBA/2J , NMRI -RRB- to receptor binding in the amygdala .

14521193|The amygdala , autism and anxiety . .

14521193|If the amygdala is pathological in subjects with autism , it may contribute to their abnormal fears and increased anxiety rather than their abnormal social behaviour .

12967989|Neurokinin-1 receptor-expressing neurons in the amygdala modulate morphine reward and anxiety behaviors in the mouse . .

12967989|Subsequently , the effect of ablation of these neurons in the amygdala on anxiety behavior was assessed using the elevated plus maze -LRB- EPM -RRB- , before conditioned place preference -LRB- CPP -RRB- , and locomotor responses to morphine were measured .

12967989|Loss of NK1 receptor-expressing neurons in the amygdala caused an increase in anxiety-like behavior on the EPM .

12967989|These observations mirror those observed in NK1 receptor knock-out -LRB- NK1 - / - -RRB- mice and suggest that the amygdala is an important area for the effects of SP and the NK1 receptor in the motivational properties of opiates , as well as the control of behaviors related to anxiety .

12967770|Structures of the extended amygdala , particularly the central nucleus of amygdala , are involved in anxiety and in motivational aspects of alcohol drinking behaviors .

12967770|Therefore , decreased function of CREB in the central nucleus of the amygdala might regulate anxiety and alcohol intake via decreased expression of NPY , and might provide a common link between anxiety and alcohol abuse disorders .

12950435|The neuroanatomical basis of anxiety disorders is reviewed with particular focus on the amygdala and the temporal and prefrontal cortex .

12910346|Ample evidence implicates corticotropin-releasing factor -LRB- CRF -RRB- - producing neurons of the central amygdaloid nucleus -LRB- CeA -RRB- in vegetative , endocrine , and behavioral responses to stress and anxiety in laboratory rats .

12885424|Local injections of the neurotoxin SP-saporin into the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- are reported to specifically lesion substance P receptor immunoreactive -LRB- SPR-IR -RRB- interneurons , and to reduce anxiety related behavior .

12867498|The endocrine response is preferentially activated by GLP-1 administration in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus , whereas the anxiety response is preferentially activated by administration in the central nucleus of the amygdala .

12859347|Deletion of these receptors may result in enhanced release of NPY , GABA and/or glutamate in brain areas linked to the manifestation of anxiety , and stress-related behaviour such as the amygdala .

12804127|Increased amygdala : hippocampal volume ratios associated with severity of anxiety in pediatric major depression . .

12804127|Increased left and right amygdala : hippocampal volume ratios were associated with increased severity of anxiety but not increased severity of depression or duration of illness .

12804127|These results suggest that alterations in amygdala : hippocampal volume ratios in pediatric MDD may more reflect severity of associated anxiety than depression .

12790157|This paper focuses on the role of CCK in modulating anxiety-related and reward-related behaviours in key brain regions of the amygdala and mesolimbic dopamine system , respectively .

12790157|Evidence on the role of CCK in anxiety-related and reward-related behaviours in various animal models indicates that CCK-B receptors in the basolateral amygdala are important mediators of anxiety-related behaviours and that CCK-A and CCK-B receptors in the nucleus accumbens are important in mediating different aspects of reward-related behaviour .

12747942|The above data suggest that amygdalar CRF system activity is potently activated after administration of morphine and cocaine , and that activation of this system observed at the time of withdrawal from morphine may be responsible for aversion and anxiety related to these states ; therefore a CRF1 receptor may be a target for prospective pharmacotherapies of the withdrawal from abused drugs .

12724173|Neuroimaging studies of amygdala function in anxiety disorders . .

12724173|The amygdala is known to play an important role in normal fear conditioning and is implicated in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders .

12724173|The amygdala may also be a target for the beneficial effects of cognitive-behavioral and medication treatments for anxiety disorders .

12724173|In the current paper , we review neuroimaging research pertaining to the role of the amygdala in anxiety disorders and their treatment .

12724172|Brain imaging studies in mood and anxiety disorders : special emphasis on the amygdala . .

12724172|The present paper briefly summarizes the highlights of the different presentations , focusing on the functional diversity of the amygdala and its role in different neuropsychiatric disorders ; reviews the various brain imaging technologies currently available ; and discusses the major findings on the pathophysiology and treatment of depression , bipolar disorder , and anxiety disorders .

12724169|We reviewed and reanalyzed data from our laboratory , indicating that subjective feelings of fear and distress are correlated with regional cerebral blood flow -LRB- rCBF -RRB- in the right but not the left amygdala during anxiety provocation in individuals with social anxiety disorder , specific phobias .

12724169|However , because studies demonstrate that treatment of social anxiety disorder with cognitive behavior therapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors results in reduced rCBF in the amygdaloid complex and prospective studies reveal that treatment-induced alterations in amygdala rCBF can predict 1 year follow-up status in social anxiety disorder data support the notion that the amygdala , at least in part , seem casually involved in generating the subjective experience of fear .

12724167|The amygdala is implicated in a number of emotional responses including conditioned fear and anxiety , and it appears to regulate the behavioral and autonomic responses associated with such emotional responses .

12724167|The basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is under tonic GABAergic inhibition , and acutely blocking this inhibition results in increased anxiety-like behavior , conditioned avoidance , and sympathetically mediated cardiovascular activation .

12724164|Deficient inhibitory tone in the amygdala could lead to overexpression of conditioned responses , producing pathological states such as anxiety disorders and drug-seeking behavior .

12724164|Future therapies aimed at increasing inhibitory tone in the amygdala , either locally or via the prefrontal cortex , may prevent anxiety disorders and addiction relapse .

12724155|Fear conditioning , a behavioral model of fear learning and cue-related anxiety , causes enhanced neuronal transmission in the thalamic to lateral amygdala pathway .

12724155|These findings suggest that L-type calcium channels play a role in the amygdala in cued fear conditioning and have important implications in the treatment of anxiety and in emotional learning and plasticity .

12658105|The decreased phosphorylation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate -LRB- cAMP -RRB- response element binding -LRB- CREB -RRB- protein in the central amygdala acts as a molecular substrate for anxiety related to ethanol withdrawal in rats . .

12658105|This study investigated the molecular mechanisms in the amygdaloid neurocircuitry governing anxiety related to ethanol withdrawal and also the phenomenon of alcohol preference .

12658105|We also investigated the effects of manipulation of the phosphorylation status of CREB in the central amygdala by infusion of the PKA activator -LRB- Sp-cAMPS -RRB- or inhibitor -LRB- Rp-cAMPS -RRB- on anxiety levels in rats during ethanol withdrawal .

12658105|When Sp-cAMPS is specifically infused into the central amygdala , it dose-dependently normalizes the decrease in CREB phosphorylation and prevents the development of anxiety in rats during ethanol withdrawal .

12658105|On the other hand , Rp-cAMPS infusions into the central or basolateral amygdala decrease CREB phosphorylation , but only infusion into the central amygdala provokes anxiety and increases alcohol preference in normal rats .

12658105|These novel results suggest the possibility that decreased CREB phosphorylation in the central amygdala acts as a common molecular correlate for anxiety and alcohol-drinking behaviors and also is correlated with anxiety related to ethanol withdrawal .

12644353|Anxiety related to different symptom dimensions was associated with different patterns of activation : provocation of washing-relevant anxiety predominantly activated dorsal and ventral prefrontal regions ; checking-relevant anxiety predominantly activated dorsal prefrontal regions ; and hoarding-relevant anxiety predominantly activated ventral prefrontal regions and the left amygdala .

12600711|Role of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis versus the amygdala in fear , stress , and anxiety . .

12600706|Different serotonergic pathways are likely to be involved in the mediation of the anxiolytic-like response , e.g. the pathway ascending from the dorsal raphe nucleus through the medial forebrain bundle to the amygdala and frontal cortex mediating conditioned/learned anxiety and another pathway ascending from the dorsal raphe nucleus to the periaqueductal grey mediating unconditioned/fight flight anxiety .

12591150|A differential role has been suggested for two important areas in the neural circuitry of stress , central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- and bed nucleus of stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- in the extended amygdala , in regulating fear versus anxiety .

12526985|The PBN , with its reciprocal relationships with the extended central amygdaloid nucleus , infralimbic cortex , and hypothalamus , appears to be an important node in a primary network that processes convergent vestibular , somatic , and visceral information processing to mediate avoidance conditioning , anxiety , and conditioned fear responses .

12524546|Tissue plasminogen activator in the amygdala is critical for stress-induced anxiety-like behavior . .

12514197|Muscimol , a GABA -LRB- A -RRB- receptor agonist , was injected -LRB- 4.4 nmol/0 .5 microl -RRB- into the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- as well as into the amygdala , two brain areas known to be involved in anxiety and fear .

12488535|If fear memory is expressed by a long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- of synaptic transmission in the amygdala , then reversal of LTP -LRB- depotentiation -RRB- in this area of the brain may provide an important mechanism for amelioration of anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder .

12467878|Serotonin -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- is considered to play a significant role in anxiety-related behaviors in animals through actions on the amygdaloid complex .

12460694|We speculate that anticipatory anxiety in social phobics originates in an affect sensitive fear network encompassing the amygdaloid-hippocampal region , prefrontal , and temporal areas .

12404082|Decreased CCK -LRB- B -RRB- receptor binding in rat amygdala in animals demonstrating greater anxiety-like behavior . .

12404082|The potentiation of the acoustic startle response -LRB- ASR -RRB- by stimuli associated with aversive events is mediated via the amygdala and is used as an index of '' anxiety '' and '' fear '' .

12404082|In laboratory animals , cholecystokinin -LRB- B -RRB- -LRB- CCK -LRB- B -RRB- -RRB- agonists increase anxiety and fear and activation of amygdala CCK -LRB- B -RRB- receptors potentiates ASR .

12404082|To investigate the putative role of CCK -LRB- B -RRB- receptors in individual differences in fear and anxiety , we examined individual differences in amygdala CCK -LRB- B -RRB- receptor binding for animals demonstrating low versus high baseline and fear-potentiated ASR .

12404082|Animals with high anxiety-like responses on the EPM showed decreased CCK -LRB- B -RRB- binding in the basolateral , but not central , amygdala .

12404082|These results show that there is a down-regulation of amygdala CCK -LRB- B -RRB- receptor binding in animals demonstrating greater anxiety-like responding in the fear-potentiated ASR and EPM models of anxiety , possibly as a compensation for increased CCK activity .

12373778|The posterior basolateral nucleus of the amygdala is known to mediate fear and anxiety and is important in assigning emotional valence to cognitive processes .

12213511|For this reason , we examined APX rats in the open field test , which is a standard measure of anxiety - or fear-related behavior and also investigated NPY mRNA levels in the hippocampus , amygdala and hypothalamus .

22034090|This pattern predicts shy behavior in preschool children and symptoms of social anxiety at age 7 , and , at age 11 , a subdued personality and biological features that are consonant with a hypothesis of amygdalar excitability .

12196604|Rat lines selectively bred for differences in amygdala excitability , manifested by '' fast '' or '' slow '' kindling epileptogenesis , display several comorbid features related to anxiety and learning .

12167256|It is thought that the human amygdala is a critical component of the neural substrates of emotional experience , involved particularly in the generation of fear , anxiety , and general negative affectivity .

12130784|Serotonin -LSB- 5 - hydroxytryptamine , -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- -RSB- function influences normal fear as well as pathological anxiety , behaviors critically dependent on the amygdala in animal models and in clinical studies .

12130784|We now report that individuals with one or two copies of the short allele of the serotonin transporter -LRB- 5-HTT -RRB- promoter polymorphism , which has been associated with reduced 5-HTT expression and function and increased fear and anxiety-related behaviors , exhibit greater amygdala neuronal activity , as assessed by BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging , in response to fearful stimuli compared with individuals homozygous for the long allele .

12130784|These results demonstrate genetically driven variation in the response of brain regions underlying human emotional behavior and suggest that differential excitability of the amygdala to emotional stimuli may contribute to the increased fear and anxiety typically associated with the short SLC6A4 allele .

12114004|During anticipatory anxiety we found hypoactivity in the precentral gyrus , the inferior frontal gyrus , the right amygdala , and the anterior insula in PD patients compared to control subjects .

12076734|Thus , the hypothalamic and the amygdaloid CRH systems cooperatively constitute stress-responsive , anxiety-producing neurocircuitry during chronic stress , which is responsible for the clinical manifestations of stress-associated disorders .

12046982|The amygdala is known to be involved in the expression of emotion such as anxiety and fear , and several studies have shown that the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- is involved in morphine dependence .

12027115|Awareness that an amygdala-based fear circuit plays a crucial role in mediating fear conditioning as well as anxiety symptoms is growing .

11982631|Contribution of amygdala neurons containing peptides and calcium-binding proteins to fear-potentiated startle and exploration-related anxiety in inbred Roman high - and low-avoidance rats . .

11982631|The purpose of this study was to investigate amygdala-related fear and anxiety in two inbred rat lines differing in emotionality -LRB- RHA/Verh and RLA/Verh -RRB- , and to relate the behaviour of the animals to neuronal types in different nuclei of the amygdala .

11982446|Common sites of action for citalopram and cognitive-behavioral treatment of social anxiety were observed in the amygdala , hippocampus , and neighboring cortical areas , ie , brain regions subserving bodily defense reactions to threat .

11853101|In addition , intracerebroventricular administration of GLP-1 has been shown to suppress locomotor activity , and produce a neuronal activation in the amygdala , a structure involved in mechanisms of fear and anxiety .

11844573|Lesioning on day 7 resulted in behavioural changes , interpreted as locomotor stereotypy and decreased anxiety in case of amygdala or hippocampus , respectively .

11844471|This unexpected anxiolytic effect of 5-HT -LRB- 1A -RRB- autoreceptor blockade in the MRN can not be accounted for by a disinhibition of 5-HT release in forebrain targets -LRB- e.g. hippocampus and amygdala -RRB- , where stimulation of postsynaptic 5-HT -LRB- 1A -RRB- receptors enhances anxiety-like responses .

11830177|Leptin suppression of hypothalamic NPY expression and feeding , but not amygdala NPY expression and experimental anxiety . .

11786194|CRF and neuropeptide Y -LRB- NPY -RRB- produce reciprocal effects on anxiety in the central nucleus of the amygdala .

11695953|Alterations in amygdala function have been implicated in the pathophysiological characteristics of adult anxiety and depressive disorders .

11695953|We hypothesized that children with anxiety and depression may show atypical amygdala responses to emotional stimuli .

11695953|Children with anxiety disorders showed an exaggerated amygdala response to fearful faces compared with healthy children , whereas depressed children showed a blunted amygdala response to these faces .

11695953|In addition , the magnitude of the amygdala 's signal change between fearful and neutral faces was positively correlated with the severity of everyday anxiety symptoms .

11695953|Our results suggest that amygdala function is affected in both anxiety and depression during childhood and adolescence .

11748741|Abnormalities of other brain structures -LRB- e.g. , amygdala , brainstem nuclei -RRB- may account for the significantly higher anxiety scores differentiating GTS from HD patients .

11730710|Kindling of the amygdaloid complex in rats results in an enhanced emotionality frequently expressed by an elevated anxiety and defensive attitude toward other animals .

11720732|This held equally true for anxiety-related brain structures -LRB- e.g. central nucleus of the amygdala , periaqueductal gray and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus -RRB- and reward-related sites -LRB- nucleus accumbens and pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus -RRB- .

11677270|Neuropeptide Y -LRB- NPY -RRB- and GABA are thought to interact functionally in the amygdala , and this interaction may be important in the regulation of anxiety .

11668663|Finally we illustrate the application of these rules by two examples : a -RRB- amygdala activation , a biological alteration shared by anxiety disorders and major depression and b -RRB- elevated plasma soluble interleukin 2 receptor , an unshared property by anxiety disorders and major depression .

11593044|Behavior consistent with increased anxiety was observed principally in ERbeta mutant females and was associated with a reduced threshold for the induction of synaptic plasticity in the basolateral amygdala .

11566217|Neuroanatomical and behavioral studies have demonstrated that the amygdaloid complex is an essential component of the neural pathways mediating behaviors , such as fear , anxiety , learning , and memory .

11481154|Increased anxiety was accompanied by enhanced rCBF in the amygdaloid complex in the social phobics relative to the comparison subjects .

11430862|Lines of rats selectively bred for amygdala excitability , as reflected by kindling rates in response to electrical stimulation , also exhibit differences in tests of anxiety .

11033344|Taken together , these findings suggest that the increased release of noradrenaline in the hypothalamus , amygdala and locus coeruleus is , in part , involved in the provocation of anxiety and/or fear in animals exposed to stress , and that the attenuation of this increase by benzodiazepine anxiolytics acting via the benzodiazepine receptor/GABAA receptor/chloride ionophore supramolecular complex may be the basic mechanism of action of these anxiolytic drugs .

11011014|The amygdala is important in processing emotion and in the acquisition and expression of fear and anxiety .

10913507|Although these data are preliminary and from a small sample , the results are consistent with a line of thinking that alterations in the structure and function of the amygdala may be associated with pediatric generalized anxiety disorder .

10890308|The aim of the present review is to provide an overview of the effects of different acute and repeated/chronic stressors on serotonin -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- release and reuptake , extracellular 5-HT levels , and 5-HT pre - and postsynaptic receptors in areas tightly linked to the control of fear and anxiety , namely the dorsal and median raphe nuclei , the frontal cortex , the amygdala and the hippocampus .

10783146|The higher responsiveness of amygdaloid neurons in transgenic rats as well as the predominance of inhibitory effects , presumedly mediated by GABAergic interneurons , could change the output of the amygdala and its influence on thirst , kidney , and cardiovascular function or on processes of learning and anxiety .

10780249|Here we tested whether anxiety and increased amygdalar stimulation may play a role in eliciting or exacerbating such behaviors .

10780249|Furthermore , yohimbine , a drug that induces both amygdalar stimulation and behavioral indicators of anxiety , exacerbated abnormal leaping in D1CT mice but failed to exacerbate their abnormal behavioral perseverance .

10780249|These data suggest that chronic potentiation of D1 + neurons in the amygdalar ICN increases anxiety and facilitates particular compulsive behaviors .

10760490|Taken together , these findings support the involvement of the amygdala in anxiety-like behaviors in response to chronically elevated corticosterone and suggests that elevated glucocorticoids may increase anxiety by inducing CRF expression in the CeA .

10638633|These results suggest that the trait anxiety -LRB- neophobia -RRB- that characterizes BALB/c mice could be due , at least in part , to a genetic modulation of benzodiazepine receptor expression in the amygdala , a structure known to be strongly involved in fear behavior .

10634350|The functional anatomy of anxiety involves amygdala-based neurocircuits with critical reciprocal connections to the medial prefrontal cortex .

11124977|An animal model most sensitive for measuring anticipatory anxiety is fear conditioning , which is expressed by an enduring increase in synaptic strength in the amygdala .

10619632|A strong -LRB- r = 0.86 , p < 0.003 -RRB- correlation exists between increased anxiety -LRB- more time spent in the closed arm -RRB- and the lateralization of serotonin in the amygdala .

10619632|Greater serotonin in the right versus left amygdala relates to greater anxiety .

10619632|These data support the hypothesis that the right hemisphere is involved in emotional states : increased serotonin in the right amygdala is related to anxiety , while cortical dopamine may be associated with attention to the environment .

10599479|Moreover , CRF has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of anxiety disorders , mainly through CRF neurocircuits connecting the amygdala and the locus ceruleus .

10595427|In the present study , the implication of the amygdala , a key structure in mechanisms of fear and anxiety , was investigated as a potential neural substrate for the effects of neurosteroids on anxiety-like behavior in rat .

10595427|Animals implanted with bilateral cannulae aimed at the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- and infused with neurosteroids , were tested in two animal models of anxiety .

10559431|Enhanced amygdala kindling after electrical stimulation of the ventral tegmental area : implications for fear and anxiety . .

10559379|The amygdala is intimately involved in emotional behavior , and its role in the generation of anxiety and conditioned fear is well known .

10549813|A single 1 h restraint increases experimental anxiety in the elevated plus-maze through actions within the amygdala , while intra-amygdala administration of neuropeptide Y -LRB- NPY -RRB- has the opposite effect .

10549813|Endogenous amygdala NPY expression is suppressed by single restraint , providing a possible mechanism for the anxiety-promoting action of this stressor .

10542960|The contribution of the amygdala , a key region involved in the control of anxiety , is also demonstrated for the anxiolytic action of allopregnanolone .

10486901|The hyperactivation of the amygdala resulted in a long-lasting -LRB- at least for 3 weeks -RRB- increase in the locomotor activity against the background and deficit in exploratory behavior and rise of the level of anxiety and fear .

10481834|The amygdala is known to play a central role in mechanisms of fear and anxiety .

10481834|We therefore examined the effects of galanin -LRB- 0.2 and 0.6 nmol/side -RRB- on experimental anxiety upon microinjection into the amygdala .

10481834|These data suggest that activation of galanin receptors in amygdala modulates neurotransmission involved in fear and experimental anxiety .

10463635|These findings suggest a possible dissociation between anxiety and pain perception with an important -LRB- nonaffective -RRB- role for the amygdala in the latter .

10430478|In humans , the amygdaloid region may also be involved in co-ordinating falls in cutaneous blood flow occurring in response to salient or anxiety-evoking stimuli .

10430478|Thus , discovery of the neural pathways by which amygdaloid circuitry alters ear pinna blood flow in rabbits may elucidate the manner in which similar cardiovascular changes occur in humans during anxiety reactions .

10415655|The extended amygdala : are the central nucleus of the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis differentially involved in fear versus anxiety ? .

10415655|Because this information may be less specific and of long duration , activation of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis may mediate anxiety , whereas activation of the central nucleus of the amygdala may mediate stimulus-specific fear .

10397286|Together , the findings support the notion that NPY agonists that would enhance NPY function in the amygdala might be useful for the treatment of anxiety and alcoholism .

10381597|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- ABL -RRB- nuclei contribute to the process of anxiety .

10322186|Particular emphasis has been placed on the prefrontal cortex , anterior cingulate , parietal cortex , and the amygdala as critical components of the circuitry that may be dysfunctional in both depression and anxiety .

10231807|The finding that anxiety was the most common experiential phenomenon produced by electrical stimulation of amygdala and hippocampus with depth electrodes points in this direction .

10230072|The aim of the present study is to examine the effects of serotonin synthesis inhibition with p-Chlorophenylalanine -LRB- p-CPA -RRB- in rats on -LRB- 1 -RRB- anxiety behavior examined in the light-dark crossing test and , -LRB- 2 -RRB- regional brain concentration of monoamines -LRB- NA , DA and 5-HT -RRB- and their metabolites -LRB- MHPG , DOPAC , HVA and 5-HIAA -RRB- as well as GABA in the hypothalamus , amygdala , hippocampus , midbrain central gray matter and the frontal cortex .

9926822|The authors compared two rat strains , selectively bred for their susceptibility to amygdala kindling , with respect to their performance on various behavioral and learning tasks that are associated with fear and anxiety .

9926822|Further , these observations imply that the relatively constrained excitability of the amygdala network in the SLOW rats might mediate their relatively greater expression of fear and anxiety compared with the FAST rats .

9861467|Are different parts of the extended amygdala involved in fear versus anxiety ? .

9861467|Somewhat less explicit information , such as that produced by exposure to a threating environment for several minutes or by intraventricular administration of the peptide corticotropin-releasing hormone may activate a brain area closely related to the amygdala , called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis , which in turn activates hypothalamic and brain stem target areas involved in specific signs of fear or anxiety .

9802416|The present findings support the hypothesis that anxiety related behavioral effects of stress may in part be mediated through modulation of NPY function in the amygdala .

9801965|The present article presents an integrative theory that explains how and why cognitive misinterpretations and '' false threat alarms '' leading to irrational fear and anxiety can arise from a neurobiological dysfunction in the amygdala and ascending transmitter systems .

9668628|Cocaine withdrawal elicited anxiety-like behavior and alterations of CRF concentration in the hypothalamus , amygdala , and basal forebrain .

9588484|To investigate further , the behavioral effects of BNST lesions were compared to those of septal and amygdaloid lesions in 2 models of rat anxiety : the plus-maze and shock-probe tests .

9579794|It is noteworthy that although interleukin-1beta and tumour necrosis factor-alpha provoked an anxiogenic response in the elevated plus maze test of anxiety , neither cytokine significantly altered amygdaloid noradrenergic or serotonergic activity , as many previous studies have implicated increased amygdaloid noradrenergic and/or serotonergic activity in the pathophysiology of anxiety .

9577241|Pathological anxiety is conceptualized as an exaggerated fear state in which hyperexcitability of fear circuits that include the amygdala and extended amygdala -LRB- i.e. , bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -RRB- is expressed as hypervigilance and increased behavioral responsivity to fearful stimuli .

9549309|Together with the finding that increases , in noradrenaline release are closely related to the provocation of anxiety and/or fear , ethanol , in part , reduced tension , as mentioned in the tension reduction hypothesis , by attenuating stress-induced increases in noradrenaline release in the amygdala and locus coeruleus .
