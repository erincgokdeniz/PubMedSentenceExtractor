25298173|To the best of our knowledge , this study is to compare neural activity between the left and right amygdalae in people with depression .

25278754|Proton magnetic spectroscopy was performed in 29 participants with a first episode of moderate depression occurring in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left amygdala at baseline and after 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment with escitalopram .

25278754|This study could not confirm any significant changes in NAA after antidepressant treatment in the first episode of moderate depression , or in regard to therapy response in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or left amygdala .

20159144|Abnormal left and right amygdala-orbitofrontal cortical functional connectivity to emotional faces : state versus trait vulnerability markers of depression in bipolar disorder . .

18717711|In right TLE patients , left and right amygdala activation was significantly related to preoperative anxiety and depression levels , and preoperative right amygdala activation correlated significantly with postoperative change of anxiety and depression scores , characterized by greater increases in anxiety and depression in patients with greater preoperative activation .

17010993|Hamilton depression scores of the patients correlated positively with activation of the left and right ventral amygdala during expectation of negative stimuli .

12804127|Increased left and right amygdala : hippocampal volume ratios were associated with increased severity of anxiety but not increased severity of depression or duration of illness .
