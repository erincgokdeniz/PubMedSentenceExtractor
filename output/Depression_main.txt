26541813|The results suggest that left amygdala hyperactivity during negative autobiographical recall is a trait-like marker of depression , as both vulnerable groups showed activity similar to the depressed group , while amygdala hypoactivity during positive autobiographical recall is a state marker of depression manifesting in active disease .

25526599|The authors sought to address these gaps by evaluating developmental change in threat-related amygdala reactivity in adolescents at high or low risk for depression based on family history , before onset of disorder .

25526599|Change in amygdala reactivity was assessed as a function of family history of depression and severity of stressful life events .

25526599|These results suggest that heightened amygdala reactivity emerges during adolescence , prior to the development of depression , as a function of familial risk or , in the absence of familial risk , stressful life events .

25083567|The first half of this paper briefly reviews the evidence that -LRB- i -RRB- stress precipitates depression by damaging the hippocampus , leading to changes in the activity of a distributed neural system involving , inter alia , the amygdala , the ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , the lateral habenula and ascending monoamine pathways , and -LRB- ii -RRB- antidepressants work by repairing the damaged hippocampus , thus restoring the normal balance of activity within that circuitry .

24926249|The goal of this study was to use neuroimaging to test what the unique contribution is of depression and anxiety symptomatology on emotional processing and amygdala activation , and to compare the results with a healthy control group .

24926249|We were particularly interested in the relation between depression/anxiety symptomatology and patterns of amygdala activation .

24926249|However , we found that dimensional scores on an anxiety but not a depression subscale significantly predicted brain activation in the right amygdala when processing fearful , happy and neutral faces .

24926249|These results suggest that anxiety symptoms are a better predictor for differentiating activation patterns in the amygdala than depression symptoms .

24926249|To conclude , this study shows that abnormal amygdala responses to emotional faces in depression and anxiety seems to be more dependent on anxiety symptoms than on depression symptoms , and thereby highlights the need for more research to better characterize clinical groups in future studies .

24882567|These findings may be relevant to the normalization of amygdala hyperactivity and negative mood states in patients with major depression .

24745955|We hypothesized that healthy 14-year-olds with relatives with depression would demonstrate increased amygdala responses to negative stimuli , as compared with their peers with no family history of mental disorders .

24745955|Both a hypothesis-driven region-of-interest analysis and a whole-brain analysis of variance revealed that negative distractors elicited greater amygdala activation in adolescents with a family history of depression compared to controls .

24742621|Calcineurin downregulation in the amygdala is sufficient to induce anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors in C57BL/6J male mice . .

24742621|Pharmacological -LRB- CSA -RRB- and viral-mediated gene transfer -LRB- adeno-associated viral expression of short hairpin RNA -LSB- shRNA -RSB- -RRB- approaches were used to inhibit calcineurin activity systemically or selectively in the amygdala of the mouse brain to determine the role of calcineurin in behaviors related to anxiety and depression .

24742621|In the forced swim model of depression-like behavior , both systemic CsA treatment and shRNA-mediated calcineurin blockade in the amygdala significantly increased immobility .

24742621|Taken together , these data demonstrate that decreasing calcineurin activity in the amygdala increases anxiety-like behaviors and to some extent depression-like behaviors .

24737710|Emerging findings indicate ELT is associated with enhanced amygdala reactivity to aversive stimuli in never-depressed healthy controls as well as those with acute depression but may be absent in non-ELT exposed depressed .

24737710|These findings indicate opposing system-level differences within depression relative to ELT are expressed as differential amygdala reactivity .

24732411|Changes in histone acetylation and histone-modifying enzymes were examined in hippocampus , amygdala and frontal cortex which are considered critical for anxiety , depression and cognition .

24719001|These are : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the deactivation of the default mode network that generates spontaneous thoughts , contributes to the maintenance of the autobiographical self and is associated with anxiety and depression ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the anterior cingulate cortex that underpins attention functions ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- the anterior insula associated with the perception of visceral sensation , the detection of heartbeat and respiratory rate , and the affective response to pain ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- the posterior cingulate cortex which helps to understand the context from which a stimulus emerges ; -LRB- 5 -RRB- the temporoparietal junction which assumes a central role in empathy and compassion ; -LRB- 6 -RRB- the amygdala implicated in fear responses .

24707138|The involvement of structures the limbic system , such as the anterior cingulate cortex , the prefrontal cortex , and the amygdala , paves the way for the discovery of the mechanisms underlying depression depression , anxiety , alexithymia , personality traits , and other psychological impairments following the onset of IBD .

24694839|Phosphodiesterase 2 -LRB- PDE2 -RRB- is linked to cGMP-PKG signaling and highly expressed in the limbic brain regions including hippocampus and amygdala , which may play important roles in the treatment of depression and anxiety .

24688456|Brain diseases including depression , epilepsy , autism , schizophrenia , and Alzheimer 's disease , have been associated with amygdala dysfunction .

24665088|In CFS/ME patients , the BP -LRB- ND -RRB- values of -LRB- 11 -RRB- C - -LRB- R -RRB- - PK11195 in the amygdala , thalamus , and midbrain positively correlated with cognitive impairment score , the BP -LRB- ND -RRB- values in the cingulate cortex and thalamus positively correlated with pain score , and the BP -LRB- ND -RRB- value in the hippocampus positively correlated with depression score .

24577365|Volumetric change in the hippocampus , amygdala , and putamen from early to mid-adolescence was associated with the onset of depression during adolescence .

24577365|Sex moderated the association between amygdala growth and depression such that exaggerated growth and attenuated growth of the amygdala were associated with depression in females and males , respectively .

24552994|Recently , it has been proposed that abnormalities in neuronal structural plasticity may underlie the pathogenesis of major depression , resulting in changes in the volume of specific brain regions , including the hippocampus -LRB- HIP -RRB- , the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PC -RRB- , and the amygdala -LRB- AMY -RRB- , as well as the morphology of individual neurons in these brain regions .

24468014|Several studies have pointed to the amygdala as a main limbic station capable of regulating different stressful states such as anxiety and depression .

24455472|Youth MDD is characterized by abnormal activations in ventromedial frontal regions , the anterior cingulate and amygdala , which are broadly consistent with the implicated role of medial network regions in the pathophysiology of depression .

24406081|After 6 and 12 weeks , we quantified -LRB- 1 -RRB- clinical response -LRB- ? 50 % decrease in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale -LRB- HDRS -RRB- , -LRB- 2 -RRB- SERT occupancy in both amygdala measured by repeated -LSB- 123I -RSB- ?-CIT single photon emission computed tomography -LRB- SPECT -RRB- , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- amygdala activation when viewing fearful and angry -LRB- negative -RRB- faces with repeated functional MRI scans .

24359855|If some neurofunctional abnormalities seem to be independent of mood state , others were preferentially associated with mania or depression , involving the amygdala and other limbic regions as well as ventral frontal regions , with a likely hemispheric lateralization of these abnormalities according to the thymic state that was examined .

24318124|We focus on the hypothalamus , hippocampus , amygdala , nucleus accumbens , prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex , key brain regions that not only modulate emotions and cognition but also the response to stress itself , and discuss disorders like depression , post-traumatic stress disorder , Cushing syndrome and dementia .

24198772|Previous neuroimaging studies have consistently showed increased amygdala activity during the presentation of negative stimuli or regulation of negative emotion in the homozygous short allele carriers , suggesting the key role of amygdala response in mediating increased risk for depression .

24198772|These results suggest that 5-HTTLPR genetic variation modulates amygdala connectivity which subsequently affects its activity during mood regulation , providing an additional mechanism by which the S allele confers depression risk .

24176688|In addition , the right amygdala may play a role in depression symptomatology regardless of the side of the epileptogenic focus .

24090511|Electroconvulsive therapy increases hippocampal and amygdala volume in therapy refractory depression : a longitudinal pilot study . .

24090511|Therefore , the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of ECT on hippocampus and amygdala volume in 15 antidepressant-free patients with treatment refractory depression -LRB- seven males , range 42-63 years -RRB- .

24074474|Similarly , region-of-interest analyses revealed amygdalar and insular hypoperfusion in the group with depression , as well as hyperperfusion in the putamen and superior insula -LRB- p < .05 , corrected -RRB- .

25508091|Systematizes the data on the role of serotonin and sex steroids in the mechanisms involved in the stress response of Amygdala , and its participation in the formation of mood , emotions and the genesis of depression .

25438560|Systematizes the data on the role of serotonin and sex steroids in the mechanisms involved in the stress response of Amygdala , and its participation in the formation of mood , emotions and the genesis of depression .

24059962|Discriminative regions for symptoms of depression were the right pulvinar -LRB- happy -RRB- and left amygdala -LRB- sad -RRB- .

24040806|In recent years , the hypothalamus , amygdala and hippocampus have attracted increased interest with regard to the effects of stress on neurobiological systems in individuals with depression and suicidal behaviour .

24040385|Abnormal functional connectivity of amygdala in late-onset depression was associated with cognitive deficits . .

24038516|Distinct amygdala excitability during automatic stages of the processing of emotional faces may reflect differential pathophysiological processes in BD versus MDD depression , potentially representing diagnosis-specific neural markers mostly unaffected by current psychotropic medication .

24036129|Indeed , it is suggested that amygdala abnormalities are related to the co-morbid depression and anxiety reported in MTLE .

24006268|No significant genotype effects were observed on the volume or surface area of total brain , or several brain regions sometimes observed to be abnormal in human depression , including hippocampus , amygdala , or striatum .

23994212|These early and late connections in the amygdala appear to reveal a negative bias to coarse expression information processing and abnormal negative modulation in patients with depression , which may critically affect depression discrimination .

23968960|Prenatal maternal depression associates with microstructure of right amygdala in neonates at birth . .

23968960|Adjusting for household income , maternal age , and smoking exposure , postconceptual age at magnetic resonance imaging , and birth weight , we found significantly lower fractional anisotropy -LRB- p = .009 -RRB- and axial diffusivity -LRB- p = .028 -RRB- , but not volume -LRB- p = .993 -RRB- , in the right amygdala in the infants of mothers with high compared with those with low-normal Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores .

23968960|The results reveal a significant relation between antenatal maternal depression and the neonatal microstructure of the right amygdala , a brain region closely associated with stress reactivity and vulnerability for mood anxiety disorders .

23965605|Stress and depression are associated with aberrant neuroplasticity in the amygdala : there is increased dendritic arborization and synaptogenesis , perhaps explaining the increased anxiety and fear that are often apparent in depressed patients .

23957449|Altered neuropathic pain behaviour in a rat model of depression is associated with changes in inflammatory gene expression in the amygdala . .

23957449|This study shows that neuropathic pain-related responding to an innocuous cold stimulus is altered in an animal model of depression , effects accompanied by changes in the expression of neuroinflammatory genes in the amygdala .

23864672|However , synaptic depression within the context of amygdala-dependent behavior remains poorly understood .

23864672|Previous work identified lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- calcium-permeable AMPA receptors -LRB- CP-AMPARs -RRB- as a key target for synaptic removal in long-term depression -LRB- LTD -RRB- and persistent fear attenuation .

23850356|Taken together , the results of the present study highlight that neotrofin exhibits neuroprotective and antidepressant-like effects against CUMS induced depression , and suggest a possible mechanism for this protection via changes in synaptic plasticity within the amygdala .

23844175|However , the prefrontal cortex , amygdala , and temporal poles were found to be affected differently by major depression and schizophrenia .

23838294|In particular , depression and suicide are neurobiological kinds characterized by disturbances in serotonin functioning that affect various brain areas -LRB- i.e. , the amygdala , anterior cingulate , prefrontal cortex , and hippocampus -RRB- .

23825863|In animal models , stress and depression are associated with excitatory changes in the amygdala ; this aberrant neuroplasticity may represent increased fear learning , explaining the anxiety , fear , and related symptoms that characterize clinical depression .

23800487|Results suggest that , similar to findings in older depressed groups , depression at this age is associated with disrupted amygdala functioning during face processing .

23800487|The findings also raise the intriguing possibility that disrupted amygdala function is a depression-related biomarker that spans development .

23773793|We showed significantly lower ?2 * - nAChR availability -LRB- 20 % -38 % -RRB- in subjects with bipolar depression compared with euthymic and control subjects across all brain regions assessed -LRB- frontal , parietal , temporal , and anterior cingulate cortex , hippocampus , amygdala , thalamus , striatum -RRB- .

23769293|Abnormalities in amygdala function have been implicated in major depression .

23769293|Greater amygdala activity to target fearful faces was associated with depression , as was attenuated amygdala activity to target and peripheral happy faces .

23761775|Given that the vmPFC is known to regulate amygdala activity during emotional processing , we subsequently compared the perfusion in the vmPFC and the amygdala in depression-vulnerable -LRB- having early-life stress and high in rumination -RRB- and resilient -LRB- having early-life stress and high in mindfulness -RRB- subjects .

23761775|We found that depression-vulnerable subjects had increased amygdala perfusion and reduced vmPFC perfusion during the later runs than that during the earlier stressful task runs .

23761775|Our results indicate that the vmPFC of depression-vulnerable subjects may have a limited capacity to inhibit amygdala activation to repeated stress over time , whereas the vmPFC in resilient individuals may adapt to stress quickly .

23748930|Taken together , the prominent expression of GR protein in the human amygdala indicates that this region can form an important target for corticosteroids and stress , while the increased GR expression in major , but not bipolar , depression suggests possible involvement in the etiology of major depression .

23727405|Our results reinforce prior evidence that antidepressant action does not require forebrain GR , and suggest a correlation between the absence of depression-like phenotype and combined MR up-regulation and central amygdala GR deficiency .

23720503|Cortical spreading depression -LRB- CSD -RRB- , which underlies migraine aura -LRB- MWA -RRB- , induces C-fos expression in the amygdala .

23717632|Moreover , secondary analyses indicate that these amygdala and caudate volume associations persist after controlling for relevant demographic and individual difference factors -LRB- i.e. , age , total grey matter volume , neuroticism , depression -RRB- .

23714241|A previous study using a mouse model of depression showed that chronic immobilization stress -LRB- CIS -RRB- reduces levels of insulin-like growth factor -LRB- IGF -RRB- -2 , IGF binding protein 2 -LRB- IGFBP2 -RRB- , osteoglycin , and fibromodulin in the amygdala .

23669637|Dynamic connectivity laterality of the amygdala under negative stimulus in depression : a MEG study . .

23643106|Modulation of amygdala response and connectivity in depression by serotonin transporter polymorphism and diagnosis . .

23643106|Increased amygdala activity was associated with 5-HTTLPR genotype in low transcription allele carriers as well as with a diagnosis of depression .

23643106|The effects of genotype and diagnosis on amygdala connectivity showed a regional segregation , suggesting that 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms bias frontal-limbic connectivity while the development of depression involves more extensive neural disturbances .

23641204|Female vulnerability to the development of depression-like behavior in a rat model of intimate partner violence is related to anxious temperament , coping responses , and amygdala vasopressin receptor 1a expression . .

23639671|Oligodendrocyte density is changed in the basolateral amygdala in schizophrenia but not depression . .

23636982|Nonetheless , amygdala activity was correlated with the severity of subclinical depression symptoms and with emotional regulation skills .

23624153|As medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala are implicated in many of these disorders , understanding differential stress effects in these regions may shed light on the mechanisms underlying sex-dependent expression of disorders like depression and anxiety .

23622692|The heterogeneous nature of depression suggests an involvement of multiple distinct brain regions including amygdala , prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus , which may be responsible for the diversity of the symptoms .

23620758|Also , depression-specific effects of PCLO on dorsal striatal activation during negative word encoding and the absence of amygdalar salience signalling for novel positive information further suggest a role of PCLO in symptom maintenance in MDD .

23615118|Therefore , we hypothesize that tDCS is a neuromodulation technique that acts over depression through the modulation of serotonergic system and that tDCS '' top-down '' antidepressant effects might not be optimal in brain networks with a hyperactive amygdala inducing bottom-up effects , such as occurs in short-carriers .

23592753|In sex-specific analyses , men reporting poorer global sleep quality showed a significant association between amygdala reactivity and levels of depression and perceived stress -LRB- ? values = 0.29-0 .44 , p values < .05 -RRB- .

23588187|Carriers of a risk allele for depression , that is , the short -LRB- s -RRB- allele of the serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism -LRB- 5-HTTLPR -RRB- , exhibit amygdala hyperresponsiveness to negative environmental stimuli relative to homozygous long variant -LRB- l/l -RRB- .

23563720|Interestingly , mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and depression share a similar neurocircuitry involving : temporal lobes with hippocampus , amygdala and entorhinal and neocortical cortex ; the frontal lobes with cingulate gyrus ; subcortical structures , such as basal ganglia and thalamus ; and the connecting pathways .

23539535|The present study was performed to investigate whether endogenous opioid system is related to the depression , and the quantitative changes of endogenous opioids induced by electrical stimulation to the amygdala .

23538069|Chronic stress may contribute to affective disorders such as depression and anxiety via its effects on the amygdala .

23508528|Probabilistic tractography was performed between the midbrain/raphe and two target regions implicated in depression pathophysiology -LRB- amygdala and hippocampus -RRB- .

23487233|Sodium benzoate , a D-amino acid oxidase inhibitor , increased volumes of thalamus , amygdala , and brainstem in a drug-nave patient with major depression . .

23462582|When multiple regression analysis was conducted in all subjects , neither hippocampal nor amygdalar volume showed significant interaction effect between group and Geriatric Depression Scale -LRB- GDS -RRB- .

23433857|GMV reductions in bilateral fusiform gyrus and amygdala were observed in concordant affected twins for anxiety and depression compared to healthy twins .

23433857|As concordant affected MZ twins are believed to have a particularly high genetic liability for the disorder , our findings suggest that fusiform gyrus and amygdala gray matter reductions are related to a genetic risk for anxiety and depression .

23398442|This divergent pattern between the hippocampus and amygdala mirrors a neurobiological theme seen in depression resulting from reduced hippocampal , but increased amygdalar , size and function .

23385114|In several brain regions -LRB- ventral tegmental area -LRB- VTA -RRB- , cerebellum , and amygdala -RRB- , stimulation of mGluR1 selectively inhibits synaptic transmission mediated by calcium-permeable AMPA receptors -LRB- CP-AMPARs -RRB- and thus produces synaptic depression .

23319313|In healthy participants , L-carriers had reduced functional and anatomical connectivity between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- , which was correlated with anxiety or depression scores .

23319313|Our findings demonstrated that in Chinese Han participants , in contrast to Caucasians , the L-allele confers vulnerability to anxiety or depression and weakens top-down emotional control between the PFC and amygdala .

23261134|Furthermore , the ABD group , relative to HC , showed a prolonged response to fearful faces in right dorsolateral PFC. Clinical measures of mania and depression severity correlated with increased processing delays in the amygdala and striatum .

23260340|The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether the expression of proteins involved in neuroplasticity is altered in the amygdala of individuals with depression .

23260340|Basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- postmortem human brain samples were collected from individuals with a history of depression -LRB- n = 22 and 25 , respectively -RRB- and psychiatrically healthy controls -LRB- CTRL ; n = 14 -RRB- .

23260340|These results suggest that the BLA and CeA display contrasting patterns of neuroplasticity in depression , and that greater impairment of amygdalar neuroplasticity may be associated with increased risk of suicide .

23238724|Individual differences in amygdala-medial prefrontal anatomy link negative affect , impaired social functioning , and polygenic depression risk . .

23206875|We investigated the effect of two well characterized preclinical animal models of depression - repeated injections of corticosterone -LRB- CORT -RRB- and repeated restraint stress - on markers of GABAergic and glutamatergic activity in the hippocampus and amygdala .

23206667|Models describing the neural correlates of biased emotion processing in depression have focused on increased activation of anterior cingulate and amygdala and decreased activation of striatum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex .

23184639|These findings prompt further studies to better delineate intrinsic and externally evoked brain connectivity in anxiety and depression in relation to amygdala dysfunction .

23176970|Higher baseline activity in amygdala and ventral and mesial prefrontal cortex and lower activity in left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex were associated with higher depression scores .

23171695|Mood-congruent amygdala responses to subliminally presented facial expressions in major depression : associations with anhedonia . .

23154094|The neural responses in the left amygdala are significantly correlated with the severity of depression and comorbid anxiety .

23149149|We detected moderate effects for high postdexamethasone cortisol levels -LRB- odds ratio -LSB- OR -RSB- 3.28 ; 95 % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- 1.28-8 .39 ; P = .01 -RRB- , lower serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels -LRB- standardised mean difference -LSB- SMD -RSB- -0.52 ; 95 % CI -0.84 to -0.21 ; P = .001 -RRB- , smaller amygdala volumes -LRB- SMD -0.45 ; 95 % CI -0.89 to -0.02 ; P = .04 -RRB- , and a small effect for overall brain perfusion reduction -LRB- SMD -0.35 ; 95 % CI -0.64 to -0.06 ; P = .02 -RRB- , respectively , to poststroke depression .

23143517|For females , adolescent amygdala-vmPFC functional connectivity was inversely correlated with concurrent anxiety symptoms but positively associated with depressive symptoms , suggesting differing pathways from childhood cortisol levels function through adolescent amygdala-vmPFC functional connectivity to anxiety and depression .

23128924|Low levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor -LRB- BDNF -RRB- and reduced markers for GABA function , including in the amygdala , are reported in major depression , but their contribution to subgenual anterior cingulate cortex dysfunction is not known .

23125828|In the CBCT group , we found a trend increase in right amygdala response to negative images , which was significantly correlated with a decrease in depression score .

23124623|These low-expressing alleles are linked to increased risk for depression and brain activation patterns found in depression -LRB- increased amygdala activation and decreased amygdala-prefrontal cortex connectivity -RRB- .

23108923|The serotonin transporter gene has received the most attention in relation to depression , either alone or in conjunction with exposure to stressful life events -LRB- i.e. a gene x environment interaction -RRB- , whereas neuroimaging studies have suggested an association with amygdala activation .

23092981|We investigated the effects of stereotaxic infusion of activin into the hippocampus and the amygdala in a behavioural model of depression .

23071305|These data suggest that altered amygdala neuroplasticity may play a role the early dispositional risk to develop anxiety and depression .

23036622|Here we review the evidence from brain imaging and postmortem studies demonstrating that depression is accompanied by structural and functional alterations of cortical and limbic brain regions , including the prefrontal cortex , hippocampus and amygdala .

23034517|We hypothesized that healthy adolescents at increased genetic and environmental risk for developing mood disorders -LRB- depression and anxiety -RRB- would demonstrate increased amygdala reactivity to emotional stimuli compared to those with only one such risk factor or those with none .

23033120|The activation of amygdala and DLPFC correlated negatively with the severity of depression .

23033120|To conclude , semantic processing deficits in depression are modulated by emotional valence of the stimulus on the behavioral as well as on neural level in right-lateralized prefrontal areas and the amygdala .

23022470|Different studies have found that PSA-NCAM expression in the hippocampus and the amygdala is altered in schizophrenia , major depression and animal models of these disorders , in parallel to changes in the expression of molecules related to inhibitory neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity .

25558229|The overall depression severity -LRB- total scores of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale -RRB- was negatively correlated with the statistical probabilistic anatomical map results in the left amygdala and right inferior frontal gyrus .

22940575|Studies on these animal models point to some potential mechanisms that could explain epilepsy and depression comorbidity , such as various components of the dopaminergic , noradrenergic , serotonergic , and GABAergic systems , as well as key brain regions , like the amygdala and hippocampus .

22886588|Individuals with SLE often exhibit emotional dysregulation , such as lability and depression ; however , the behavioral impact of possible amygdala dysfunction has yet to be studied in this population .

22867951|Impact of family history and depression on amygdala volume . .

22867951|Higher familial risk in depression seems to be associated with smaller amygdala volumes , whereas depression alone is associated with larger amygdala volumes .

22855869|The amygdala , which develops neuropathology in the early stage of AD and is involved in the pathogenesis of depression , may be an important brain structure involved in the association between EPA and cognitive decline and depressive symptoms .

22854930|Increased amygdala responses to sad but not fearful faces in major depression : relation to mood state and pharmacological treatment . .

22854930|The purpose of this study was to determine whether abnormal amygdala responses to face emotions in depression are related to specific emotions or change in response to antidepressant treatment and whether they are present as a stable trait in medication-free patients in remission .

22854930|Patients with current depression had increased bilateral amygdala responses specific to sad faces relative to healthy comparison subjects and nonmedicated patients in stable remission .

22832909|Moreover , the PCLO risk allele appears to modulate amygdala function during fearful facial processing in MDD and may constitute a possible link between genotype and susceptibility for depression via altered processing of fearful stimuli .

22828748|Despite being implicated in the emotional symptoms of depression , the amygdala has received little attention compared to the hippocampus in the past studies of antidepressant action .

22828162|Regression analysis revealed that treatment response was predicted by pre-treatment SERT binding ratios , i.e. , SERT binding in key regions of depression including bilateral habenula , amygdala-hippocampus complex and subgenual cingulate cortex in relation to SERT binding in the median but not dorsal raphe nucleus -LRB- p < 0.05 FDR-corrected -RRB- .

22820234|The present study attempts to explore the mechanisms underlying the antidepressant-like action of curcumin by measuring the contents of brain derived neurotrophic factor -LRB- BDNF -RRB- in the amygdala of animal model of depression .

22814368|However , among women with PMDD follicular phase progesterone serum concentrations were positively correlated with bilateral amygdala reactivity while depression scores were positively correlated with right amygdala reactivity in the luteal phase .

22785087|Trait liability to depression and depressive symptoms are associated with reduced structural connectivity in tracts connecting the prefrontal cortex with the amygdala and anterior temporal cortex .

22773540|While the amygdala hypoactivation observed in bipolar II depression is opposite to the direction seen in bipolar I mania and may therefore be state dependent , the observed orbitofrontal cortex hypoactivation is consistent with findings in bipolar I depression , mania , and euthymia , suggesting a physiologic trait marker of the disorder .

22770650|However , in dimensional analyses , the severity of depression symptoms at the baseline preschool assessment predicted increased responses to sad faces in amygdala , hippocampal , parietal , and orbital frontal regions .

22751491|Strongest reductions were found in regions consistently reported to be altered in major depression and involved in emotion regulation , such as the subgenual part of the anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- -27.5 % -RRB- , the orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- -30.1 % -RRB- , the amygdala -LRB- -31.8 % -RRB- , the hippocampus -LRB- -30.6 % -RRB- and the insula -LRB- -28.9 % -RRB- .

22732813|The neurobiological model of depression in women presents vulnerabilities for some cerebral structures -LRB- hippocampus , frontal cortex , cerebral amygdala -RRB- .

24175168|An increased dendritic arborisation and synaptogenesis may instead be observed in the amygdala as a consequence of depression and stress-related disorders .

22698761|Major depressive disorder -LRB- MDD -RRB- is accompanied by morphological changes of brain structures which are of great importance in the neural circuitry mediating depression like the hippocampus and the amygdala .

22698761|We used magnetic resonance imaging to investigate alterations of amygdala and hippocampal volumes in 86 in-patients with unipolar depression and 87 healthy controls , and we then correlated amygdala and hippocampal volumes of 76 in-patients with the area under the curve of cortisol secretion in the dexamethasone/corticotropin releasing hormone -LRB- Dex/CRH -RRB- test at baseline and during short-term antidepressant therapy .

22696400|Major depression has been repeatedly associated with amygdala hyper-responsiveness to negative -LRB- but not positive -RRB- facial expressions at early , automatic stages of emotion processing using subliminally presented stimuli .

22696400|Because childhood maltreatment is a potent risk factor for the development of major depression in later life , we explored whether childhood maltreatment is associated with amygdalar emotion processing bias in maltreated but healthy subjects .

22696400|Childhood maltreatment is apparently associated with detectable changes in amygdala function during early stages of emotion processing which resemble findings described in major depression .

22688188|Anandamide levels in the basolateral amygdala were increased by extinction training and augmented by systemic AM3506 , whereas application of AM3506 to amygdala slices promoted long-term depression of inhibitory transmission , a form of synaptic plasticity linked to extinction .

22682158|However , neuroimaging studies have not so far revealed consistent evidence of abnormal responses to emotional stimuli in limbic structures , such as the amygdala , in remitted depression .

22672618|Here we investigated gene expression changes in the amygdala in the chronic immobilization stress -LRB- CIS -RRB- - induced depression model .

22659393|We also assessed effects of subclinical anxiety and depression on amygdala-prefrontal coupling during negative -LRB- versus neutral -RRB- word reading .

22659393|Both negative and positive words activated the amygdala , and negative-word processing revealed a positive correlation between amygdala activity and scores of trait anxiety and subclinical depression .

22652466|A volumetric analysis of the hippocampal head , body and tail , as well as the amygdala was performed to determine whether volume differences in these structures in PD relate to depression .

22450197|The greater left amygdala response to negative emotion for women accords with previous reports that women respond more strongly to negative emotional stimuli , as well as with hypothesized links between increased neurobiological reactivity to negative emotion and increased prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders in women .

22420593|The right amygdala was significantly more positively correlated with the left inferior frontal gyrus during mania and with the right insula during depression .

22420592|Our findings suggest major differences in recruitment of amygdala-PFC circuitry , supporting implicit emotion processing between remitted-BD and depressed-BD subjects , which may underlie changes from remission to depression in BD .

22407082|The amygdala is especially reactive to threatening stimuli , and the degree of reactivity predicts individual differences in the expression of depression and anxiety .

22403745|The rCBF in the right amygdala was significantly correlated with depression severity .

22401827|Imaging analyses demonstrated that adolescents with depression showed : -LRB- 1 -RRB- greater right amygdala activation during the maintain condition relative to controls , -LRB- 2 -RRB- less connectivity during the maintain condition between the amygdala and both the insula and medial prefrontal cortex than controls , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- a significant positive correlation between amygdala-seeded connectivities during maintenance of emotion and psychosocial functioning .

22401827|During the maintain condition , adolescents with depression showed a heightened amygdala response and less reciprocal activation in brain regions that may modulate the amygdala .

22289045|Both animal and human studies suggest that cognitive bias toward negative information , such as that observed in major depression , may arise through the interaction of cortisol -LRB- CORT -RRB- and norepinephrine -LRB- NE -RRB- within the amygdala .

22264442|Comparative gene array analysis in the amygdala and cingulate cortex between the serotonin transporter knockout mouse , a genetic animal model replicating features of human depression , and existing brain transcriptome data from postmortem tissue derived from clinically depressed humans was conducted to identify genes with similar changes across species -LRB- i.e. , conserved -RRB- that may help explain risk of depressive-like phenotypes .

22264442|Selected results were confirmed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction , including upregulation in the amygdala of transcripts for ADCY7 , a gene previously implicated in human depression and associated with altered emotional responsiveness in mouse models .

22174802|As extraversion is regarded a protective factor for developing anxiety disorders and depression and has been related to the generation of positive affect , the present results indicate that the reduced likelihood of developing affective disorders in individuals high on extraversion is related to modulation of emotion processing through the orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala .

22112927|Since both depression and PTSD have been associated with increased amygdala responsiveness to negative stimuli as well as reduced hippocampal gray matter volume , we speculated that childhood maltreatment results in similar functional and structural alterations in previously maltreated but healthy adults .

21888185|The aim of this study is to compare the volumes of hippocampus , amygdala and subgenual prefrontal cortex among patients with melancholic depression , patients with psychotic depression and normal controls .

21888185|In conclusion , melancholic and psychotic depression were not differentiated regarding the volumes of the hippocampus , the amygdala , and anterior and posterior subgenual cortex , even though amygdala volumes and left anterior subgenual cortex volume of both patient groups were differentiated compared to controls .

21878364|Neuroimaging studies examining depression have implicated the amygdala as an important potential locus of dysfunction in the processing of salient threatening stimuli .

21878364|The present findings raise the possibility that cognitive vulnerability to depression might be characterized by hypoactivation of the prefrontal cortex and hyperactivation of the amygdala in response to emotional stimuli ; our observations might provide a potential interpretation to explain the abnormalities in neural networks mediating cognitive modulation of emotions in individuals with cognitive vulnerability to depression .

21875617|Here , we compare the magnitude of long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- and long-term depression -LRB- LTD -RRB- in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- after euthanasia following either ether or isoflurane anesthesia , as well as in mice decapitated without anesthesia .

21873832|Limitations include missing antidepressant treatment data , recall bias , inability to establish a causal relationship between amygdala size and depression given the cross-sectional nature of the design .

21873832|Depression in later life is associated with smaller amygdala volumes , regardless of age of initial onset of depression .

21855859|Furthermore , amygdala -LSB- -LRB- 11 -RRB- C -RSB- AFM BP -LRB- ND -RRB- was inversely correlated with both Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety scores -LRB- r = -.55 , p = .035 -RRB- and Montgomery-sberg Depression Rating Scale scores -LRB- r = -.56 , p = .029 -RRB- .

21855859|Our findings of abnormally reduced amygdala 5-HTT binding in PTSD and its association with higher anxiety and depression symptoms in PTSD patients support a translational neurobiological model of PTSD directly implicating dysregulated 5-HTT signaling within neural systems underlying threat detection and fear learning .

21849983|Here , we show that stress-induced development of anxiety-like behavior is paralleled by a transient appearance of low-frequency stimulation-induced , 2-AG-mediated long-term depression at GABAergic synapses in the basolateral amygdala , a key region involved in motivation , affective regulation , and emotional learning .

21819983|Chronic stress in experimental animals , one of the most accepted models of chronic anxiety and depression , induces structural remodeling of principal neurons in the amygdala and increases its excitation by reducing inhibitory tone .

21788943|One prominent theoretical perspective highlights the top-down inhibition of amygdala by ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- as a crucial neural mechanism that may be defective in certain mood and anxiety disorders , such as major depression and post-traumatic stress disorder .

21764567|Recent attempts to understand the biological bases of depression vulnerability have revealed that both the short allele of the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region -LRB- 5-HTTLPR -RRB- and activity in the amygdala are associated with depression .

21764567|Other studies have reported amygdala hyperactivity associated with the 5-HTTLPR short allele , linking the genetic and neuroimaging lines of research and suggesting a mechanism whereby the short allele confers depression risk .

21764567|However , fewer investigations have examined the associations among depression , 5-HTTLPR variability , and amygdala activation in a single study .

21742442|I speculate that , in depersonalization disorder , the increased glutamate activity in prefrontal cortex is due to intrinsic imbalance , resulting in long-term potentiation , at the postsynaptic glutamate receptors on the GABAerg interneurons while the same receptor abnormality at the synapses on the intercalated GABAerg cells of the amygdala result in long-term depression in the case of either normal or high glutamate release .

21741179|Indeed , in mood disorders -LRB- unipolar depression , anxiety disorders , autism or schizophrenia -RRB- glial changes in brain regions involved in mood control -LRB- prefrontal and cingulate cortices , amygdala and the hippocampus -RRB- have been recurrently described .

21740626|Here , we studied whether memory bias is related to amygdala and hippocampal volume , two structures that are critical for emotional memory processes and that show consistent volume alterations in depression .

21740626|This suggests that an increased amygdala : hippocampus volume ratio plays a role in cognitive vulnerability often seen in individuals with high risk for depression and that these structural brain differences may pre-date the onset of depression .

21664935|Subtle amygdala development abnormalities may underlie particular vulnerabilities to sub-diagnostic depression and anxiety in teenage female marijuana users .

21657113|Here , we briefly summarize the most consistent structural magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- studies on amygdala in major depression and debate the effects of clinical variables on amygdalar morphology .

21654599|While there is decreased activity in amygdala with treatment for mania or depression among patients with PBD , there appears to be residual increased amygdala activity regardless of response , relative to healthy controls , suggesting a trait-like abnormality .

21632648|These data support the existence of a common abnormality in anxiety and depression in the ventral cingulate and the amygdala , which may be related to a shared genetic etiology .

21618660|Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to test the main effects of the Geriatric Depression Scale -LRB- GDS -RRB- and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test delayed recall -LRB- RAVLT-DR -RRB- scores , and their interaction on the intrinsic amygdala functional connectivity -LRB- AFC -RRB- network activity .

21616602|In addition , elevated CRF in cerebrospinal fluid is observed in mood and anxiety disorder patients , suggesting that CRF is also being overproduced from extrahypothalamic sources such as the central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- and overactivity of the amygdala in neuroimaging studies is a consistent finding in anxiety and depression patients .

21542937|Hence , baseline differences in amygdalar circadian regulation of cellular metabolism may contribute to sex-related differences in mood regulation and vulnerability to major depression .

21396459|The amygdala plays an important role in emotional and social functions , and amygdala dysfunction has been associated with multiple neuropsychiatric disorders , including autism , anxiety , and depression .

21354978|Correlation analyses using behavioural scales of the premutation groups showed significant associations between grey matter loss in the left amygdala and increased levels of obsessive-compulsiveness and depression , and between decreased grey matter in the left inferior frontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex and poor working memory performance .

21320489|In view of these observations , the aims of this review are -LRB- 1 -RRB- to describe the neuroplasticity deficits observed in diabetic rodents and patients ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- to summarize the similarities in the clinical and preclinical studies of depression and diabetes ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- to highlight the diabetes-induced neuroplasticity deficits in those brain regions that have been implicated as important pathological centers in depressive illness , namely , the hippocampus , the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex .

21312047|The aim of the present study was to utilize this model to gain insight into underlying mechanisms by quantifying amygdala/hypothalamus protein expression using gel-based proteomics and correlating changes in protein expression with changes in depression-like behavior .

21283580|Relative to control subjects , patients with depression showed increased hemodynamic responses in limbic-paralimbic and subcortical regions -LRB- e.g. amygdala and basal ganglia -RRB- but no signal decrease in prefrontal regions .

21282604|In the basolateral amygdala complex , it has been demonstrated that CB -LRB- 1 -RRB- is particularly enriched in axon terminals of cholecystokinin -LRB- CCK -RRB- - positive GABAergic interneurons , induces short - and long-term depression at inhibitory synapses , and is involved in extinction of fear memory .

21276593|Heightened amygdala reactivity to aversive stimuli in major depression is regarded as a core feature of the underlying physiology but individual differences in amygdala response may also arise secondary to persistent changes in limbic function during early neurodevelopment relative to stressors such as childhood trauma .

21276593|We sought to determine whether heightened amygdala response is a core feature of depression or a general risk factor for psychopathology secondary to early life stress .

21276593|Group differences in amygdala response suggest heightened reactivity was not characteristic of persons with depression in general but was true primarily in those with a significant history of abuse .

21276593|These findings suggest the relationship between childhood trauma and risk for depression is mediated by heightened amygdala response but varies by abuse type .

21257158|Depressed patients responded to positive social feedback with increased amygdala activation , demonstrating that amygdala hyperresponsivity in depression is not restricted to negatively-valenced stimuli .

21254899|The effect of GRPR deletion on depression-like behavior and its molecular signature in the amygdala , however , has not yet been evaluated .

21254899|We propose that deletion of GRPR leads to the induction of depression-like behavior which is paralleled by dysregulation of amygdala gene expression , potentially resulting from deficient light-induced corticosterone release in GRPR-KO .

21130225|Prenatal interaction produced anxiety , depression-like responses , and altered social behavior that were accompanied by decreased reactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis , attenuated serotonin neurotransmission in the hippocampus , reduced enlargement of lateral ventricles , decreased volumes of amygdala and periaqueductal gray matter and density of spines on dendrites of granule cells of the hippocampus .

21098407|Patients with PD with the highest scores for depression symptoms showed significantly raised  C-DASB binding in amygdala , hypothalamus , caudal raphe nuclei , and posterior cingulate cortex compared to low score cases , while  C-DASB binding values in other regions were similarly decreased in depressed and nondepressed patients with PD compared to healthy controls .

21037982|Following neonatal odor-shock pairings , but not unpaired controls , adults without the odor present showed increased depression-like behavior in the Forced Swim Test and Sucrose Preference Test and a deficit in paired-pulse inhibition in amygdala and piriform -LRB- olfactory -RRB- cortex .

20952073|Relative to the controls , the participants with increased familial risk of depression -LRB- FH -RRB- had diminished responses in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- to the presentation of fearful faces while the activity in the amygdala did not distinguish the groups .

20941370|Abnormal functional connectivity was found within three resting-state networks in depression : -LRB- 1 -RRB- decreased bilateral amygdala and left anterior insula connectivity in an affective network , -LRB- 2 -RRB- reduced connectivity of the left frontal pole in a network associated with attention and working memory , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- decreased bilateral lingual gyrus connectivity within ventromedial visual regions .

20869122|Previous research has indicated that symptom severity and amygdala reactivity during the viewing of facial expressions of emotion are related in depression .

20869122|A region of interest approach was used in order to examine the relationship between amygdala activation and depression severity .

20869122|Findings indicated that depressed preschoolers exhibited a significant positive relationship between depression severity and right amygdala activity when viewing facial expressions of negative affect .

20869122|The results suggest that , similar to older children and adults with depression , amygdala responsivity and degree of depression severity are related as early as age 3 .

20851110|These data demonstrate that brain region-specific changes in GR expression in response to DMI are strain dependent and that elevated amygdalar Nor-1 expression can contribute to depressive behavior in the WKY model of depression .

20843875|Abnormally reduced dorsomedial prefrontal cortical activity and effective connectivity with amygdala in response to negative emotional faces in postpartum depression . .

20843875|The authors examined activity in response to negative emotional faces in the dorsomedial pre-frontal cortex and amygdala , key emotion regulatory neural regions of importance to both mothering and depression .

20843875|In depressed mothers , there was also a significant negative correlation between left amygdala activity and postpartum depression severity and a significant positive correlation between right amygdala activity and absence of infant-related hostility .

20843875|Reduced amygdala activity in response to negative emotional faces is associated with greater postpartum depression severity and more impaired maternal attachment processes in postpartum depressed mothers .

20817488|We used semi-automated software for magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- to measure the volumes of the hippocampus , amygdala , ACC and subgenual prefrontal cortex -LRB- SGPFC -RRB- in 15 female patients with familial recurrent major depression -LRB- MD -RRB- and 15 healthy female subjects .

20816900|CRS caused a significant increase in depression-like behaviour that was associated with increased NPY mRNA levels in the medial amygdala .

20800687|Episodic memory impairment is considered to be a core cognitive deficit of Major Depressive Disorder -LRB- MDD -RRB- and has motivated a line of research investigating the role of the amygdala and the hippocampus in depression .

20686132|However , depression and anxiety disorders involve multiple areas of the brain , such as the amygdala and prefrontal cortex , where neurogenesis does not appear to occur in the adult mammalian brain .

20684832|In the amygdala there are significant NAA deficits in schizophrenia and depression and significant deficits of NAAG in the amygdala in the depression group .

20659172|Increased susceptibility for developing exaggerated fear responses was accompanied by decreased long-term depression and increased surface trafficking of the AMPA receptor GluR1 subunit at the level of the basolateral amygdala complex .

20655508|Learning in three tasks , for which memory consolidation has been shown to depend on local synaptic refinement in areas of interest -LRB- hippocampus-dependent declarative word-pair learning , amygdala-dependent fear conditioning , and primary-cortex-dependent visual texture discrimination -RRB- , was assessed in 23 inpatients who met International Classification of Disease , 10th Revision , criteria for severe unipolar depression and 35 nondepressed comparison subjects .

20655508|The results of the study are consistent with the neuroplasticity hypothesis of depression , showing decreased synaptic plasticity in a dorsal executive network that comprises the hippocampus and elevated synaptic plasticity in a ventral emotional network that includes the amygdala in depression .

20445054|To identify the precise anatomical site -LRB- s -RRB- of Y2-mediated anxiogenic action , we investigated the effect of site-specific deletion of the Y2 gene in amygdaloid nuclei on anxiety and depression-related behaviors in mice .

20378100|This enhanced excitability of amygdala neurons after chronic stress may explain the observed hyperresponsiveness of the amygdala in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder and may facilitate the emergence of depression or anxiety in other patients .

20376317|Robust shifts in amygdala-cingulate gene synchrony were observed in subjects with major depressive disorder -LRB- MDD , denoted here '' depression '' -RRB- -LRB- n = 14 ; MDD/Permutated data , p < 0.000001 -RRB- , significantly affecting between 100 and 250 individual genes -LRB- 10-30 % false discovery rate -RRB- .

20233962|In contrast , depression was associated with more activity in the anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- dorsal ACC and rostral ACC -RRB- and the bilateral amygdala .

20233962|Results imply that depression , particularly when accompanied by anxious arousal , may result in a failure to implement top-down processing by appropriate brain regions -LRB- left DLPFC , right IFG -RRB- due to increased activation in regions associated with responding to emotionally salient information -LRB- right DLPFC , amygdala -RRB- .

20215925|Adolescents with major depression demonstrate increased amygdala activation . .

20215925|Thus , the main purpose of this study was to further our knowledge of the underlying neural substrates of adolescent depression by examining the bilateral amygdala specifically and the whole brain in depressed adolescents compared to healthy controls .

20215925|These results suggest that -LRB- 1 -RRB- depressed adolescents without a comorbid psychiatric disorder exhibit an abnormally hyperactive amygdala compared to healthy controls ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- models of adult depression might be extended to include depressed adolescents ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- neuropsychiatric interventions that have been developed in depressed adults should be further examined in adolescents .

20062812|Our findings underscore the amygdala as a potential target to modulate antidepressants ' action in hippocampal neurogenesis and in their link to depression-like behaviors .

19858108|These results demonstrate the effect of the S allele on amygdala activity during intentional mood regulation and suggest that amygdala hyperactivity during recovery from a sad mood may be one mechanism by which the S allele confers depression risk .

19775504|Here we report that fear conditioning resulted in an increase in AMPA/NMDA ratio as well as depression of paired-pulse facilitation -LRB- PPF -RRB- in neurons of the lateral nucleus of amygdala .

19748075|Automatic mood-congruent amygdala responses to masked facial expressions in major depression . .

19748075|Furthermore , amygdala responsiveness to happy facial expression was negatively correlated with current depression severity .

19748075|Thus , depression is characterized by mood-congruent processing of emotional stimuli in the amygdala already at an automatic level of processing .

19415422|We propose that trigeminovascular projections from the medullary dorsal horn to selective areas in the midbrain , hypothalamus , amygdala and basal forebrain are functionally positioned to produce migraine symptoms such as irritability , loss of appetite , fatigue , depression and the quest for solitude .

19716552|Blockade of protein phosphatase 2B activity in the amygdala increases anxiety - and depression-like behaviors in mice . .

19716552|Pharmacological CsA and viral-mediated gene transfer -LRB- adeno-associated viral expression of short hairpin RNA -LSB- AAV-shRNA -RSB- -RRB- approaches were used to inhibit calcineurin activity globally and selectively in the amygdala of the mouse brain to determine the role of calcineurin in behaviors related to depression and anxiety .

19716552|In the forced swim and tail suspension models of depression-like behavior , calcineurin blockade in the amygdala increased immobility similarly to manipulations that lead to a depression-like phenotype .

19716552|Taken together , these data demonstrate that decreasing calcineurin activity in the amygdala increases anxiety - and depression-like behaviors .

19706319|Chronic stress increased oxidative metabolism in several depression-related brain regions in male but not female LC-rats such as amygdala , hippocampus and anterior thalamus .

19703521|Glucocorticoid hormones have been shown to contribute to many cognitive functions , such as depressions , learning and memory , and abnormal glucocorticoid secretion results in functional changes in prefrontal cortex and amygdala .

19605536|A molecular signature of depression in the amygdala . .

19605536|Large-scale gene expression was monitored in postmortem tissue from the anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala in paired male subjects with familial major depression and matched control subjects without major depression -LRB- N = 14-16 pairs -RRB- .

19605536|Significant and bidirectional predictions of altered gene expression were identified in amygdala between major depression and the UCMS model of depression .

19605536|These studies demonstrate that the biological liability to major depression is reflected in a persistent molecular pathology that affects the amygdala , and support the hypothesis of maladaptive changes in this brain region as a putative primary pathology in major depression .

19545982|To assess amygdala processing in individuals with unipolar depression , we applied a functional MRI -LRB- fMRI -RRB- paradigm previously shown to be sensitive to amygdala function .

19545982|While both depressed and healthy groups showed increased amygdala activity when viewing emotive faces compared to geometric shapes , patients with unipolar depression showed relatively more activity than healthy subjects , particularly on the left .

19490038|Behavioral depression induced by an amygdala seizure and the opioid fentanyl was mediated through the nucleus accumbens . .

19490038|The hypothesis that an opioid fentanyl and an amygdala-evoked seizure induced behavioral depression through the nucleus accumbens was tested .

19490038|The behavioral depression induced by an amygdala-kindled seizure was studied in fully kindled rats , with or without prior injection of fentanyl -LRB- 0.05 mg/kg , s.c. -RRB- .

19482603|We describe anatomical structures that are activated and/or altered in response to both depression and pain -- examples include the insular cortex , the prefrontal cortex , the anterior cingulate cortex , the amygdala , and the hippocampus .

19482265|Positive correlation between the density of neuropeptide y positive neurons in the amygdala and parameters of self-reported anxiety and depression in mesiotemporal lobe epilepsy patients . .

19482265|Cell counts were related to self-reported depression , anxiety , quality of life , clinical parameters -LRB- onset and duration of epilepsy , seizure frequency -RRB- , antiepileptic medication , and amygdala and hippocampal magnetic resonance imaging volumetric measures .

19482265|Densities of NPY-positive basolateral amygdala neurons showed significant positive correlations with depression and anxiety scores , and they were negatively correlated with lamotrigine dosage .

19452633|Criticism may be a risk factor for relapse because it activates the amygdala and perturbs the affective circuitry that underlies depression .

19450794|Abnormal amygdala-prefrontal effective connectivity to happy faces differentiates bipolar from major depression . .

19450794|Abnormal , left-sided , top-down OMPFC-amygdala and right-sided , bottom-up , amygdala-OMPFC EC during happy labeling distinguish BD and MDD , suggesting different pathophysiological mechanisms associated with the two types of depression .

19441665|In bipolar depression , a reduced metabolism in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and increased metabolism in amygdala and thalamus were reported .

19403806|Acid-sensing ion channel-1a in the amygdala , a novel therapeutic target in depression-related behavior . .

19403806|Restoring ASIC1a to the amygdala of ASIC1a -LRB- - / - -RRB- mice with a viral vector reversed the forced swim test effects , suggesting that the amygdala is a key site of ASIC1a action in depression-related behavior .

19403806|These data are consistent with clinical studies emphasizing the importance of the amygdala in mood regulation , and suggest that ASIC1a antagonists may effectively combat depression .

19394960|Reduced amygdala volume in newly admitted psychiatric in-patients with unipolar major depression . .

19394960|Structural neuroimaging studies investigating amygdala volumes in patients suffering from major depression have yielded variable results .

19394960|This study of a sample of unmedicated depressed in-patients adds to the small , yet growing , body of evidence linking untreated major depression to reduced amygdala volume .

19335934|The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism impacts parahippocampal and amygdala volume in healthy humans : incremental support for a genetic risk factor for depression . .

19284230|Reduced amygdalar-thalamic and amygdalar-SACC connections could be a contraindication to DBS for depression .

19211996|Here , we examined the regulation of BDNF expression in the hippocampus and amygdala of rats subjected to the chronic mild stress -LRB- CMS -RRB- model of depression , a paradigm that induces anhedonia , a core symptom of depression .

19193712|The current study tested the hypothesis that the projections from the infralimbic -LRB- IL -RRB- area of the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- to the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , a pathway relevant to stress-related mental illnesses like depression and post-traumatic stress disorder , would have a unique pattern of remodeling in response to chronic stress .

19176279|Criticism may be a risk factor for relapse because it activates the amygdala and perturbs the affective circuitry that underlies depression .

19153574|Here we examined the explicit interactions between the brain-derived neurotrophic factor -LRB- BDNF -RRB- Val66Met gene and early life stress -LRB- ELS -RRB- exposure in brain -LRB- amygdala-hippocampal-prefrontal gray matter volume -RRB- , body -LRB- heart rate -RRB- , temperament and cognition in 374 healthy European volunteers assessed for depression and anxiety symptoms .

19087175|Intracerebroventricular -LRB- i.c.v. -RRB- infusion of IL-1ra 4 h after i.p. LPS injection attenuated the reduction in social interaction , a cardinal sign of behavioural depression during sickness , and c-Fos expression in the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis .

19085964|In this study , we examined the morphometric basis for these functional changes in late-life depression -LRB- LLD -RRB- by analyzing both the size and shape of the amygdalae with the hypothesis that shape differences may be apparent even when overall volume differences are inconsistent .

19028381|The amygdala and hippocampus play a key role in the neural circuitry mediating depression .

19028381|It remains unclear how much structural and functional changes of amygdala and hippocampus reflect the acute state of depression or an underlying neurobiological trait marker of depression .

19028381|Neurotoxic effects might account for the fact that state-related amygdala enlargement has not been found in recurrent depression with relative long illness duration .

19008895|We found that healthy controls have a strong association between the 5-HTTLPR and GM volumes of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , left anterior gyrus cinguli , left amygdala as well as right hippocampus , whereas there is no such association in patients with major depression .

18838040|The amygdala , striatum , and structures within the prefrontal cortex are highly involved in mediating these stages of emotion processing , and evidence indicates that these regions show structural and functional alterations in different types of psychopathology , including anxiety , depression , and autism spectrum disorders .

18837865|To investigate neural activity in prefrontal cortex and amygdala during bipolar depression .

18787661|Effect of hippocampal and amygdala volumes on clinical outcomes in major depression : a 3-year prospective magnetic resonance imaging study . .

18787661|In a prospective , longitudinal study , we examined the hippocampus and amygdala of 30 inpatients with major depression from the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy and 30 healthy participants from the community -LRB- control group -RRB- using high-resolution magnetic resonance images at baseline and after 3 years .

18717711|In right TLE patients , left and right amygdala activation was significantly related to preoperative anxiety and depression levels , and preoperative right amygdala activation correlated significantly with postoperative change of anxiety and depression scores , characterized by greater increases in anxiety and depression in patients with greater preoperative activation .

18628348|A hypersensitive amygdala is associated with both a genetic polymorphism and a pattern of negative cognitive biases and dysfunctional beliefs , all of which constitute risk factors for depression .

18628348|Further , the combination of a hyperactive amygdala and hypoactive prefrontal regions is associated with diminished cognitive appraisal and the occurrence of depression .

18614671|A polymorphism in the human serotonin transporter -LRB- 5-HTT -RRB- gene is implicated in susceptibility to anxiety and depression and in enhanced emotion-induced activation in the amygdala .

18603301|Decreased functional coupling of the amygdala and supragenual cingulate is related to increased depression in unmedicated individuals with current major depressive disorder . .

18586109|Disrupted top-down control by the prefrontal cortex of the amygdala may underlie this abnormal response to negative feedback in unipolar depression .

18570704|Elevated levels of NR2A and PSD-95 in the lateral amygdala in depression . .

18570704|The present study investigated glutamate signalling proteins in the amygdala from depressed subjects , given strong evidence for amygdala pathology in depression .

18570704|Increased levels of NR2A and PSD-95 suggest that glutamate signalling at the NMDA receptor in the amygdala is disrupted in depression .

18568105|The neural model of a dysfunction of limbic prefrontal cortical structures that impairs the modulation of the amygdala in major depression may explain the present results .

18559283|After eight weeks of SSRI antidepressant treatment , patients with depression showed significantly increased DLPFC activity to unattended fear-related stimuli and no longer differed from controls in either DLPFC or amygdala activity .

18550030|These data provide further support for elevated amygdala activity in depression and suggest that anterior cingulate activity may be a predictor of treatment response to both pharmacotherapy and CBT .

18544183|Reduced amygdala-prefrontal coupling in major depression : association with MAOA genotype and illness severity . .

18504424|In this meta-analysis we examine results from magnetic resonance imaging volumetry studies of the amygdala in depression in order to assess both the nature of the relationship between depression and amygdala volume as well as the influence of extraexperimental factors that may account for significant variability in reported findings .

18504424|The lack of a reliable difference in amygdala volume between depressed and never-depressed individuals was accounted for by a positive correlation between amygdala volume differences and the proportion of medicated depressed persons in study samples : whereas the aggregate effect size calculated from studies that included only medicated individuals indicated that amygdala volume was significantly increased in depressed relative to healthy persons , studies with only unmedicated depressed individuals showed a reliable decrease in amygdala volume in depression .

18504424|These findings are consistent with a formulation in which an antidepressant-mediated increase in levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor promotes neurogenesis and protects against glucocorticoid toxicity in the amygdala in medicated but not in unmedicated depression .

18450931|Hippocampal and amygdalar volumes in psychotic and nonpsychotic unipolar depression . .

18450931|Neuroanatomical studies of subjects with depression have often examined hippocampal and amygdalar structures , since they are two key structures of the limbic system .

18450931|The purpose of the present study was to examine differences in hippocampal and amygdalar volumes in patients with depression subtypes relative to healthy comparison subjects .

18450931|Correlational analyses suggested that age of depression onset was strongly associated with amygdala volume .

18450931|However , psychotic but not nonpsychotic depression was associated with reduced amygdala volume .

18450931|Reduced amygdala volume was not associated with severity of depression or severity of psychosis but was associated with age at onset of depression .

18450931|Smaller amygdala volume may be a risk factor for later development of psychotic depression .

18450931|In addition , chronicity of depression and depression subtype might be two important factors associated with hippocampal and amygdalar volumes in depression .

18412626|Cortical spreading depression modulates synaptic transmission of the rat lateral amygdala . .

18402630|Therefore , we hypothesized that adolescents with bipolar depression successfully treated with lamotrigine would show decreases in amygdalar activation , and increases in prefrontal activation .

18402630|Activation in bilateral amygdalae and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- for negative minus neutral pictures was correlated with Children 's Depression Rating Scale -LRB- CDRS -RRB- scores .

18396414|To test this hypothesis , we assessed amygdala responses to an emotional faces paradigm during functional magnetic resonance imaging in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for the risk of anxiety and depression -LRB- n = 10 pairs -RRB- and in monozygotic twin pairs concordant for high -LRB- n = 7 pairs -RRB- or low -LRB- n = 15 pairs -RRB- risk for anxiety and depression .

18396414|Our findings indicate amygdala hyperactivity in subjects who are at high risk for anxiety and depression through environmental factors and amygdala hypoactivity in those at risk mainly through genetic factors .

18391157|Multiple linear regression analyses did not reveal a significant association with hippocampal or amygdalar volume for any of the depression parameters .

18391157|Cox regression analyses showed that subjects with early onset depression had an increased risk for AD -LRB- HR 3.76 ; 95 % CI 1.41 to 10.06 -RRB- , independent of hippocampal and amygdalar volume , whereas this risk was 2.34 -LRB- 95 % CI 0.82 to 6.69 -RRB- in subjects with a late-onset depression .

18387137|While no difference of allelic distribution between patients and controls was detected , the described effect of 5-HTR -LRB- 1A -RRB- genotype on amygdala volume was found for the whole group of patients , as well as in the subgroup of patients with comorbid major depression -LRB- P = 0.004 -RRB- but not in controls .

18371940|Dopamine receptor gene expression in human amygdaloid nuclei : elevated D4 receptor mRNA in major depression . .

18371940|Previous findings from this laboratory demonstrating changes in dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- transporter and D2 receptors in the amygdaloid complex of subjects with major depression indicate that disruption of dopamine neurotransmission to the amygdala may contribute to behavioral symptoms associated with depression .

18371940|In addition , relative levels of mRNA of DA receptors in the basal amygdaloid nucleus were measured postmortem in subjects with major depression and normal control subjects .

18371940|Elevated DA receptor gene expression in depressive subjects further implicates altered dopaminergic transmission in the amygdala in depression .

18329735|The development of the prefrontal cortex , hippocampus , amygdala and ventral striatum is described from a translational perspective as they relate to stress exposure , onset , pathogenesis and gender differences in depression .

18289936|Patients with clinical depression showed areas of significantly lower current density than non-depressed patients in delta band at left anterior temporal , left midtemporal -LRB- including amygdala and hippocampus -RRB- , and both frontopolar cortices mostly on the right ; and in theta band at bilateral parietal lobe , anterior cingulate and medial frontal cortex .

18257652|Poor functioning of amygdala has also been associated with anxiety , autism , depression , narcolepsy , post-traumatic stress disorder , phobias , frontotemporal dementia , and schizophrenia .

18072812|Impairment of neuroplasticity in the hippocampus , amygdala and cortex is hypothesized to be the mechanism by which cognitive function , learning , memory and emotions are altered in depression .

18043766|In the present study , we extended the paradigm to a sample of 35 inpatients suffering from depression to investigate the effect of amygdala reactivity on automatic negative judgmental bias and clinical characteristics in depression .

17986682|This study compares amygdala and nucleus accumbens activation in children and adolescents at high and low risk for major depression under varying attentional and emotional conditions .

17947358|Dysregulation of neuronal crh expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus correlates with some forms of depression , and amygdalar crh expression may modulate levels of anxiety .

17825840|This pattern of altered function is consistent with animal models of stress responses and depression , where hypertrophic changes in the amygdala and atrophic changes in the ACC are observed .

17825840|While the histological basis for GMC changes in adult clinical populations is poorly-known at present , the observed pattern is consistent with the direction of change , in animal models of anxiety and depression , of neuronal number and/or morphological complexity in both the amygdala -LRB- where it is increased -RRB- and ACC -LRB- where it is decreased -RRB- .

17719567|Compared with control subjects , patients with depression showed an enhanced amygdala response to unattended fear-related stimuli -LRB- relative to unattended neutral -RRB- .

17714920|Monoamines and dehydroepiandrosterone -LRB- DHEA -RRB- levels were measured in a genetic animal model for childhood depression in four subcortical structures : nucleus accumbens -LRB- Nac -RRB- , ventral tegmental area -LRB- VTA -RRB- , amygdala and hypothalamus .

17699669|These findings indicate that a key feature underlying the pathophysiology of major depression is the counterproductive engagement of right prefrontal cortex and the lack of engagement of left lateral-ventromedial prefrontal circuitry important for the downregulation of amygdala responses to negative stimuli .

17688985|However , within the MDD group , the severity of depression correlated with the activity of the left amygdala , bilateral inferior orbitofrontal areas , and the left insula to negative pictures , whereas there were no clear indications of association between specific cerebral regions and positive pictures .

17598644|These experiments suggest that rapid neurotransmitters changes observed in the nucleus accumbens and amygdala , are possibly related to immobility and emotional states such as anxiety , aversion and/or depression caused by pain .

17585888|Activation during successful inhibitory events in bilateral inferior frontal and left amygdala , insula , and nucleus accumbens and during unsuccessful inhibition -LRB- commission errors -RRB- in rostral anterior cingulate predicted post-treatment improvement in depression symptoms .

17562698|In this critical review , we examine the feasibility of identifying biomarker of bipolar disorder by discussing existing findings regarding functional abnormalities in neural systems underlying emotion processing -LRB- amygdala centered -RRB- , working memory , and attention -LRB- dorsolateral prefrontal cortex centered -RRB- that persist through bipolar depression and remission and are bipolar specific rather than common to unipolar depression .

17550594|The amygdala plays an important role in affective states and disorders such as anxiety and depression .

17545449|The right amygdala volume was negatively correlated with visual new learning and not related to depression , anxiety , irritability , agitation or apathy at baseline or 12-month follow-up .

17545449|However , baseline amygdala volume was negatively correlated with Hamilton depression scores at 12 months in healthy comparison subjects .

17545449|It is not related to psychopathology except that small amygdalae may increase vulnerability to depression .

17511971|This study examined amygdala volume and its potential association with early onset major depression .

17511618|Reductions in the density and ultrastructure of oligodendrocytes are also detected in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala in depression .

17406646|5-HTTLPR biases amygdala activity in response to masked facial expressions in major depression . .

17406646|Increased amygdala reactivity has been discussed in the context of major depression .

17406646|In the present study , amygdala reactivity to displays of emotional faces was measured by means of fMRI at 3T in 35 patients with major depression and 32 healthy controls .

17404118|To examine the effect of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on hippocampal and amygdala volumes in patients with major depression and in healthy control subjects .

17353912|The goal of this study was to identify new molecular targets associated with suicide and with major depression using oligonucleotide microarrays in the limbic system -LRB- amygdala , hippocampus , anterior cingulate gryus -LRB- BA24 -RRB- and posterior cingulate gyrus -LRB- BA29 -RRB- -RRB- .

17350756|We correlated Beck Depression Inventory -LRB- BDI -RRB- scores from 16 adolescents with prefrontal , anterior cingulate , and amygdala activity during functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- FMRI -RRB- of the Stroop Interference task .

17345879|Age-related processes , including arteriosclerosis , inflammatory and degenerative diseases , may compromise the integrity of prefrontostriatal pathways and amygdala leading to increased vulnerability to depression .

17291590|The observed relation between reduced olfactory sensitivity and depressive symptoms could be mediated by functional deviations within brain structures subserving primary olfactory processing such as amygdala and piriform cortex which is in line with results showing abnormal activity pattern in the amygdala and other brain regions in depression .

17289261|Angiotensin II suppresses long-term depression in the lateral amygdala of mice via L-type calcium channels . .

17284168|Serotonergic genes modulate amygdala activity in major depression . .

17284168|This study used an imaging genomics approach to investigate amygdala activity in major depression as a function of common functional polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter gene -LRB- 5-HTTLPR -RRB- and the serotonin receptor 1A gene -LRB- 5-HT -LRB- 1A -RRB- -1019 C/G -RRB- .

17284168|In 27 medicated patients with major depression , amygdala responses to happy , sad and angry faces were assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 Tesla .

17259350|The integrity of the amygdala may influence mood disturbances in TLE patients with HS , as depression was associated with a relative preservation of the contralateral amygdala .

17234600|We used a 5-HTT knock-out -LRB- KO -RRB- mouse to examine the effects of genetically driven loss of 5-HTT function for the following : -LRB- 1 -RRB- depression-related behavior in response to repeated stress , and pavlovian fear conditioning , extinction , and extinction recall ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- dendritic morphology and spine density of Golgi-stained pyramidal neurons in the infralimbic cortex -LRB- IL -RRB- and the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

17215168|We examined the relationship between self-reported depression severity and both structural MRI volumetry and -LSB- -LRB- 18 -RRB- F -RSB- fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography -LRB- PET -RRB- - measured resting metabolism of the amygdala and hippocampus of 18 patients with TLE .

17215168|Significant positive relationships were noted between right and left amygdala volumes and depression .

17215168|These findings indicate that both right and left amygdala volumes are associated with depression severity among persons with TLE .

17156697|However , the existing literature on human psychiatry and behavior supports our reported evidence for a neurobiologic relationship between symptoms of anxiety and depression with amygdala structure and function .

17062369|Furthermore , the control of motivational behaviour and dopamine release is apparently modified by hippocampal and amygdala activity , both brain regions showing pathological changes in schizophrenia and depression .

17055560|It may also be relevant to other regions of the CNS where estrogen is known to exert profound effects , such as amygdala and hypothalamus ; and may provide greater insight into neurological disorders and psychiatric illness , including Alzheimer 's disease , depression and epilepsy .

17032778|Based on functional MRI and perfusion data , we found support for a model by which life stress interacts with the effect of serotonin transporter genotype on amygdala and hippocampal resting activation , two regions involved in depression and stress .

17027931|Increased amygdala and decreased dorsolateral prefrontal BOLD responses in unipolar depression : related and independent features . .

17027931|This study explored relationships between amygdala and DLPFC activity during emotional and cognitive information processing in unipolar depression .

17027931|Decreased relationships between the time-series of amygdala and DLPFC activity were observed within tasks in depression , but different depressed individuals showed each type of bias .

17027930|These results confirm previous reports that bipolar depression is associated with abnormally increased metabolism in the amygdala , ventral striatum , orbitofrontal cortex , anterior cingulate , and anterior insula , and extend these results to bipolar disorder type II depressives on lithium or divalproex .

17010993|Anticipation of aversive stimuli activates extended amygdala in unipolar depression . .

17010993|Hamilton depression scores of the patients correlated positively with activation of the left and right ventral amygdala during expectation of negative stimuli .

17010993|We interpret enhanced activation in the amygdala/SLEA as a possible consequence of altered future thinking in patients suffering from depression .

16981862|This depression is almost always seen in hippocampus but less in amygdala .

16950223|This study examined whether amygdala modulates memory for negatively valenced words before and after a sad mood induction in healthy individuals with and without a history of recurrent major depression .

16950223|These results are consistent with cognitive diathesis-stress theories and suggest a role for the amygdala in modulating mood-congruent memory during transient sad mood in individuals who are vulnerable to depression relapse .

16930719|Serotonin transporter gene status predicts caudate nucleus but not amygdala or hippocampal volumes in older persons with major depression . .

16930719|Although hippocampal and amygdala volumes were smaller in those with depression as compared with control subjects , 5-HTT gene status did not predict this reduction in size .

16924019|Lewy bodies in the amygdala increase risk for major depression in subjects with Alzheimer disease . .

16924019|Major depression was present in 11 -LRB- 9 % -RRB- AD alone cases , and in 25 -LRB- 18 % -RRB- of the AD + LBs cases ; amygdala : 8 -LRB- 31 % -RRB- , scores 1 to 2 : 1 -LRB- 5 % -RRB- , scores 3 to 6 : 3 -LRB- 11.5 % -RRB- , and scores 7 to 10 : 13 -LRB- 14 % -RRB- .

16924019|Major depression was associated with LBs , in general -LRB- relative risk -LSB- RR -RSB- = 3.06 , 95 % CI : 1.25 to 7.46 -RRB- , with amygdala only LBs -LRB- RR = 8.56 -LRB- 95 % CI : 1.83 to 40.3 -RRB- , and with LB scores 7 to 10 -LRB- RR = 3.83 , 95 % CI : 1.33 to 11.0 -RRB- .

16924019|There was an association between all amygdala LBs cases -LRB- amygdala only LBs + LB scores 7 to 10 -RRB- and major depression -LRB- RR = 4.77 , 95 % CI : 1.78 to 12.7 -RRB- , but no association was noted between LBs and depression in the absence of amygdala LBs -LRB- RR = 0.96 , 95 % CI : 0.46 to 1.06 -RRB- .

16924019|Lewy bodies -LRB- LBs -RRB- in the amygdala and in cortical areas increase the risk for major depression in Alzheimer disease .

16924019|That is , all of the cases with cortical LBs also had LBs in the amygdala , making this region the critical area for the development of depression .

16837173|It was speculated that ECT affected both the prefrontal cortex , commonly assumed to be involved in depression , and the amygdala , known to play a central role in the processing of emotional stimuli , through the limbic-cortical-striatal-pallidal-thalamic circuit .

16828176|Moreover , it could provide a hint that amygdala MAPK activation might be involved in the formation of depression-like behavior .

16815618|The amygdala has a role in the modulation of moods and emotion , processes that are known to be affected in people with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and depression .

12724175|Taken together with converging evidence from neuroendocrine , lesion analysis , and postmortem studies of clinically depressed subjects , these data suggest that emotional/stress-response systems that include the amygdala are pathologically activated in major depression and that this activity is associated with dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex and monoamine neurotransmitter systems that normally modulate such responses .

12586453|No significant correlations were found between amygdala volumes and age of onset , illness duration , or severity of depression .

12372665|The binding of -LSB- -LRB- 125 -RRB- I -RSB- RTI 55 to DA transporter was significantly lower in the basal and central amygdaloid nuclei , whereas the binding of -LSB- -LRB- 125 -RRB- I -RSB- epidepride to D2/D3 receptors was significantly higher in the basal , central , and lateral amygdaloid nuclei in major depression compared with control subjects .

10624542|We found a significant positive correlation between left amygdala volumes -LRB- p = .02 -RRB- and a trend towards positive correlation between right amygdala volumes and depression -LRB- p = .06 -RRB- , as measured with the Beck Depression Inventory .

10624542|This is the second report of a relationship between amygdala volumes and depressed mood , confirming an earlier finding in patients with bipolar disease , and the first study reporting a correlation between amygdala volumes and depression .

10618023|Patients with depression had a statistically significant 19 % smaller left hippocampal volume than comparison subjects , without smaller volumes of comparison regions -LRB- amygdala , caudate , frontal lobe , and temporal lobe -RRB- or whole brain volume .

10594049|Long-term depression of excitatory synaptic transmission in the rat amygdala . .

10594049|Here , we show for the first time that low-frequency stimulation of the lateral nucleus at 1 Hz for 15 min elicited a long-term depression -LRB- LTD -RRB- in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- neurons .

10580500|The depression in prefrontal spontaneous activity is related to amygdala activity but not to the freezing response itself .

10415674|Functional neuroimaging studies of the anatomical correlates of familial major depressive disorder -LRB- MDD -RRB- and bipolar disorder -LRB- BD -RRB- have identified abnormalities of resting blood flow -LRB- BF -RRB- and glucose metabolism in depression in the amygdala and the orbital and medial prefrontal cortical -LRB- PFC -RRB- areas that are extensively connected with the amygdala .

10415674|The amygdala metabolism in MDD and BD is positively correlated with both depression severity and '' stressed '' plasma cortisol concentrations measured during scanning .

10415674|The orbital C metabolism is also abnormally elevated during depression , but is negatively correlated with both depression severity and amygdala metabolism , suggesting that this structure may be activated as a compensatory mechanism to modulate amygdala activity or amygdala-driven emotional responses .

10405084|The hippocampus , amygdala and related functional circuits have been implicated in the regulation of emotional expression and memory processes , which are affected in major depression .

10381776|Lateralized binding in amygdala , high locomotor activity , and sensory sensitivity correlated positively with greater sensitivity to SNC-80-induced depression in these measures .

10336080|Cortical spreading depression reversibly disrupts convulsive motor seizure expression in amygdala-kindled rats . .

10336080|To determine the role of the frontal cortex in the generalization of limbic seizures , we first produced unilateral cortical spreading depression to reversibly suppress neuronal activity in the motor cortex and then triggered an amygdala-kindled seizure .

10336080|Three minutes following induction of unilateral spreading depression , stimulation of the ipsilateral kindled amygdala produced only a brief electrographic seizure , and completely failed to produce the bilateral electrographic and clonic convulsive seizures that were normally present during control trials .

10336080|A very different outcome occurred when unilateral spreading depression was induced in the cortex contralateral to the kindled amygdala .

10322186|Particular emphasis has been placed on the prefrontal cortex , anterior cingulate , parietal cortex , and the amygdala as critical components of the circuitry that may be dysfunctional in both depression and anxiety .

10189618|Preclinical studies on long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- and long-term depression -LRB- LTD -RRB- in hippocampal and amygdala slices , as well as clinical data from neuroimaging studies , have provided encouraging clues for potential frequency-dependent effects of rTMS .

9893154|In addition , recent data reveal important bidirectional interactions between stress-system hormonal factors in depression and neural substrates implicated in many discrete behavioral alterations in depression -LRB- e.g. , the medial prefrontal cortex , important in shifting affect based on internal and external cues , the mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system , and the amygdala fear system -RRB- .

9886229|The role of the amygdala in modulating emotional memory is highlighted , as well as some of its unique properties such as metaplasticity -LRB- i.e. , the differential direction of long-term adaptation , either potentiation or depression -RRB- in response to the same input as a function of the prior history of stimulation .

9831467|The role of the amygdala in major depression was investigated .

9674587|Patients with depression have impaired functioning in emotional tasks involving the amygdala , and have abnormal resting amygdala blood flow .

9674587|To better understand the anatomical basis for these functional changes we measured the volumes of the total amygdala and of the core amygdala nuclei in 20 patients with a history of depression and 20 pair-wise matched controls .

9464991|This represents the first demonstration of stimulus-dependent long-lasting synaptic depression in the amygdala .

9464991|Thus , LFS in the in vitro amygdala slice can induce either enduring synaptic potentiation or depression , depending on whether a priming HFS train has been applied .

9105961|5-HT1A receptor binding sites were measured , by saturation binding with -LSB- 3H -RSB- 8-OH-DPAT , in frontal and occipital cortex , hippocampus and amygdala obtained at post-mortem examination from suicide victims with a firm retrospective diagnosis of depression , and matched controls .

8994053|Using whole-cell voltage-clamp and current-clamp recordings , this study shows for the first time that in control and kindled basolateral amygdala neurons , two pharmacologically distinct presynaptic mGluRs mediate depression of synaptic transmission .

8985703|Finally , since our anatomical studies indicated that the perirhinal cortex densely innervates the frontal motor cortex , we examined the involvement of this latter region in amygdala kindled seizures using the reversible functional lesion of cortical spreading depression .

8595196|Using low frequency -LRB- quenching -RRB- stimulation parameters -LRB- 1 Hz for 15 min -RRB- , similar to those that induce long-term depression -LRB- LTD -RRB- in vitro , we attempted to alter amygdala kindling in vivo in rats .

8777899|Another finding was the occurrence of REM sleep ponto-geniculo-occipital -LRB- PGO -RRB- waves , coinciding with a depression of the frequency and amplitude of interictal amygdaloid and cortical spikes .

8545073|We recorded entorhinal tetanic responses to 50-Hz kindling stimulations applied at the amygdala in conscious rats , which produced facilitation and depression during the train pulses , in order to analyze the relationship of the changes in the tetanic responses to the development of both after-discharges -LRB- ADs -RRB- and behavioral seizures .

7858845|Paired-pulse depression of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated synaptic potentials in the amygdala . .

7858845|An in vitro slice preparation of rat amygdala was used to study the paired-pulse depression of the N-methyl-D-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- receptor-mediated synaptic potential e.p.s.p.NMDA .

8270597|Primary depression also is associated with abnormal activation of key brain areas , including discrete aspects of the frontal and temporal lobes , the amygdala , and the cingulate gyrus .

1294197|In the present study we evaluated the potential role of these neurotransmitters in the postictal behavioral depression -LRB- PBD -RRB- , after-discharge -LRB- AD -RRB- duration , and seizure intensity in rats kindled in the medial preoptic area -LRB- MPOA -RRB- and amygdala -LRB- AMG -RRB- .

1335269|Reversible blockade of the neocortex by spreading depression and of the parabrachial nucleus -LRB- PBN -RRB- and amygdala -LRB- AMG -RRB- by tetrodotoxin -LRB- TTX -RRB- injection was used to study lateralization of passive avoidance reaction -LRB- PAR -RRB- engrams in rats .

1450903|Long-term effects of kindling consisted of facilitation of ACh release in the ventral striatum contralateral to the kindled amygdala and bilateral depression of DA release in the prefrontal cortex .

1527602|These data along with other evidence suggest that a circuit involving the prefrontal cortex , amygdala , and related parts of the striatum , pallidum , and medial thalamus is involved in the functional neuroanatomy of depression .

1587331|These results demonstrated that GABA infusion at the concentration of 100 micrograms.microliters-1 induced a strong ipsilateral depression in glucose utilization in the NBM and in some surrounding structures -LRB- e.g. , the lateral hypothalamic area , thalamus , and amygdala -RRB- as well as in the major cortical targets of NBM neurons -LRB- i.e. , the frontal , parietal , and temporal cortices -RRB- .

1480730|One of these circuits , the limbic-thalamo-cortical circuit , which includes the amygdala , the medio-dorsal thalamus , and parts of the ventral and medial prefrontal cortex , may be engaged in abnormal reverberatory activity that maintains the cognitive and emotional set of depression .

1928425|High-energy diet intake was associated with saccharin-induced depression of 2-deoxyglucose uptake in the inferior olive and increased utilization in the medial amygdaloid nucleus of both DR and DIO rats .

1782545|Thalamic and most cortical areas showed reductions of the order of 30-45 % , whereas more modest depressions of 15-20 % were observed in some limbic structures -LRB- e.g. basolateral amygdala , anterior thalamic nuclei , nucleus accumbens , subiculum -RRB- .

3443185|During motor activity , there is a systematic correlation among increasing premotor , motor and amygdaloid multispike activities , increasing HR and depressed HR-rhythms with limbic initiation of motor and concomitant autonomic patterns , '' Immobile confrontations '' alone produces vagally induced HR-decrease and increased amplitudes of vagal HR-rhythms with a concomitant cortical multispike depression , a mirror image of the autonomic patterns after nociceptive stimulation .

2888153|With IP treatment Conflict rates were increased , but after amygdaloid infusion both TO and Conflict rates were marginally reduced below control level , with a more consistent depression of punished responding .

3785666|In the mammillary body , the rate of glucose utilization was more sensitive to depression than elsewhere in the brain -LRB- 55 % reductions following 0.3 mg/kg diazepam -RRB- , whilst in the lateral amygdala , the rate of glucose use was less sensitive -LRB- 8 % reductions following 0.3 mg/kg diazepam -RRB- .

3123974|The electroencephalogram showed a sequence of alterations characterised by high voltage fast activity , spiking , bursts of polyspiking , electrographic seizures and postictal depression which first appeared in the amygdala and rapidly spread to hippocampal and cortical areas .

4065271|Prolonged postictal depression in amygdala-kindled rats by the adenosine analog , L-phenylisopropyladenosine . .

4065271|The present study demonstrated that systemic administration of the adenosine analog , L-phenylisopropyladenosine -LRB- L-PIA -RRB- , substantially prolonged the postictal depression and decreased the frequency of spiking that follows amygdala-kindled seizures in rats .

6479105|The results obtained may be summarized as follows : -LRB- 1 -RRB- kindled generalized convulsions resulted in three consecutive postictal stages before recovery from postictal behavioral depression ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- in bilaterally kindled cats , PSI lasted for 3-4 h , which was longer than the postictal behavioral depression ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- no correlation was found between interictal spike frequency and decreased susceptibility to convulsion during PSI ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- the duration of PSI was prolonged significantly after secondary site amygdaloid kindling ; and -LRB- 5 -RRB- such changes were observed greater than 2 weeks after the last secondary site stimulation .
