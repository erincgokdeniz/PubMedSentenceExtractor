27107209|Low dose intranasal oxytocin delivered with Breath Powered device dampens amygdala response to emotional stimuli : A peripheral effect-controlled within-subjects randomized dose-response fMRI trial . .

27107209|These data suggest the dampening of amygdala activity in response to emotional stimuli occurs via direct intranasal delivery pathways rather than across the blood-brain barrier via systemically circulating OT .

27101139|Prior studies said that gray matter volume in the posterior insula was correlated with empathy , and the functional connectivity between this area and the amygdala was associated with emotional regulation .

27092094|Are Plasma Oxytocin and Vasopressin Levels Reflective of Amygdala Activation during the Processing of Negative Emotions ?

27092094|The amygdala is considered to be an important brain region for regulating emotion-based behavior , with OT and AVP modulating activity in the amygdala during the processing of negative emotions .

27092094|In particular , increased OT levels may diminish amygdala activation -LRB- anxiolytic effects -RRB- and enhanced AVP levels may augment amygdala activation -LRB- anxiogenic effects -RRB- when negative emotions are processed .

27092067|Previous studies have shown that emotional stimuli can be processed through the amygdala without conscious awareness .

27092067|Our results showed significant interaction among category , emotion and context in the amygdala and subcortical regions .

27092060|Our findings demonstrate the existence of topographic NI and relaxin-3-containing projections to specific nuclei of the extended amygdala , consistent with a likely role for this putative integrative arousal system in the regulation of amygdala-dependent social and emotional behaviors .

27092057|The 5-HT input to the amygdala has drawn particular interest because genetic and pharmacological alterations of the 5-HT transporter -LRB- 5-HTT -RRB- affect amygdala activation in response to emotional stimuli .

27087745|Manipulation of neurotransmission within the amygdala affects the expression of conditioned and unconditioned emotional memories such as fear freezing behaviour .

27083779|Altered amygdala-prefrontal connectivity during emotion perception in schizophrenia . .

27083779|The current study utilized psychophysiological interaction analyses to examine functional connectivity between the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- during an emotion perception task .

27083779|Overall , results suggest that emotional dysfunction and associated deficits in functional outcome in schizophrenia may relate to abnormal interactions between the amygdala and mPFC during perception of emotional stimuli .

27077317|The amygdala is a key region for acquisition and expression of fear , and storage of fear and emotional memories .

27075857|In addition , mice in the L : DLD condition showed increased anxiety-like behaviors and reducedbrain-derived neurotropic factormessenger RNA expression in the hippocampus , amygdala , and medial prefrontal cortex , which are brain regions that are involved in emotional regulation .

27069053|These findings provide the first evidence for the neural consequences of basolateral amygdala damage during the processing of complex emotional situations .

27065800|The central , lateral and basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- nuclei are essential for the formation of long-term memories including emotional and drug-related memories .

27053114|The role of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase A in regulating emotional behavior and amygdala function . .

27053114|In the present study , we found that IP3K-A expression is highly enriched in the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , which plays a pivotal role in the processing and expression of emotional phenotypes in mammals .

27039701|Functional decoding analyses revealed an association of the amygdalae and these regions with emotion , reward and memory processing , as well as action execution .

27039344|Taken together , our findings highlight the role of right amygdala , hippocampus and insula in the abnormal emotional and sensory processing in OSA .

27033686|Mindful attention to breath regulates emotions via increased amygdala-prefrontal cortex connectivity . .

27033686|A key finding across different emotion regulation strategies is the modulation of amygdala and prefrontal activity .

27033686|It is unclear how ATB relevant brain areas in the prefrontal cortex integrate with amygdala activation during emotional stimulation .

27033686|We proposed that , during emotional stimulation , ATB down-regulates activation in the amygdala and increases its integration with prefrontal regions .

27033686|Results suggest amygdala-dorsal prefrontal cortex integration as a potential neural pathway of emotion regulation by mindfulness practice .

27030378|The amygdala is a complex group of nuclei implicated in the integration and generation of emotional behavioural responses , including those associated with pain , and a region known as the central amygdala is particularly associated with generation of behavioural responses , due to its links to the descending pain modulation pathways ; as such , study of amygdalar c-Fos immunoreactivity can help identify the neuronal circuits involved .

27028781|The amygdala plays a central role in higher-order emotional processing and the posterodorsal subnucleus of the medial amygdala -LRB- MePD -RRB- , in particular , is involved in food intake .

27026110|Stressful experiences increase the release of prefrontal amygdala neurotransmitters , a response that is relevant to cognitive , emotional , and behavioral coping .

27015710|However , object categorization in the presence of trigeminal pain was associated with stronger activity in task-relevant visual areas -LRB- lateral occipital complex , LOC -RRB- , memory encoding areas -LRB- hippocampus and parahippocampus -RRB- and areas implicated in emotional processing -LRB- amygdala -RRB- compared to peripheral pain .

27013684|To further elucidate the amygdala-independent mechanisms leading to aversive emotional experiences , we retested two of these patients -LRB- B.G. and A.M. -RRB- to examine whether triggering palpitations and dyspnea via stimulation of non-chemosensory interoceptive channels would be sufficient to elicit panic anxiety .

27013102|Trait self-control correlated positively with successful emotion regulation both subjectively and neurally , as indicated by online ratings of negative emotions and functional connectivity strength between the amygdala and prefrontal areas , respectively .

27013102|This stronger overall connectivity of the left amygdala was related to more successful subjective emotion regulation.Comparing amygdala activity over time showed that high self-controllers successfully maintained downregulation of the left amygdala over time , while low self-controllers failed to down-regulate towards the end of the experiment .

27008987|Our results thus define a key axonal molecule that participates in the wiring of amygdala circuits and helps bring about fear emotion during the important adolescence period .

27004933|Sex-specific neural circuits of emotion regulation in the centromedial amygdala . .

27004933|Sex-related differences in emotion regulation -LRB- ER -RRB- in the frequency power distribution within the human amygdala , a brain region involved in emotion processing , have been reported .

27002909|The amygdala is an important brain area involved in cognitive procession and emotional regulation .

27000940|In addition to prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- and hippocampus , amygdala may have a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia , given its pivotal role in emotion and extensive connectivity with the PFC and hippocampus .

27000301|Moreover , D , in respect to H , displayed a greater reactivity of the right amygdala , which may be an expression of emotional dysregulation .

26998659|The affective ToM deficit was associated with atrophy in the amygdala , suggesting the involvement of emotion-processing deficits in this impairment .

26998482|Altered Resting-State Amygdala Functional Connectivity after Real-Time fMRI Emotion Self-Regulation Training . .

26998482|The amygdala is composed of structurally and functionally distinct nuclei , such as the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and centromedial amygdala -LRB- CMA -RRB- , both of which are involved in emotion processing , generation , and regulation .

26991156|Our analyses revealed that -LRB- a -RRB- amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex were significantly involved in prioritizing positive or negative cues , but not in subjective evaluations of conflict per se , and -LRB- b -RRB- superior temporal sulcus -LRB- STS -RRB- and inferior parietal lobule -LRB- IPL -RRB- , which have been implicated in social cognition and emotion control , were involved in both prioritizing positive or negative cues and subjectively evaluating conflict , and may thus constitute '' hubs '' or '' switches '' in emotional conflict processing .

26969864|Opposing effects of negative emotion on amygdalar and hippocampal memory for items and associations . .

26969864|Findings support a dual representation account , whereby negative emotion up-regulates the amygdala to strengthen item memory but down-regulates the hippocampus to weaken associative representations .

26964869|The suggested neurobiological bases of ADHD focus on the amygdala as a center of emotions processing .

26964869|Therefore , we hypothesize that patients with ADHD will show an irregular pattern of emotional-related activity of the amygdala region as well as some structural abnormalities .

26964869|These results might suggest that lower emotional processing and less control of impulsivity is associated with dysfunctional amygdala in ADHD patients .

26958462|In this pilot study , MDD patients in the experimental group -LRB- n = 13 -RRB- learned to upregulate BOLD activity of the left amygdala using an rtfMRI-nf during a happy emotion induction task .

26958462|Temporal correlations between frontal EEG asymmetry and BOLD activity were significantly enhanced , during the rtfMRI-nf task , for the amygdala and many regions associated with emotion regulation .

26958462|Our findings demonstrate an important link between amygdala BOLD activity and frontal EEG asymmetry during emotion regulation .

26952506|We then summarize the existing evidence for the relationship between child poverty and brain structure and function , focusing on brain areas that support memory , emotion regulation , and higher-order cognitive functioning -LRB- ie , hippocampus , amygdala , prefrontal cortex -RRB- and regions that support language and literacy -LRB- ie , cortical areas of the left hemisphere -RRB- .

26951096|Strong activations were observed in the various areas associated with sexual arousal comprised of various factors : -LRB- 1 -RRB- activation areas related to cognitive factors : the occipital lobe and parietal lobe ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- activation areas related to emotional factors : the thalamus and amygdala ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- activation areas related to motivational factors : the anterior cingulate gyrus , orbitofrontal cortex , and insula ; and -LRB- 4 -RRB- activation areas related to physiological factors : the precentral gyrus , putamen , and globus pallidus .

26941102|The purpose of this study was to investigate patterns in the amygdala-based emotional processing circuit of hemodialysis patients using resting-state functional MR imaging -LRB- rs-fMRI -RRB- .

26941102|This indicates that ACC plays a role in amygdala-based emotional regulatory circuits in these patients .

26937004|Projections from the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- to the cortex convey information about the emotional value and the expectation of a sensory stimulus .

26931629|Age-related changes in amygdala-frontal connectivity during emotional face processing from childhood into young adulthood . .

26931629|There has been growing interest in understanding the neural circuitry underlying development of emotional processing , with previous research implicating functional connectivity between amygdala and frontal regions .

26931629|In the current study , we examined age-related changes in brain activity and amygdala functional connectivity during an fMRI emotional face matching task -LRB- including angry , fearful , and happy faces -RRB- in 61 healthy subjects aged 7-25 years .

26931629|We found age-related decreases in ventral medial prefrontal cortex activity in response to happy faces but not to angry or fearful faces , and an age-related change -LRB- shifting from positive to negative correlation -RRB- in amygdala-anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- ACC/mPFC -RRB- functional connectivity to all emotional faces .

26931629|Age-related changes in amygdala-ACC/mPFC connectivity did not vary for processing of different facial emotions , suggesting changes in amygdala-ACC/mPFC connectivity may underlie development of broad emotional processing , rather than threat-specific processing .

26926791|The involvement of the human amygdala in emotion-related processing has been studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- for many years .

26926791|However , despite the amygdala being comprised of several subnuclei , most studies investigated the role of the entire amygdala in processing of emotions .

26926791|Here we combined a novel anatomical tracing protocol with event-related high-resolution fMRI acquisition to study the responsiveness of the amygdala subnuclei to negative emotional stimuli and to examine intra-amygdala functional connectivity .

26926791|The greatest sensitivity to the negative emotional stimuli was observed in the centromedial amygdala , where the hemodynamic response amplitude elicited by the negative emotional stimuli was greater and peaked later than for neutral stimuli .

26926605|The amygdala plays a key role in initiating responses to biologically relevant information , such as facial expressions of emotion .

26924679|This points to differences in the adolescent neural circuitry that underlies mood and emotion , such as the amygdala .

26915535|Increased amygdala reactivity might lead to negative bias during emotional processing that can be reversed by antidepressant drug treatment .

26915535|However , little is known on how N-methyl-d-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- receptor antagonism with ketamine as a novel antidepressant drug target might modulate amygdala reactivity to emotional stimulation .

26913957|Pain is an emotion and neuropathic pain symptoms are modulated by supraspinal structures such as the amygdala .

26909323|We have recently shown that reduced amygdala activity during threat processing might underlie psilocybin 's effect on emotional processing .

26908926|We examined group differences in functional connectivity between amygdala , involved in emotional evaluation , and sub-regions of medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- MPFC -RRB- , involved in emotion regulation and cognitive control .

26908926|In patients , reduced amygdala-MPFC connectivity during emotional distractors was related to worse emotional vs neutral accuracy , greater deficit syndrome severity , and unemployment .

26908926|Thus , reduced amygdala-MPFC functional connectivity during emotional distractors reflects a deficit that is specific to SCZ .

26908633|These data suggest that emotional processing in the amygdala rapidly modulates some neocortical processing , such as perception , recognition , and motor mimicry , when observing dynamic facial expressions of emotion .

26896742|Changes in functional connectivity with emotion regulation and treatment were linearly related to 5-HTTLPR ` L' allele load such that negative R IFG-L amygdala connectivity was increased with an increasing number of ` L' alleles .

26892942|The authors hypothesized that during face emotion labeling , irritability would be associated with dysfunctional activation in the amygdala and other temporal and prefrontal regions in both disorders , but that the nature of these associations would differ between DMDD and bipolar disorder .

26892942|Irritability correlated with amygdala activity across all intensities for all emotions in the DMDD group ; such correlation was present in the bipolar disorder group only for fearful faces .

26892860|Second , striatum and amygdala activations increased by the competition with familiar friends were significantly correlated with the increased ratings of pleasantness , which reflected emotionally positive feelings in victory for the competition with familiar opponents .

26892859|Region of interest analysis for basic emotion processing areas revealed enhanced amygdala activation in both emotional conditions , whereas anterior and posterior insula showed stronger activity during negative evaluations only .

26888383|This study presents structural imaging data indicating that musically creative people -LRB- as indicated by self-report -RRB- have greater cortical surface area or volume in a -RRB- regions associated with domain-specific higher-cognitive motor activity and sound processing -LRB- dorsal premotor cortex , supplementary and pre-supplementary motor areas , and planum temporale -RRB- , b -RRB- domain-general creative-ideation regions associated with the default mode network -LRB- dorsomedial prefrontal cortex , middle temporal gyrus , and temporal pole -RRB- , and c -RRB- emotion-related regions -LRB- orbitofrontal cortex , temporal pole , and amygdala -RRB- .

26884543|Results show that prosody effects in mid superior temporal cortex were gated by background complexity but not attention , while prosody effects in the amygdala and anterior superior temporal cortex were gated by attention but not background complexity , suggesting distinct emotional prosody processing limitations in different regions .

26880595|Although the amygdala has an important role in emotion processing and receives dopaminergic innervation , little is known about how dopamine transmission in this region contributes to emotion regulation .

26880595|This investigation aimed to evaluate emotion regulation in subjects who met DSM-IV criteria for methamphetamine dependence , and to test for a relationship between self-reports of difficulty in emotion regulation and D2-type dopamine receptor availability in the amygdala .

26880595|They also suggest that D2-type dopamine receptors in the amygdala contribute to emotion regulation in both healthy and methamphetamine-using subjects .

26878057|Healthy individuals can control their social emotional behavior through anterior prefrontal cortex -LRB- aPFC -RRB- downregulation of neural activity in the amygdala , with testosterone modulating aPFC-amygdala coupling .

26876924|The amygdalar nuclear complex and hippocampal/parahippocampal region are key components of the limbic system that play a critical role in emotional learning and memory .

26875722|Youth with DBD-LCU showed decreased functional connectivity between amygdala and regions including inferior frontal gyrus in response to emotional stimuli .

26869038|Neurotensin and its high affinity NTS1 receptor are densely localized in areas that process emotion -LRB- amygdala nucleus -RRB- , cognition -LRB- such as hippocampal nuclei and cortical areas -RRB- and the response to stress -LRB- hypothalamic nucleus -RRB- .

26866361|We show that both experimental sleep deprivation and insomnia are related to increased emotional reactivity and increased amygdala activation upon emotional stimuli presentation , and that particularly Rapid Eye Movement -LRB- REM -RRB- sleep is important for emotional processing and reorganization of emotion-specific brain activity .

26866361|Normal sleep onset deactivation of brain regions important for emotional processing -LRB- amygdala , anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- -RRB- is further affected in insomnia .

26858213|Furthermore , the G-allele was associated with increased amygdala responsiveness to emotional facial expressions .

26851130|Several studies using inhibitory avoidance models have demonstrated the importance of limbic structures , such as the amygdala , dorsal hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex , in the consolidation of emotional memory .

26844237|mGlu7 receptors , the most highly conserved isoform , are abundantly distributed in the brain , especially in regions , such as the amygdala , known to be crucial for the emotional processing of painful stimuli .

26835559|Modulatory interactions of opioids and norepinephrine -LRB- NE -RRB- in the anterior subdivision of the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLa -RRB- are critical for the consolidation of memories of emotionally arousing experiences .

26834606|In chronic pain , a number of brain regions involved in emotion -LRB- e.g. , amygdala , hippocampus , nucleus accumbens , insula , anterior cingulate , and prefrontal cortex -RRB- show significant functional and morphometric changes .

26834566|Recent studies combining pharmacological , behavioral , electrophysiological and molecular approaches indicate that depression results from maladaptive neuroplastic processes occurring in defined frontolimbic circuits responsible for emotional processing such as the prefrontal cortex , hippocampus , amygdala and ventral striatum .

26833918|Resting-state amygdala-lateral prefrontal cortex connectivity was altered and dissociation , as well as scores for ` lack of emotional awareness ' , decreased with training .

26833918|Results demonstrated that amygdala NF may improve healthy brain connectivity , as well as emotion regulation .

26833918|A randomized-controlled trial is needed to investigate whether amygdala NF is instrumental for improving neural regulation and emotion regulation in BPD patients .

26833658|Potential of zebrafish as a model for exploring the role of the amygdala in emotional memory and motivational behavior . .

26831814|Maltreatment is associated with reliable morphological alterations in anterior cingulate , dorsal lateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex , corpus callosum and adult hippocampus , and with enhanced amygdala response to emotional faces and diminished striatal response to anticipated rewards .

26828203|The Emotional Gatekeeper : A Computational Model of Attentional Selection and Suppression through the Pathway from the Amygdala to the Inhibitory Thalamic Reticular Nucleus . .

26828203|The amygdala , the hub of the brain 's emotional system , is involved in forming and signaling affective associations between stimuli and their consequences .

26828203|Here we used computational modeling to demonstrate how the amygdala-TRN pathway , embedded in a wider neural circuit , can mediate selective attention guided by emotions .

26828203|The model suggests that the amygdala-TRN projection can serve as a unique mechanism for emotion-guided selection of signals sent to cortex for further processing .

26826874|At-risk children also exhibited 1 -RRB- hypoconnectivity within the cognitive control network , which also lacked the typical anticorrelation with the default mode network ; 2 -RRB- hypoconnectivity between left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex ; and 3 -RRB- hyperconnectivity between the right amygdala and right inferior frontal gyrus , a key region for top-down modulation of emotion .

26826513|Our results showed that only the amygdala and the posterior superior temporal sulcus -LRB- STS -RRB- were able to accurately discriminate between these expressions , albeit in different ways : the amygdala discriminated fearful faces from non-fearful faces , whereas STS discriminated neutral from emotional -LRB- fearful , angry and happy -RRB- faces .

26826513|Taken together , our findings indicate that the decoding of facial emotion and facial identity occurs in different neural substrates : the amygdala and STS for the former and FFA and aIT for the latter .

26823966|Here , we investigated the functional connectivity of the amygdaloid social-perceptual input nuclei and emotion-regulation output nuclei in ASD versus controls .

26821063|Adult functional neuroimaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- studies have demonstrated associations between restricted sleep and neural alterations in the amygdala and reward circuitry when viewing emotional picture and face stimuli .

26821063|Consistent with our prediction , we also noted that emotion-dependent functional connectivity between the bilateral amygdala and prefrontal cortex , cingulate , fusiform , and occipital cortex was positively associated with sleep duration .

26821063|Paralleling similar studies in adults , these findings collectively suggest that decreased sleep duration in school-aged children may contribute to enhanced reactivity of brain regions involved in emotion and reward processing , as well as decreased emotion-dependent functional connectivity between the amygdala and brain regions associated with emotion regulation .

26819071|Group differences in global amygdala volumes were driven by local morphological increases in areas that are critically involved in face emotion processing and anxiety .

26809287|Neuroimaging results indicated that EXT was associated with hypo-activation in the amygdala and superior parietal lobule during both maintenance and reappraisal as well as poor modulation of the lateral occipital cortex during negative emotion reappraisal .

26806862|We hypothesized that acute exposure to blue wavelength light would directly affect the functioning of neurocircuity implicated in emotion regulation -LRB- i.e. , ventromedial prefrontal cortex , amygdala , insula , and anterior cingulate cortex -LSB- ACC -RSB- -RRB- during ` certain ' and ` uncertain ' anticipation of negative and positive stimuli .

26806013|On the neural level , disorder-related as compared with neutral scenes evoked differential responses in SAD patients in a widespread emotion processing network including -LRB- para - -RRB- limbic structures -LRB- e.g. amygdala , insula , thalamus , globus pallidus -RRB- and cortical regions -LRB- e.g. dorsomedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- dmPFC -RRB- , posterior cingulate cortex -LRB- PCC -RRB- , and precuneus -RRB- .

26804333|Compared to HCs , the combined patient group showed increased activation in amygdala , caudate and prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex while anticipating unspecific emotional stimuli .

26791254|In this study we examined the effects of mTBI on the amygdala , a brain structure known to be critically involved in the processing of emotional stimuli .

26778366|However , in response to emotional non-conflict , women recovered from AN relative to healthy controls showed significantly less activation in the bilateral amygdala .

26778366|Specifically , while emotional non-conflict evoked significant activations of the amygdala in healthy controls , recovered AN women did not show such activations .

26778366|Recovered women 's absence of amygdala and hippocampus activation during non-conflict trials possibly reflects an impaired ability to process emotional significant stimuli .

26771738|The neural circuitry associated with impaired emotion regulation is compared in individuals with and without substance disorders , with a focus on amygdala , insula , and prefrontal cortex activation and their functional and structural connectivity .

26771738|Although increased amygdala and insula activation is associated with impaired emotion regulation in individuals without substance disorders , it is not consistently observed in substance disorders .

26771046|Focusing , then , on studies involving the amygdala , a brain region that has attracted intense interest as a center for emotional processing , fear , and motivation , we discuss the features of the amygdala in brain networks for fear conditioning and emotional perception .

26769550|Higher trait anxiety was associated with stronger connections between the amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex , an area implicated in the generation of emotional reactions , and inferior temporal gyrus and paracentral lobule , areas associated with perceptual and sensory processing .

26769550|Thus , trait anxiety is not only associated with reduced amygdala connectivity with prefrontal areas associated with emotion modulation , but also enhanced connectivity with sensory areas .

26767708|Patients with irritable bowel syndrome showed disturbed amygdala resting-state functional connectivity with the corticolimbic regions , which could partly account for the enhanced emotional arousal and visceral information processing associated with irritable bowel syndrome .

26766958|The GAD patients showed impaired performance in WM task during emotional distracters and showed greater activation on brain regions such as DLPFC , VLPFC , amygdala , hippocampus which are responsible for the active maintenance of goal relevant information in WM and emotional processing .

26758831|Yet the mechanisms linking heightened amygdala activation to heightened emotional learning are elusive .

26757433|Activation was observed in the visual areas of the fusiform gyrus for all emotional scenes in both tasks , and in the amygdala for unpleasant scenes only .

26751119|Our results suggest that ELS alters functional activation of the thalamo-cortico-amydala pathway , as well as the emotional-arousal network -LRB- amygdala , locus coeruleus -RRB- , with evidence that ELS may additionally show sexually dimorphic effects on brain function .

26746624|Functional connectivity of the amygdala and subgenual cingulate during cognitive reappraisal of emotions in children with MDD history is associated with rumination . .

26741960|Orexin gene transfer into the amygdala suppresses both spontaneous and emotion-induced cataplexy in orexin-knockout mice . .

26741960|The neural circuit underlying cataplexy attacks is not known , but is likely to involve the amygdala , a region implicated in regulating emotions .

26741960|These results demonstrate that orexin gene transfer into amygdala neurons can suppress both spontaneous and emotion-induced cataplexy attacks in narcoleptic mice .

26740230|Serotonin neurons within the rostral DR are uniquely interconnected with brain areas associated with emotion and motivation such as the amygdala , accumbens and ventral pallidum .

26725925|Furthermore , emotional intent directly modulated functional connectivity of limbic and paralimbic areas such as the amygdala and insula .

26724568|Collectively we show a striking impact of central GLP-1 on emotionality and the amygdala serotonin signaling that is divergent under acute versus chronic GLP-1 activation conditions .

26707710|Survivors of TBI often experience cognitive and emotional deficits , suggesting that long-term effects of injury may disrupt neuronal function in critical brain regions , including the amygdala , which is involved in emotion and fear memory .

26696932|Given their tendency toward emotional hyperreactivity and altered amygdala and frontal activation , we hypothesized that individuals with BPD would demonstrate a distinct pattern of fMRI responses relative to those without BPD during the viewing of masked affective versus neutral faces in specific regions of interests -LRB- ROIs -RRB- .

26690589|Within-group analyses also revealed amygdalar and inferior frontal gyrus activations in controls , but not cannabis users , and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- deactivations in cannabis users , but not controls , during emotional evaluation , relative to neutral .

26685992|Assess the role of the amygdala in emotional responses .

26681358|During emotional resonance , the CD/CU + and ASD groups showed reduced amygdala responses compared to the TD controls , boys with ASD showed reduced responses in bilateral hippocampus , and the CD/CU + boys showed reduced responses in the inferior frontal gyrus -LRB- IFG -RRB- and anterior insula -LRB- AI -RRB- .

26681358|Decreased amygdala responses in ASD and CD/CU + might point to impaired emotion processing in both disorders , whereas reduced vmPFC responses suggest problems in processing cognitive aspects of empathy in ASD .

26679192|Specifically , we taught participants control over a key component of the emotion regulation network , in that they learned to increase top-down connectivity from the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex , which is involved in cognitive control , onto the amygdala , which is involved in emotion processing .

26674344|We provided substantial evidence indicating that synaptic plasticity in the dorsal ITC of amygdala allows for selective storage of salient emotional experiences , while it deters less-salient experience from entering long-term memory .

26668400|Long associated with emotion and vigilance , the amygdala has recently been implicated in both decision-making and social behavior .

26660113|Postnatal Stress Induced by Injection with Valproate Leads to Developing Emotional Disorders Along with Molecular and Cellular Changes in the Hippocampus and Amygdala . .

26660113|Our findings also shed light on early life stress to infants as a significant risk factor with regard to developing emotional disorders in youth , and that these effects may continue into adulthood , possibly due to altered gene expression and neuron-glia interaction occurring in the hippocampus and amygdala at an early age .

26655466|Anxiety is associated with activation in ventromedial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus , while fear is associated with activation in periaqueductal gray , with amygdala involved in processing aspects of both emotional responses .

26650182|Considered a multitask manager , the amygdala is a densely connected '' hub , '' coordinating and integrating tasks ranging from prompt , multisensorial emotion recognition to adequate emotional responses and emotional tuning of memories .

26650182|Although phylogenetically predisposed to handle fear , the amygdala handles both aversive and positive emotional inputs .

26650182|We propose that amygdalar -LRB- network -RRB- dysfunction contributes to reduced recognition of negative emotional face expressions , impaired theory of mind , reactive hypomimia , and impaired decision making .

26648907|The amygdala constitutes a brain area substantial for processing of emotional , especially fear-related signals .

26648907|The amygdala is also involved in neuroendocrine and autonomic functions , including skin conductance responses -LRB- SCRs -RRB- to emotionally arousing stimuli .

26648907|The results point to a defective modulation of sympathetic responses during emotional stimulation in patients with LE , probably due to impaired functioning of the amygdala .

26647971|Results indicated that although there were no group differences in self-reported attenuation of negative affect during cognitive reappraisal , relative to placebo , THC increased amygdala activation and reduced amygdala and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- dlPFC -RRB- functional coupling during cognitive reappraisal of emotionally negative pictures .

26645274|Evidence from functional neuroimaging studies of emotional perception shows that when attention is focused on external features of emotional stimuli -LRB- external perceptual orienting-EPO -RRB- , the amygdala is primarily engaged , but when attention is turned inwards towards one 's own emotional state -LRB- interoceptive self-orienting-ISO -RRB- , regions of the salience network , such as the anterior insula -LRB- AI -RRB- and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- dACC -RRB- , also play a major role .

26645274|The study yielded three main findings : -LRB- i -RRB- emotion boosted perception-related activity in the amygdala during both ISO and EPO and in the right AI exclusively during ISO ; -LRB- ii -RRB- emotion augmented activity predicting subsequent memory in AI and dACC during ISO but not during EPO and -LRB- iii -RRB- high confidence memory was associated with increased amygdala-dACC connectivity , selectively for ISO encoding .

26645207|Recent functional magnetic resonance -LRB- fMRI -RRB- imaging studies have revealed that subchronic medication with escitalopram leads to significant reduction in both amygdala and medial frontal gyrus reactivity during processing of emotional faces , suggesting that escitalopram may have a distinguishable modulatory effect on neural activation as compared with other serotonin-selective antidepressants .

26645207|In accordance with previous data , we showed that escitalopram exerts its rapid direct effect on emotional processing via attenuation of neural activation in pathways involving medial frontal gyrus and amygdala , an effect that seems to be distinguishable from that of other SSRIs .

26640766|Following this , 2 3-way ANOVAs -LRB- diagnosis-by-condition-by-emotion -RRB- were applied to context-dependent psychophysiological interaction -LRB- gPPI -RRB- analyses generated from a dorsomedial frontal cortex and an amygdala seed -LRB- identified from the BOLD response ANOVA main effects of condition and emotion respectively -RRB- .

26640766|However , analysis of gPPI data from an amygdala seed revealed decreased connectivity between amygdala and lentiform nucleus in the presence of emotional stimuli in children/adolescents with ADHD -LRB- diagnosis-by-emotion interaction -RRB- .

26624927|When considering the post-GnRHa scan only , depressive responses were associated with emotion-elicited activity in the anterior insula and amygdala .

26619965|During the delay interval under negative emotional distraction , both groups showed similar patterns of activations in the amygdala .

26618764|The basolateral limbic circuit -LRB- mediodorsal thalamic nucleus , anterior cingulated and prefrontal orbital cortex , anterior temporal cortex , and amygdala -RRB- , the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus circuit , and part of the frontal-subcortical circuits -LRB- anterior cingulate and prefrontal orbital cortex , caudate nucleus and nucleus accumbens , globus pallidus , and mediodorsal thalamic nucleus -RRB- , and the anterior cingulate and prefrontal orbital cortex circuit are crucial systems for forming and expressing emotions .

26609425|Recent evidence has suggested that propranolol may be effective in patients suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder by suppressing activity in the amygdala and thereby inhibiting emotional memory formation .

26606553|Dissociable contributions of amygdala and hippocampus to emotion and memory in patients with Alzheimer 's disease . .

26606553|The amygdala and the hippocampus are associated with emotional processing and declarative memory , respectively .

26606553|The current study aimed to investigate , for the first time , the roles of the amygdala and hippocampus in the dissociation between feelings of emotion and declarative memory for emotion-inducing events in patients with AD .

26606553|Sustained feelings of emotion and amygdala volume did not significantly differ between patients with AD and HCP .

26606553|Our findings suggest that the amygdala is important for regulating and sustaining an emotion independent of hippocampal function and declarative memory for the emotion-inducing event .

26606278|These data are relevant for showing an involvement of the amygdala and the hippocampus in emotional processing and provide additional neurochemical clues towards a more refined model of the functional circuitry of the human limbic system .

26595470|Internalizing pathology is related to alterations in amygdala resting state functional connectivity , potentially implicating altered emotional reactivity and/or emotion regulation in the etiological pathway .

26595470|Furthermore , amygdala connectivity longitudinally predicted anxiety symptoms and emotion regulation skills at a later follow-up .

26589451|This emotional modulation of decision-making was accompanied by a corresponding emotion-elicited increase in amygdala-striatal functional connectivity , which correlated with the behavioral effect across participants .

26589451|Consistent with prior reports of ` neural loss aversion ' , both amygdala and ventral striatum tracked losses more strongly than gains , and amygdala loss aversion signals were exaggerated by emotion , suggesting a potential role for this structure in integrating value and emotion cues .

26586374|Excitatory activity in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , a brain region that plays a central role in emotion and motivational processing , is tightly regulated by a relatively small population of ?-aminobutyric acid -LRB- GABA -RRB- inhibitory neurons .

26585964|The neural engine in this model is assumed to be based in frontal areas , specifically the orbitofrontal and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex , and in connections to limbic areas involved in emotions and reward , such as the ventral striatum and the amygdala .

26581384|Double immunofluorescence staining was used to reveal the density of IL-1? / NeuN -LRB- NeuN - a neuronal nuclear marker -RRB- - immunoreactive -LRB- ir -RRB- cells in the amygdaloid central -LRB- CeA -RRB- and medial -LRB- MeA -RRB- nuclei , which are closely involved in the regulation of emotional stressors and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis -LRB- HPA -RRB- activation .

26578781|The expression of serotonergic and GABAergic genes associated with emotional regulation in the amygdala was consistent with anxiety-like behavior in female , and partly in male PNA offspring .

26577285|For the control adolescents , brain activations associated with emotional arousal -LRB- amygdala -RRB- and cognitive effort -LRB- DMN -RRB- were both reduced at time_2 as compared to that at time_1 .

26568620|Both remote -LRB- childhood -RRB- and proximal -LRB- recent -RRB- adversities were differentially mirrored in morphometric changes in areas critically involved in emotional processing -LRB- i.e. amygdala/hippocampus , dorsal anterior cingulate cortex , respectively -RRB- .

26561939|We examined the relationship between both 5-HTTLPR genotype and in vivo 5-HTT binding quantified via PET with amygdala reactivity to emotionally negative stimuli .

26561939|In medication-free patients with current major depressive disorder -LRB- MDD ; N = 21 -RRB- , we determined 5-HTTLPR genotype , employed functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- to examine amygdala responses to negative emotional stimuli , and used positron emission tomography with -LSB- -LRB- 11 -RRB- C -RSB- DASB to examine 5-HTT binding .

26561939|5-HTTLPR S ' alleles were not associated with amygdala response to negative emotional stimuli .

26561939|Consistent with findings in healthy volunteers , 5-HTT binding is associated with amygdala reactivity to emotional stimuli in MDD .

26559000|Additionally , brain activity differences in regions involved in bottom-up reward and emotional processing , such as the nucleus accumbens and amygdala , have been shown in FHP individuals relative to their FHN peers .

26558785|Finally , identification of spatial and temporal differentiation of valence in amygdala may shed new insights into individual differences in emotional responding , with potential relevance for affective disorders .

26551661|These preliminary results suggest that aberrant emotional responding is modulated by noradrenergic plasticity within the amygdala-prefrontal cortex circuit , a neural substrate for the pharmacological treatment of PTSD .

26530305|The FSN and PSN groups possessed common emotion evocation circuits , including activation of the amygdala and inactivation of the infralimbic prefrontal cortex and ventral anterior cingulate cortex .

26525920|Contribution of amygdala pathology to comorbid emotional disturbances in temporal lobe epilepsy . .

26525920|Experimental and human positron emission tomography studies indicate changes in amygdala serotonergic , NPY Y1 receptor , neurokinin , and opioid systems in emotional disturbances in TLE .

26525920|These findings suggest a differential role of TLE-related amygdala changes in ictal and interictal emotional disturbances .

26514618|The right amygdala activity and its functional connectivity with the rostral anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- during implicit processing of negative emotional faces showed a significant relationship with previous verbal abuse experiences .

26513651|At the group level , metabolic dysfunction in the right amygdala , temporal pole , and middle cingulate cortex was highly correlated to the emotional recognition and attribution performances .

26500524|These results are the first to show effects of psychopathic traits on attention to the eyes of emotional faces in an adult male sample , and may support amygdala based accounts of psychopathy .

26500508|The amygdala plays a critical role in emotion processing and psychiatric disorders associated with emotion dysfunction .

26494872|The associations between brain activity , cognitive and emotional change , and outcome were analysed in 21 patients.ResultsPatients showed enhanced activity in the amygdala and ventral striatum compared with the control group .

26481674|Down-regulation of the amygdala with real-time fMRI neurofeedback -LRB- rtfMRI NF -RRB- potentially allows targeting brain circuits of emotion processing and may involve prefrontal-limbic networks underlying effective emotion regulation .

26481674|Taken together , the results underscore the potential of amygdala fMRI neurofeedback to influence functional connectivity in key networks of emotion processing and regulation .

26477647|Heightened amygdala response to salient social cues in OXTR A-allele carriers may elevate risk for emotional psychopathology by increasing amygdala involvement in disambiguating environmental cues , particularly for individuals with ELS .

26476262|The amygdala is a heterogeneous group of nuclei that plays a role in emotional and social learning .

26476009|The basolateral and lateral amygdala nuclei complex -LRB- BLC -RRB- is implicated in a number of emotional responses including conditioned fear and social anxiety .

26475872|Regulation of emotional responses is facilitated by the amygdala , which also modulates social decision-making , memory and attention .

26469872|The links between childhood cumulative risk exposure and elevated amygdala responses to emotionally neutral facial stimuli in adulthood were mediated by the corresponding amygdala volumes .

26464970|Presynaptic NR2A-Containing NMDARs Are Required for LTD between the Amygdala and the Perirhinal Cortex : A Potential Mechanism for the Emotional Modulation of Memory ?

26464970|How the lateral amygdala regulates recognition memory is not known , but synaptic plasticity at amygdala-perirhinal synapses may provide a mechanism for the emotional enhancement of recognition memory .

26464970|Therefore , the underlying mechanisms of LTD , at the amygdala-perirhinal input , which may regulate the emotional context for recognition memory , are different to previously described postsynaptic NR2B-NMDAR mechanisms of intraperirhinal LTD that subserve recognition memory .

26456416|They also had increased activation in several frontal , temporal , and parietal regions , but there was no evidence of amygdala activation in OCD or healthy participants and no significant between-group differences in performance on the emotion go/no-go task .

26454651|The amygdala is known to have a role in core processes regulated by the limbic system such as motivation , memory , emotion , social behavior , self-awareness as well as certain primitive instincts .

26441597|Significant gender differences were found in the left amygdala , where 23 % -LRB- n = 15 ? 66 -RRB- of neurons in men were significantly affected by facial emotion , vs. 8 % -LRB- n = 6 ? 76 -RRB- of neurons in women .

26441597|These differences may reflect gender-based distinctions in evolved capacities for emotional processing and also demonstrate the importance of including subject gender as an independent factor in future studies of emotional processing by single neurons in the human amygdala .

26441573|Our results show that the insular field underlying emotional expression is part of a network involving specific frontal , cingulate , temporal , and parietal areas , as well as the amygdala , the basal ganglia , and thalamus , indicating that this sector of the insula is a site of integration of motor , emotional , sensory and social information .

26440605|During down-regulation of negative emotions , wide areas of the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- inhibit emotion-related brain areas such as the amygdala .

26436717|Consistent with this behavioral profile , two core emotional brain regions , the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex , show little structural and functional decline in aging , compared with other regions .

26424431|The amygdala , a crucial hub of the emotional processing neural system , has been implicated in late-life depression -LRB- LLD -RRB- pathophysiology .

26421634|Reductions in depressive symptoms after 1 week of active placebo treatment , compared with the inactive , were associated with increased placebo-induced µ-opioid neurotransmission in a network of regions implicated in emotion , stress regulation , and the pathophysiology of MDD , namely , the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex , nucleus accumbens , midline thalamus , and amygdala -LRB- nucleus accumbens : r = 0.6 ; P < .001 -RRB- .

26417770|The volumes of putative emotional processing regions including the amygdala , hippocampus and anterior cingulate show no difference between psychotic and nonpsychotic depression .

26417673|We found that compared with the disgusted faces of in-groups , the disgusted faces of out-groups result in increased amygdala and insular engagement , positive coupling of the insula with amygdala-based emotional system , and negative coupling of the insula with anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- - based regulatory system .

26415997|A possible model of habituation to tinnitus is described , that of the attention system -LRB- via the frontal cortex -RRB- suppressing the response from the amygdala and the use of alternate nodes of the limbic system such as the insula and the parahippocampal gyrus when mediating emotion .

26409130|Several studies suggest that highly emotional information could facilitate long-term memory encoding and consolidation processes via an amygdala-hippocampal network .

26406311|In this study , we use resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to test the hypothesis of diminished functional integration within the affective/limbic network -LRB- which includes the amygdala , hippocampus , subgenual cingulate cortex , orbitofrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens -RRB- of children with ADHD , which is associated with their behavioral measures of emotional control deficits .

26406106|The amygdala is a hub in emotional processing , including that of negative affect .

26404844|Intranasal Oxytocin Administration Dampens Amygdala Reactivity towards Emotional Faces in Male and Female PTSD Patients . .

26404844|As a first step to investigate the therapeutic potential of OT in PTSD , we conducted a double-blind , placebo-controlled , cross-over functional MRI study examining OT administration effects -LRB- 40 IU -RRB- on amygdala reactivity toward emotional faces in unmedicated male and female police officers with -LRB- n = 37 , 21 males -RRB- and without -LRB- n = 40 , 20 males -RRB- PTSD .

26404844|OT administration dampened amygdala reactivity toward all emotional faces in male and female PTSD patients , but enhanced amygdala reactivity in healthy male and female trauma-exposed controls , independent of sex and stimulus valence .

26402610|The dynamic interactions between hippocampus and amygdala are critical for emotional memory .

26401721|In this first investigation of the neural correlates of CACNA1C in young individuals , we examined associations between two single nucleotide polymorphisms in CACNA1C -LRB- rs1006737 and rs4765914 -RRB- with amygdala volume and activation during an emotional processing task in 58 adolescents and young adults 13-20 years of age .

26401721|Furthermore , minor -LRB- A -RRB- allele homozygotes of rs1006737 exhibited increased blood-oxygen-level-dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- signal in the amygdala when viewing negative -LRB- vs. neutral -RRB- stimuli -LRB- ? = 0.29 , p = 0.040 -RRB- and decreased BOLD signal in the amygdala when instructed to downregulate their emotional response to negative stimuli -LRB- ? = -0.38 , p = 0.009 -RRB- .

26400857|As expected , we showed that the STN is functionally connected to the structures involved in emotional prosody decoding , notably the orbitofrontal cortex , inferior frontal gyrus , auditory cortex , pallidum and amygdala .

26382634|Effects of intranasal oxytocin on amygdala reactivity to emotional faces in recently trauma-exposed individuals . .

26382634|Since oxytocin modulates amygdala reactivity to emotional stimuli , oxytocin administration early post-trauma may be a promising candidate for PTSD prevention .

26365505|The amygdala is essential for generating emotional-affective behaviors .

26359718|Presenting minute , subthreshold negative -LRB- vs. neutral -RRB- cues in faces and odors , we demonstrated olfactory-visual emotion integration in improved emotion detection -LRB- especially among individuals with weaker perception of unimodal negative cues -RRB- and response enhancement in the amygdala .

26359718|Moreover , while perceptual gain for visual negative emotion involved the posterior superior temporal sulcus/pSTS , perceptual gain for olfactory negative emotion engaged both the associative olfactory -LRB- orbitofrontal -RRB- cortex and amygdala .

26354922|Remarkably , tutoring remediated aberrant functional responses and connectivity in emotion-related circuits anchored in the basolateral amygdala .

26354922|Here , we demonstrate that intensive 8 week one-to-one cognitive tutoring not only reduces math anxiety but also remarkably remediates aberrant functional responses and connectivity in emotion-related circuits anchored in the amygdala .

26350954|Specifically , the left hippocampus was segmented into three distinct clusters : an emotional processing cluster supported by structural and functional connectivity to the amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus , a cognitive operations cluster , with functional connectivity to the anterior cingulate and inferior frontal gyrus , and a posterior perceptual cluster with distinct structural connectivity patterns to the occipital lobe coupled with functional connectivity to the precuneus and angular gyrus .

26346640|In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled between-subjects functional magnetic resonance -LRB- fMRI -RRB- study , we assessed the effects of a single intranasal oxytocin administration -LRB- 40 IU -RRB- on seed-based amygdala resting-state FC with emotion regulation areas -LRB- ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- , ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- vlPFC -RRB- -RRB- , and salience processing areas -LRB- insula , dorsal anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- dACC -RRB- -RRB- in 37 individuals within 11 days post trauma .

26346195|The superficial amygdala -LRB- SFA -RRB- is important in human emotion/affective processing via its strong connection with other limbic and cerebral cortex for receptive and expressive emotion processing .

26346195|Our results suggest that the amygdala can not be treated as a single unit in human neuroimaging studies and that TSD may alter the functional connectivity pattern of the SFA , which in turn disrupts emotional regulation .

26343598|Impulsive aggressive behavior is thought to be facilitated by activation of the limbic brain , particularly the amygdala and hippocampus. , Functional imaging studies suggest abnormalities in limbic brain activity during emotional information processing in impulsively aggressive subjects with Intermittent Explosive Disorder -LRB- IED -RRB- .

26341317|The VTA projects to areas involved in cognitive and emotional processes , including hippocampus , amygdala , nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex , and has thus been proposed to play a role in emotional memory impairments in PD .

26336869|Gene × Environment × Timing -LRB- G × E × T -RRB- interactions -LRB- p = 0.00022 after Hochberg correction -RRB- were found in ventral orbital cortex , cingulate cortex , external capsule , amygdala and dentate gyrus and in the emotion regulation measures .

26334650|Our findings are compatible with and expand previous results reported by studies that have taken a task-related fMRI approach , furthering our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms of attachment , and in particular implicating the system formed by amygdala and prefrontal areas in the patterns of behavior that regulate emotional proximity in romantic relationships .

26330494|This relatively small population of cells sends widespread projections throughout the brain including to a number of regions such as the amygdala which is involved in emotional associative learning and the medial prefrontal cortex which is important for facilitating flexibility when learning rules change .

26330494|Furthermore , noradrenaline in mPFC and amygdala has distinct effects on emotional learning and cognitive flexibility .

26325007|Early weaning in rodents reportedly influences behavioral and emotional traits and triggers precocious myelin formation in the anterior basolateral amygdala -LRB- aBLA ; Ono et al. , 2008 -RRB- , where prefrontal efferents terminate .

26320029|All together , the data indicate that astrocytes are also an important target of stress , with both chronic and acute stressors being able to alter the morphology or the expression of several astrocyte specific proteins in brain areas that are known to play a critical role in emotional processing , such as the prefrontal cortex , hippocampus and amygdala .

26318628|As the dmPFC is involved in social cognition and action planning , and the amygdala-in threat detection , the connectivity results suggest that compared to women , men have a more evaluative , rather than purely affective , brain response during negative emotion processing .

26318100|These studies have shown that HR rats are more susceptible to the anxiogenic effects of chronic corticosterone administration , which are associated with the attenuation of GABAergic control over the amygdala output that controls emotional responses .

26315447|Namely , it argues that phenomenological training leading to reflexive introspection and verbalization of our susceptibility to noise might have three-fold implication - -LRB- i -RRB- it will generate deeper understanding of noise sensitivity which will then allow us to deduce a hierarchical structure of meaning and concepts to supplement and be fed to quantitative research , -LRB- ii -RRB- it will provide better interpretation of neuroimaging and electroencephalographic data related to noise reaction and perception , which in turn will allow a process of reciprocal validation , -LRB- iii -RRB- and , most importantly , it presents a promising technique for emotional regulation of noise processing via modulation of the amygdalar function , when a state of awareness of this processing has been achieved .

26314945|We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the dynamic functional interactions between the amygdala , the nucleus accumbens , and the prefrontal cortex that underlie the influences of emotions , desires , and rationality on human decisions .

26314945|We found that increased functional connectivity between the amygdala and the nucleus accumbens facilitated the approach of an immediate reward in the presence of emotional information .

26314945|These findings support previous animal studies by demonstrating that emotional signals from the amygdala and goal-oriented information from prefrontal cortices interface in the nucleus accumbens to guide human decisions and reward-directed actions .

26313424|Strong evidence indicates that reciprocal connections between the amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- support fundamental aspects of emotional behavior in adulthood .

26313134|Evidence of an IFN-? by early life stress interaction in the regulation of amygdala reactivity to emotional stimuli . .

26313134|Importantly , interaction analyses revealed a specific interaction between IFN? genotype -LRB- rs1861494 -RRB- and early life stress affecting amygdala reactivity to emotional faces , resulting from a positive association between CTQ scores and amygdala reactivity in C allele carriers while this association was absent in T homozygotes .

26313134|Our findings indicate that firstly the genetic variant of IFN? -LRB- rs1861494 -RRB- is involved with the regulation of amygdala reactivity to emotional stimuli and secondly , that this genetic variant moderates effects of early life stress on emotion processing .

26311778|Pathways for Emotions : Specializations in the Amygdalar , Mediodorsal Thalamic , and Posterior Orbitofrontal Network . .

26311778|The indirect pathway from the amygdala to pOFC via MDmc may provide information about the emotional significance of events and , along with a parallel direct pathway , ensures transfer of signals to all layers of pOFC .

26311778|The amygdala-the brain 's center for emotions-is strongly linked with the orbital cortex , a region associated with social interactions .

26311432|Here we focus on potentially beneficial effects of activating small-conductance calcium-activated potassium -LRB- SK -RRB- channels in the amygdala , a brain center of emotions that plays an important role in central pain modulation and processing .

26300749|We analyzed c-Fos protein expression in several brain regions after each of these tests , and found that , unlike B6 mice , BTBR mice react to a stressed cagemate exposure in the Transfer of Emotional Information test with no increase of c-Fos expression in either the prefrontal cortex or the amygdala .

26299298|Youth with BD have abnormal amygdala resting state network connections to regions that are critical for emotional processing and self-awareness .

26291167|Here we show that the amygdala , a brain area traditionally thought to mediate emotions , also encodes abstract information that could underlie this flexibility .

26290235|Animal data suggest that the amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex are key regions in promoting emotion-induced cataplectic attacks .

26290235|In narcolepsy caused by hypocretin/orexin deficiency , cataplexy is associated with a marked increase in neural activity in the amygdala , the nucleus accumbens , and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex , which represent suprapontine centers that physiologically process emotions and reward .

26290235|The comparison of cataplexy versus laugh episodes revealed the involvement of a corticolimbic network that processes reward and emotion encompassing the anterior insular cortex , the nucleus accumbens , and the amygdala .

26284742|Using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiological techniques in brain slices , we also characterized glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission in the basolateral amygdala , a brain region that has been implicated to play a role in emotional behavior .

26284026|The amygdala is central for the generation of adequate homoeostatic behavioral responses to emotionally significant external stimuli following processing in a variety of parallel neuronal circuits .

26284026|Here , we hypothesize that adaptive cellular and humoral autoimmunity may target and modulate distinct inhibitory or excitatory neuronal networks within the amygdala , and thereby strongly impact processing of emotional stimuli and corresponding behavioral responses .

26276414|The purpose of this study was to determine whether children with epilepsy surgery in their history are able to recognize emotions expressed by faces and whether this recognition is associated with demographic variables -LSB- age , sex , and verbal intelligence -LRB- VIQ -RRB- -RSB- and/or epilepsy variables -LRB- epilepsy duration , side of the surgery , surgery area , resection of the amygdala , etiology , antiepileptic drug use , and seizure freedom -RRB- .

26275382|Moreover , structural covariance patterns between the left amygdala and other emotion-related brain regions differed markedly between alexithymia and empathy .

26260664|Third , neurobiological data indicate that reciprocal amygdalar-hippocampal influences underlie such mutual regulation of emotion and cognition .

26260664|While supporting this view , the present review discusses experimental data , obtained in rodents , indicating that the hippocampal and amygdalar systems not only regulate each other and their functional outcomes , but also qualify specific emotional memory representations through specific activations and interactions .

26260664|Hence , beyond the mutual quantitative regulation of these two brain systems described so far , we develop the idea that different activations of the hippocampus and amygdala , leading to specific configurations of neural activity , qualitatively impact the formation of emotional memory representations , thereby producing either adaptive or maladaptive fear memories .

26257641|However , our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the effects of alcohol on synaptic plasticity is limited by the fact that the NAc receives glutamatergic inputs from distinct brain regions -LRB- e.g. , the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFCx -RRB- , the amygdala and the hippocampus -RRB- , each region providing different information -LRB- e.g. , spatial , emotional and cognitive -RRB- .

26245837|Using functional magnetic resonance imaging , we evaluated independent and interactive effects of the 5-HTTLPR genotype and neuroticism on amygdala functional connectivity during an emotional faces paradigm in 76 healthy individuals .

26244883|Furthermore , BP showed decreased activation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- during the monitoring and a lack of bilateral amygdala deactivation during the resolution of the emotional conflict .

26244883|Overall , our results highlighted dysfunctional processing of the emotion conflict in euthymic BP that may be subtended by abnormal activity and connectivity of the DLPFC during the conflict monitoring , which , in turn , leads to failure of amygdala deactivation during the resolution of the conflict .

26231911|Getting Over It : Long-Lasting Effects of Emotion Regulation on Amygdala Response . .

26231911|As in prior work , active reappraisal increased prefrontal responses but decreased amygdala responses and self-reported emotion .

26231911|These results suggest that reappraisal can exert long-lasting '' dose-dependent '' effects on amygdala response that may cause lasting changes in the neural representation of an unpleasant event 's emotional value .

26224780|It has been suggested that some cortically blind patients can process the emotional valence of visual stimuli via a fast , subcortical pathway from the superior colliculus -LRB- SC -RRB- that reaches the amygdala via the pulvinar .

26223500|We employed the MAGL knock-out mouse -LRB- MAGL - / - -RRB- , a genetic model of congenital and sustained elevation of 2-AG levels in the brain , to provide morphological and biochemical evidence for ?-arrestin2-mediated CB1 R desensitization in brain regions involved in the control of emotional states , that is , the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- , amygdala , hippocampus and cerebellar cortex .

26220746|Our results revealed robust brain selectivity to emotional compared to neutral gait stimuli in brain regions which are involved in emotion and biological motion processing , such as the extrastriate body area -LRB- EBA -RRB- , fusiform body area -LRB- FBA -RRB- , superior temporal sulcus -LRB- STS -RRB- , and the amygdala -LRB- AMG -RRB- .

26220746|Brain activity in the amygdala reflected emotional awareness : for visually identical stimuli it showed amplified stronger response when the stimulus was perceived as emotional .

26220746|Notably , in avatars gradually morphed along an emotional expression axis there was a parametric correlation between amygdala activity and emotional intensity .

26220024|Here , we investigate how current cocaine use affects amygdala activity and amygdala connectivity with the prefrontal cortex in response to biologically salient stimuli in an emotional face matching task -LRB- EFMT -RRB- .

26220024|High amygdala activation to emotional face processing in current cocaine users may result from low prefrontal control of the amygdala response to such stimuli .

26218827|The medial nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- Me -RRB- is a component of the neural circuit for the interpretation of multimodal sensory stimuli and the elaboration of emotions and social behaviors in primates .

26217205|The role of the amygdala in the perception of positive emotions : an .

26217205|The specific role of the amygdala remains controversial even though the development of functional imaging techniques has established its implication in the emotional process .

26217205|The aim of this study was to highlight the sensitivity of the amygdala to emotional intensity -LRB- arousal -RRB- .

26217205|We conducted an analysis of the modulation of amygdala activation according to variation in emotional intensity via an fMRI event-related protocol .

26217205|We demonstrated that the left and right amygdalae were sensitive to changes in emotional intensity , activating more in response to stimuli with higher intensity .

26217205|These results highlight the sensitivity of the amygdala to the intensity of positively valenced visual stimuli , and in conjunction with results in the literature on negative emotions , reinforce the role of the amygdala in the perception of intensity .

26210693|When participants were administered escitalopram -LRB- relative to a placebo -RRB- and asked to reappraise negative emotional stimuli , left amygdala activation was decreased and right inferior frontal gyrus -LRB- R IFG -RRB- activation was increased .

26208842|Among these , the relationship between the amygdala and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- vlPFC -RRB- has recently gained focus with regard to emotion regulation .

26208842|Thus , in this study , we examined the response properties of single neurons in the amygdala and vlPFC while presenting video clips of three types of facial emotions -LRB- aggressive threat , coo , and scream -RRB- in Macaca mulatta .

26208842|Information analyses revealed that the amount of information conveyed by the amygdala neurons about the type of emotion transiently increased immediately after stimulus presentation .

26208842|Therefore , our results suggest that the amygdala processes strong emotion roughly but rapidly , whereas the vlPFC spends a great deal of time processing ambiguous facial information in communication , and make an accurate decision from multiple possibilities based on memory .

26196669|Further , activity within the PFC , as well as other regions including the amygdala , were linked with the peripheral emotional response as indexed by skin conductance and electromyography .

26194419|To achieve this end , we focus on the interaction of parental care and the developing amygdala-medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- network-that is at the core of human emotional functioning .

26184761|In particular , amygdala , orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- and lateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- LPFC -RRB- seem to be essential in human decision making , where both emotional and cognitive aspects are taken into account .

26184761|In our model , the neurodynamic activity of amygdala and OFC represents the neural correlates of secondary emotion , while the activity of certain neural populations in OFC alone represents the outcome expectancy of different options .

26184083|The mammalian amygdala is a key emotional brain region for eliciting social behaviour , critically involved in anxiety and fear-related behaviours , and hence a focus of research on neurodevelopmental and stress-related disorders such as autism and anxiety .

26179894|More specifically , the recent research suggests that both types of information involuntarily orient attention due to their concern relevance and that the amygdala plays an important role in detecting concern-relevant stimuli , thereby enhancing perceptual processing and influencing emotional attentional processes .

26179507|In conclusion , studies of the hypothalamic parvafox nucleus will reveal whether this entity represents the fulcrum for positive emotions , as is the amygdala for fear and the insula for disgust .

26175756|It has been suggested that emotional visual input is processed along both a slower cortical pathway and a faster subcortical pathway which comprises the lateral geniculate nucleus -LRB- LGN -RRB- , the superior colliculus , the pulvinar , and finally the amygdala .

26174294|It is unknown how propofol affects the amygdala-dependent emotional memory system , which modulates consolidation in the hippocampus in response to emotional arousal and neurohumoral stress .

26174294|Propofol had no effect on the stereotypical amygdalar response to emotional arousal , but caused marked suppression of the hippocampal response .

26174294|Propofol is relatively ineffective at suppressing amygdalar activation at sedative doses , but abolishes emotional modulation and causes amnesia via mechanisms that commonly involve hyporesponsiveness of the hippocampus .

26171717|Importantly , age-dependent decreases in dmPFC activation and amygdala-vmPFC connectivity may indicate abnormal developmental processes in key emotion pathways in pediatric PTSD .

26155668|The survey also gives information about changes in the exchange of serotonine in the Amygdala 's structures in the process of alimentary , maternal , aggressive-defensive and emotional behavior .

26141844|Centromedial amygdala inactivation reduced the cSNC effect and increased exploratory behavior in the open field , both effects consistent with a reduction in negative emotional state .

26124712|Childhood Poverty Predicts Adult Amygdala and Frontal Activity and Connectivity in Response to Emotional Faces . .

26120848|It is thought that these emotional consequences are caused in part by increased amygdala reactivity .

26113614|Preparing to view elicited activation in regions including nucleus accumbens , whereas visual regions and bilateral amygdala were activated during viewing of emotional pictures .

26112339|Altered amygdala-prefrontal response to facial emotion in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder . .

26112339|The activation analyses revealed greater right amygdala activation to emotional faces versus shapes in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder and offspring of non-bipolar parents than healthy controls .

26112339|Given that abnormally increased amygdala activation during emotion processing characterized offspring of both patient groups , and that abnormally increased amygdala activation has often been reported in individuals with already developed bipolar disorder and those with major depressive disorder , these neuroimaging findings may represent markers of increased risk for affective disorders in general .

26112339|The analysis of psychophysiological interaction revealed that offspring of parents with bipolar disorder showed significantly more negative right amygdala-anterior cingulate cortex functional connectivity to emotional faces versus shapes , but significantly more positive right amygdala-left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex functional connectivity to happy faces -LRB- all P-values corrected for multiple tests -RRB- than offspring of non-bipolar parents and healthy controls .

26108101|Individual differences in common factors of emotional traits and executive functions predict functional connectivity of the amygdala . .

26108101|To investigate whether this interplay between emotional traits and executive functions is reflected in neural connectivity , we used resting-state fMRI to explore the functional connectivity of the amygdala as a starting point , and progressed to other seed-based analyses based on the initial findings .

26108101|We found that the first factor predicted the strength of connectivity between brain regions known to be involved in the cognitive control of emotion , including the amygdala and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , whereas the second factor predicted the strength of connectivity between brain regions known to be involved in reward and attention , including the amygdala , the caudate and the thalamus .

26106525|Two neural regions , involved in behavioral control and emotion regulation , are often implicated : amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- VMPFC -RRB- .

26106363|In conclusion , amygdala swelling , retrograde biographic memory impairment , accelerated long-term forgetting , and emotional instability may serve as indicators of limbic encephalitis , even in the absence of overt epileptic seizures .

26099305|Dexmedetomidine Dose-Dependently Attenuates Ropivacaine-Induced Seizures and Negative Emotions Via Inhibiting Phosphorylation of Amygdala Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase in Mice . .

26098873|Furthermore , it was not reducible to activity in traditional '' emotion-related '' regions -LRB- e.g. , amygdala , insula -RRB- or resting-state networks -LRB- e.g. , '' salience , '' '' default mode '' -RRB- .

26097448|Other structures in the medial temporal lobe , especially the amygdala , have been more specifically linked with emotional dimension of episodic memories , reported by interoception .

26092780|Patients showed less mPFC activation during processing of emotional faces compared to controls , whereas no differences were found in amygdala activation .

26092091|Our understanding of how cannabinoids influence memory comes predominantly from studies examining cognitive and emotional memory systems mediated by the hippocampus and amygdala , respectively .

26087850|Although these alterations may account for abnormal activity in brain regions implicated in emotion dysregulation , such as the amygdala , anterior cingulate cortex and prefrontal cortex , it remains to be determined whether these alterations are specific for BPD .

26083379|Both strategies attenuated amygdala responses to emotional triggers , but the pathways to regulation differed across the two .

26079070|Furthermore , emotions are able to influence memory processing in a crucial way through the involvement of the amygdala .

26079070|Our research aims to contribute to the neurobiological body of knowledge on acquisition and retrieval of emotional memory via the histaminergic amygdaloid system in mice .

26074298|Five out of the seven emotions demonstrated consistent activation within the amygdala , whereas all emotions consistently activated the right inferior frontal gyrus , which has been implicated as an integration hub for affective and cognitive processes .

26060327|Forty healthy older adults completed stress questionnaires , a social network interview and structural MRI to investigate the amygdala-medial prefrontal cortex circuitry , which is implicated in social and emotional processing and negatively affected by stress .

26058355|Evidence converges on the role of subcortical structures of old evolutionary origin such as the superior colliculus , the pulvinar and the amygdala in mediating affective blindsight and nonconscious perception of emotions .

26053697|Evidence suggests that EI is mediated extensively by the interplay of key emotion regions including the amygdala , insula , and ventromedial prefrontal cortex , among others .

26048001|Here we review recent studies on adolescent nicotine which show that the adolescent brain is differentially sensitive to nicotine-induced alterations in dendritic elaboration , in several brain areas associated with processing reinforcement and emotion , specifically including nucleus accumbens , medial prefrontal cortex , basolateral amygdala , bed nucleus of the stria terminalis , and dentate gyrus .

26042738|FMRI data showed greater activation in the left amygdala , bilateral insula , medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- , dorsal anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , and left opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus during emotional interference of the current trial in SAD patients .

26041829|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is a complex brain region associated with processing emotional states , such as fear , anxiety , and stress .

26037668|Chronic nicotine administration induced a marked region-specific upregulation of the oxytocin receptor binding in the amygdala , a brain region involved in stress and emotional regulation .

26030426|Activation of the amygdala either during emotional arousal or by direct stimulation is thought to enhance memory in part by modulating plasticity in the hippocampus .

26027740|OCD patients compared with controls showed altered amygdala responsiveness during symptom provocation and diminished left dlPFC activity and frontal-amygdala connectivity during emotion regulation .

26017750|The amygdala plays an important role in emotion processing and in the activation of the frontal lobe .

26017750|We hypothesised that smaller amygdala volumes in ADHD patients would be associated with less control of impulsivity and emotional instability .

26017750|Our results suggest that greater emotional processing and less control of impulsivity are associated with smaller amygdala volumes in ADHD patients .

26011391|Activity in the amygdala in response to negative emotion was marginally reduced after exposure to happy primes compared with angry primes .

26010458|Further investigation revealed that patients demonstrated increased FC between the PCC and several brain regions implicated in pain , sensory , motor , and emotion regulation processes -LRB- eg , insular cortex , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , thalamus , globus pallidus , putamen , amygdala , hippocampus -RRB- .

25999908|Furthermore , the morphoanatomical measures of amygdala and hippocampus predict some features of dream contents -LRB- bizarreness , vividness , and emotional load -RRB- .

25999363|Resting-state functional connectivity was measured with amygdala and dorsolateral prefrontal cortical -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- seed regions frequently associated with emotion regulation .

25999363|Across participants , more successful reappraisal correlated with less trait anxiety and more positive daily emotion , greater activation in medial and lateral prefrontal regions , and lesser resting-state functional connectivity between -LRB- a -RRB- right amygdala and both medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices , and -LRB- b -RRB- bilateral DLPFC and posterior visual cortices .

25982833|STN HFS only activated c-Fos in the globus pallidus and the basolateral amygdala , highlighting a possible role on emotional processes via the amygdala , with a limited effect by itself in other structures .

25978492|Affective resonance in response to others ' emotional faces varies with affective ratings and psychopathic traits in amygdala and anterior insula . .

25978492|When instructed to rate their own affective response to others ' faces , participants recruited anterior insula , dorsal anterior cingulate , inferior frontal gyrus , and amygdala , regions consistently implicated in studies investigating empathy for disgust and pain , as well as emotional saliency .

25978492|Importantly , responses in anterior insula and amygdala were modulated by trial-by-trial variations in subjective affective responses to the emotional facial stimuli .

25978492|Our findings suggest that anterior insula and amygdala play important roles in the generation of affective internal states in response to others ' emotional cues and that attenuated function in these regions may underlie reduced empathy in individuals with high levels of psychopathic traits .

25976370|Considering the role of amygdala in emotion processing , the impairment in amygdalostriatal connectivity strongly suggests that emotional disturbances could occur in HD mice .

25973783|The amygdala is repeatedly implicated as a critical component of the neurocircuitry regulating emotional valence .

25972795|These changes may be related to alteration in the interaction between hippocampus and amygdala in regulating negative emotions .

25969533|Although the amygdala is often directly linked with fear and emotion , amygdala neurons are activated by a wide variety of emotional and non-emotional stimuli .

25969533|Different subregions within the amygdala may be engaged preferentially by different aspects of emotional and non-emotional tasks .

25964498|Here , we examined evoked amygdala responses to gaze and facial emotion changes in five epileptic patients with intracerebral electrodes .

25963733|The DR and MR seeds produced largely similar FC maps : significant positive FC with brain regions involved in cognitive and emotion processing including anterior cingulate , amygdala , insula , hippocampus , thalamus , basal ganglia and cerebellum .

25962860|The prefrontal cortex is a crucial area in this regulation process , given that it exerts a top-down influence on the amygdala and other subcortical structures involved in emotion processing .

25962831|Results indicated : -LRB- 1 -RRB- significantly reduced levels of brain activation in participants with ASD in medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- MPFC -RRB- and superior temporal gyrus -LRB- STG -RRB- during implicit emotion processing ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- significantly weaker functional connectivity in the ASD group in connections of the MPFC with the amygdala , temporal lobe , parietal lobe , and fusiform gyrus ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- No group difference in performance accuracy or reaction time ; and -LRB- 4 -RRB- Significant positive relationship between empathizing ability and STG activity in ASD but not in typically developing participants .

25956869|In zebrafish the medial pallium of the dorsal telencephalon represents an amygdala homolog structure , which is crucially involved in emotional associative learning and memory .

25955025|This study presents three significant findings that advance our understanding and evaluation of TBI : 1 -RRB- the introduction of a new method to identify highly localized disturbances in discrete gray matter , subcortical brain nuclei without postmortem histology , 2 -RRB- the use of this method to demonstrate that separate injuries to the rostral and caudal cortex produce the same subcortical , disturbances , and 3 -RRB- the central nucleus of the amygdala , critical in the regulation of emotion , is vulnerable to concussion .

25943482|Early research involving brain lesion studies in animals lead to the idea that the auditory cortex participates in emotional learning by processing the sensory features of auditory stimuli paired with emotional consequences and by transmitting this information to the amygdala .

25943482|In particular , we analyze the possible roles of the auditory cortex in emotional learning , we examine the recruitment of the auditory cortex during early and late memory trace encoding , and finally we consider the functional interplay between the auditory cortex and subcortical nuclei , such as the amygdala , that process affective information .

25935068|Compared with HC , BPD patients showed relatively increased activation of the left amygdala and posterior cingulate cortex , along with blunted responses of the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , during the processing of negative emotional stimuli .

25929825|The effects of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism on neural responses to emotionally salient faces have been studied extensively , focusing on amygdala reactivity and amygdala-prefrontal interactions .

25929825|We observed robust increased response to emotional faces in the amygdala , hippocampus , caudate , fusiform gyrus , superior temporal sulcus and lateral prefrontal and occipito-parietal cortices .

25924614|The rat posterodorsal medial amygdala -LRB- MePD -RRB- has a remarkable neuronal plasticity and responds to olfactory/pheromonal stimuli to modulate emotional and reproductive behaviors .

25924614|Our results are different from the distribution of glutamate receptors in the amygdaloid lateral nucleus , an upstream area involved with emotional processing , and suggest a region-specific excitatory transmission at proximal and distal dendritic branches .

25916250|Verbal emotional memory in a case with left amygdala damage . .

25916250|The amygdala nuclei appear to be critically implicated in emotional memory .

25916250|We thus studied the verbal emotional memory in a young woman with a ganglioglioma of the left amygdala and analyzed its impact -LRB- 1 -RRB- on each step of the memory process -LRB- encoding , retrieval , and recognition -RRB- -LRB- 2 -RRB- on short - and long-term consolidation -LRB- 1-hour and 1-week delay -RRB- and -LRB- 3 -RRB- on processing of valence -LRB- positive and negative items compared to neutral words -RRB- .

25913703|Across both studies activity in the amygdala was associated with empathic regulation towards others ' emotional pain , but not their physical pain .

25913703|In addition , psychophysiological interaction -LRB- PPI -RRB- analysis and Granger causal modeling -LRB- GCM -RRB- showed that amygdala activity while reading about others ' emotional pain was preceded by and positively coupled with activity in the theory of mind brain regions , and followed by and negatively coupled with activity in regions associated with physical pain and bodily sensations .

25913703|Previous work has shown that the amygdala is critically involved in the deliberate control of self-focused distress - the current results extend the central importance of amygdala activity to the control of other-focused empathy , but only when considering others ' emotional pain .

25906795|Decreased stress levels and amygdala activity after incision support the assumption of an influence of NSSI on emotion regulation in individuals with borderline personality disorder and aids in understanding why these patients use self-inflicted pain to reduce inner tension .

25894655|Although the central pathways of emotional sweating are not yet elucidated in detail , it is thought that the amygdala , cingulate cortex , and medulla participate via efferent fibers that descend through the spinal cord and connect to preganglionic sympathetic neurons in the nucleus intermediolateralis .

25894655|The limbic system , including the amygdala and cingulate cortex , is critical for emotional processing and many cognitive functions .

25875758|A large corpus of research suggests that there are changes in the manner and degree to which the amygdala supports cognitive and emotional function across development .

25868002|The amygdala , hippocampus , and medial prefrontal cortex are limbic brain regions connected by the uncinate fasciculus -LRB- UF -RRB- and implicated in emotion regulation .

25859660|We found increased amygdala activation to negative emotions in CD compared to healthy controls in region of interest analyses , which persisted over time consistent with previous findings using emotional paradigms .

25853490|Analyses of the activity patterns encoded in the model revealed that each emotion category is associated with unique , prototypical patterns of activity across multiple brain systems including the cortex , thalamus , amygdala , and other structures .

25852541|Impaired emotional autobiographical memory associated with right amygdalar-hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer 's disease patients . .

25852541|We studied the influence of emotions on autobiographical memory -LRB- AbM -RRB- in patients with Alzheimer 's disease -LRB- AD -RRB- , characteristically triggering atrophy in the hippocampus and the amygdala , two crucial structures sustaining memory and emotional processing .

25852541|Additionally , we sought to determine the relationship of emotional AbM to amygdalar-hippocampal volumes .

25852541|Global scores and rates of emotional memories , but not the specificity scores , were correlated to right amygdalar and hippocampal volumes , indicating that atrophy in these structures has a central role in the deficit observed .

25847686|The role of the amygdala in emotion and social perception has been intensively investigated primarily through studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- .

25846623|A limbic brain area , the amygdala plays a key role in emotional responses and affective states and disorders such as learned fear , anxiety , and depression .

25846623|The amygdala has also emerged as an important brain center for the emotional-affective dimension of pain and for pain modulation .

25846623|Hyperactivity in the laterocapsular division of the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeLC , also termed the '' nociceptive amygdala '' -RRB- accounts for pain-related emotional responses and anxiety-like behavior .

25836993|Intrinsic FC analyses focused on amygdala-medial prefrontal circuitry , a key emotion regulatory pathway in the brain .

25836993|Overall , results suggest a model in which urban-dwelling trauma-exposed youth lack negative prefrontal to amygdala connectivity that may be critical for regulation of emotional responses .

25836045|Time-dependent effects of emotion have been attributed to an emotional consolidation process whereby the amygdala gradually facilitates the storage of emotional memories by other medial temporal lobe regions .

25836045|However , we propose that these effects can be better understood by an emotional binding account whereby the amygdala mediates the recollection of item-emotion bindings that are forgotten more slowly than item-context bindings supported by the hippocampus .

25835522|The posterior Superior Temporal Suclus -LRB- pSTS -RRB- represents a central hub in the complex cerebral network for person perception and emotion recognition as also suggested by its heavy connections with face - and body-specific cortical -LRB- e.g. , the fusiform face area , FFA and the extrastriate body area , EBA -RRB- and subcortical structures -LRB- e.g. , amygdala -RRB- .

25828849|This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive review of available imaging genetics studies , including reports on genetic variants that have most frequently been linked to MDD , such as the monoaminergic genes -LRB- serotonin transporter gene , monoamine oxidase A gene , tryptophan hydroxylase-2 gene , serotonin receptor 1A gene and catechol-O-methyl transferase gene -RRB- , with regard to key structures involved in emotion processing , such as the hippocampus , amygdala , anterior cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex .

25828684|A direct or indirect pathway activated during positive emotion from the central amygdala to the SLD PS-on neurons would induce such activation .

25825732|The amygdala plays an integral role in human social cognition and behavior , with clear links to emotion recognition , trust judgments , anthropomorphization , and psychiatric disorders ranging from social phobia to autism .

25824424|We examined whether amygdala activation probed by emotion stimuli is a general or differential predictor of response to three commonly prescribed antidepressants , using functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- .

25824424|We quantified the blood oxygen level-dependent signal of the amygdala during subliminal and supraliminal viewing of facial expressions of emotion .

25820768|Given the importance of the amygdala in the regulation of emotion and their relevance for the pathophysiology of depression , potential alterations in diurnal patterns of basolateral amygdala gene expression in Cry2 -LRB- - / - -RRB- mice were investigated focusing on core clock genes and neurotrophic factor systems implicated in the pathophysiology of depression .

25820768|Collectively , these results indicate that Cry2 exerts a critical role in the control of depression-related emotional states and modulates the chronobiological gene expression profile in the mouse amygdala .

25809400|Across groups , emotional vs neutral scenes elicited activation in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex , inferior frontal gyrus/anterior insula and amygdala .

25802460|Pain is characterized as a complex experience , dependent not only on the regulation of nociceptive sensory systems , but also on the activation of mechanisms that control emotional processes in limbic brain areas such as the amygdala and the hippocampus .

25801500|NCAN is implicated in neuronal plasticity and expressed in subcortical brain areas , such as the amygdala and hippocampus , which are critically involved in dysfunctional emotion processing and regulation across diagnostic boundaries .

25797834|We found that novelty processing involved functional areas for procedural memory -LRB- caudate -RRB- , mental rewarding -LRB- substantia nigra , SN -RRB- , and visual-spatial processing , whereas appropriateness processing was mediated by areas for declarative memory -LRB- hippocampus -RRB- , emotional arousal -LRB- amygdala -RRB- , and orthography recognition .

25791360|Furthermore , in the traumatized non-PTSD group , the activation of the dorso-medial prefrontal cortex and bilateral amygdala was lower during the observation of the reinforced -LRB- CS -LRB- + -RRB- -RRB- versus non-reinforced pictures -LRB- CS -LRB- - -RRB- -RRB- in response to emotionally negative stimuli .

25790021|Among patients with PTSD , the PTSD+DS group exhibited greater amygdala functional connectivity to prefrontal regions involved in emotion regulation -LRB- bilateral BLA and left CMA to the middle frontal gyrus and bilateral CMA to the medial frontal gyrus -RRB- as compared with the PTSD-DS group .

25787948|Recent evidence suggests that the anxiolytic effects of neurosteroids are mediated by the amygdala , a key structure for emotional and cognitive behaviors .

25785510|To examine the categorical and dimensional relationships of PS symptoms to prefrontal hypoactivation during working memory and to amygdala hyperactivation during threat emotion processing .

25785510|Two functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigms were used : a fractal n-back working memory task probing executive system function and an emotion identification task probing amygdala responses to threatening faces .

25785510|During emotion identification , PS demonstrated elevated responses to threatening facial expressions in amygdala , as well as left fusiform cortex and right middle frontal gyrus -LRB- cluster-corrected P < .05 -RRB- .

25777814|However , we found a significant negative correlation between emotional blunting and neural activation in the left amygdala during processing of positive affect .

25776217|We revealed that amygdala reactivity was modulated by an interaction between the factors of stress , neuroticism , and the emotional valence of the facial stimuli .

25771686|During the presence of emotional distracters , subjects with bipolar I disorder showed slowed reaction times to targets , and increased blood oxygenation level-dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- responses in the amygdala , accumbens , and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , but not increased inverse functional connectivity between these prefrontal and subcortical areas , and altered white matter microstructure organization in the right uncinate fasciculus .

25770355|Hippocampal volume loss had twice the effect on Social-Emotional Dysfunction as amygdala loss , consistent with a hippocampal role in attachment and social emotions .

25765593|During the emotion task , happy faces elicited activation in the ventral striatum , nucleus accumbens and anterior amygdala in neurotypical , but not HFA , participants .

25762915|Results show that : -LRB- 1 -RRB- ReHo of the left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- dACC -RRB- was significantly increased in the LG -LRB- in comparison to the ELG and the SG -RRB- ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- ReHo of the left dACC was positively correlated with length of time in love in the LG , and negatively correlated with the lovelorn duration since breakup in the ELG ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- FC within the reward , motivation , and emotion regulation network -LRB- dACC , insula , caudate , amygdala , and nucleus accumbens -RRB- as well as FC in the social cognition network -LSB- temporo-parietal junction -LRB- TPJ -RRB- , posterior cingulate cortex -LRB- PCC -RRB- , medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- MPFC -RRB- , inferior parietal , precuneus , and temporal lobe -RSB- was significantly increased in the LG -LRB- in comparison to the ELG and SG -RRB- ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- in most regions within both networks FC was positively correlated with the duration of love in the LG but negatively correlated with the lovelorn duration of time since breakup in the ELG .

25761002|We found that implied emotion in sentences , relative to neutral sentences , led to activation in some emotion-related areas , including the medial prefrontal cortex , the amygdala , and the insula , as well as certain language-related areas , including the inferior frontal gyrus , which has been implicated in combinatorial processing .

25748136|The hypothalamus plays a role in such behaviors , but prevailing textbook views depict it as an effector of upstream emotion centers , such as the amygdala , rather than as an emotion center itself .

25744868|Relative to HC , HIV + patients demonstrated emotion recognition impairments for fearful expressions , reduced anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- volumes , and increased amygdala volumes .

25740536|Juvenile obesity enhances emotional memory and amygdala plasticity through glucocorticoids . .

25740536|Adolescence is a decisive period for maturation of the amygdala and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal -LRB- HPA -RRB- stress axis , both required for lifelong cognitive and emotional processing .

25740536|Herein , we therefore evaluate in rats whether juvenile high-fat diet -LRB- HFD -RRB- - induced obesity alters amygdala-dependent emotional memory and whether it depends on HPA axis deregulation .

25740536|Juvenile HFD also enhances emotion-induced neuronal activation of the basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , which correlates with protracted plasma corticosterone release .

25735989|Thus the excitatory input from the amygdala to the LC , activated by an emotional stimulus , would lead to the ` switching off ' of LC activity via the supersensitive auto-inhibition mechanism .

25713527|The ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- VLPFC -RRB- and amygdala have critical roles in the generation and regulation of unpleasant emotions , and in this study the dynamic neural basis of unpleasant emotion processing was elucidated by using paired-samples permutation t-tests to identify the timing of emotional discrimination in various brain regions .

25713527|Results show that emotional discrimination in the right amygdala precedes that in the left amygdala and that emotional discrimination in both those regions precedes that in the right anterior VLPFC .

25713527|They support the hypotheses that the right amygdala is part of a rapid emotional stimulus detection system and the left amygdala is specialized for sustained stimulus evaluation and that the right anterior VLPFC is implicated in the integration of viscerosensory information with affective signals between the bilateral anterior VLPFCs and the bilateral amygdalae .

25703807|We also investigated the role of the amygdala , the key region for social interaction and emotion recognition .

25703807|This may indicate that in FR subjects the amygdala have to take a greater role in emotion recognition and social functioning .

25703807|This inference was supported by our discovery of statistically significant correlations between the amygdala BOLD response and emotion recognition in the FR group but not in controls .

25703646|Sad mood induction has an opposite effect on amygdala response to emotional stimuli in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder and healthy controls . .

25703646|The sad and normal mood exerted opposite effects on the amygdala response to emotional faces in patients compared with controls -LRB- F1 ,38 = 5.85 , p = 0.020 -RRB- .

25701910|It is hardly surprising that mood disorders are associated with structural and functional changes of neural circuits linking brain areas specialized in emotional processing such as the prefrontal cortex , basal ganglia , and amygdala .

25701125|The amygdala is a significant contributor to the expression of emotion and the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is a major target for the effects of stress on emotion .

25700742|The role of the amygdala during emotional processing in Huntington 's disease : from pre-manifest to late stage disease . .

25697832|Sleep deprivation also increases emotional reactivity ; results which are most apparent with neuro-imaging studies investigating amygdala activity and its prefrontal regulation .

25694806|Botulinum toxin-induced facial muscle paralysis affects amygdala responses to the perception of emotional expressions : preliminary findings from an A-B-A design . .

25694806|However , it remains to be seen whether facial muscle paralysis affects brain activity , especially the amygdala , which is known to be responsive to the perception of emotion in others .

25689569|Our results showed that at 6 months of age , the amygdala is functionally connected to widespread brain regions , forming the emotional regulation , sensory and perceptual , and emotional memory networks .

25688096|The amygdala is a highly interconnected region of the brain that is critically important to emotional processing and affective networks .

25688096|Previous studies have shown that the response of the amygdala to emotionally arousing stimuli can be modulated by sex hormones .

25688096|Because oral contraceptive pills dramatically lower circulating sex hormone levels with potent analogs of those hormones , we performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment to measure amygdala reactivity in response to emotional stimuli in women using oral contraceptives , and compared their amygdala reactivity with that of naturally cycling women .

25688096|Here , we show that women who use oral contraceptive pills have significantly decreased bilateral amygdala reactivity in response to negatively valenced , emotionally arousing stimuli compared with naturally cycling women .

25688096|We suggest that by modulating amygdala reactivity , oral contraceptive pills may influence behaviors that have previously been shown to be amygdala dependent-in particular , emotional memory .

25675509|Specifically , high levels of OXTR methylation were associated with greater amounts of activity in regions associated with face and emotion processing including amygdala , fusiform , and insula .

25675509|Importantly , we found that these higher levels of OXTR methylation were also associated with decreased functional coupling of amygdala with regions involved in affect appraisal and emotion regulation .

25671315|The increased activation in the amygdala -LRB- part of the salience and emotion processing network -RRB- appears to be associated with feelings of surprise and the reading pleasure , which supra-natural events , full of novelty and unexpectedness , brought about .

25669753|The contextual retrieval of emotional memory involves hippocampal projections to the medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala ; however the relative contribution of these projections is unclear .

25666311|Drug conditions were compared by performing a region of interest -LRB- ROI -RRB- analysis of the bilateral amygdala on responses to the emotion recognition test .

25666311|It was found that nasal spray decreased amygdala activity for fearful emotion and increased activity for happy faces .

25666311|Intranasal oxytocin attenuated amygdala activity for emotional faces in patients with schizophrenia , whereas intranasal oxytocin significantly increased amygdala activity in healthy controls .

25653526|These circuits involve bottom-up activity from the amygdala , indicating the presence of potentially threatening stimuli , and top-down control mechanisms originating in the prefrontal cortex , signaling the emotional salience of stimuli .

25649277|The present studies addressed this question by examining the neuroanatomical , behavioral , and pharmacological mechanisms mediating the anorexia produced by PACAP in the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , a limbic structure implicated in the emotional components of ingestive behavior .

25646995|The lateral amygdala nucleus -LRB- La -RRB- is known as a gateway for emotional learning that interfaces sensory inputs from the cortex and the thalamus .

25642179|Cognitively demanding conditions were associated with greater activation of right medial frontal and insula regions while bilateral amygdala was more significantly altered during emotion -LRB- cognitively undemanding -RRB- conditions ; consistent with task demands .

25642179|Overlap was present in left amygdala and right subcallosal cingulate between emotion and resting meta-analyses , with no significant divergence .

25641358|Significant hemodynamic differences were detected in the posterior superior temporal sulcus , amygdala , insula , ventral striatum , and prefrontal cortex when individuals with high psychopathy viewed negative versus positive scenarios moral scenarios and when they evaluated the emotional responses of the protagonists .

25641263|However , although the importance of this amygdalar expression in emotion-related behavior and the physiopathology of neuropsychiatric disorders has been accepted , a detailed study of the Chrna2 expression pattern during development has been lacking .

25641263|This finding could help us to better understand the role of Chrna2 in the differentiation and functional maturation of amygdalar neurons involved in cholinergic-regulated emotional behavior .

25640931|The authors first highlight the most consistent findings from neuroimaging studies using different techniques in depression , including structural and functional abnormalities in two parallel neural circuits : serotonergically modulated implicit emotion regulation circuitry , centered on the amygdala and different regions in the medial prefrontal cortex ; and dopaminergically modulated reward neural circuitry , centered on the ventral striatum and medial prefrontal cortex .

25638277|In this review , we argue that both behavioral and neurophysiological evidence supports a role of REM sleep for amygdala-related memory processing : the amygdala-hippocampus-medial prefrontal cortex network involved in emotional processing , fear memory and valence consolidation shows strongest activity during REM sleep , in contrast to the hippocampus-medial prefrontal cortex only network which is more active during non-REM sleep .

25636177|We include our work implicating PACAP signaling within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis in mediating the consequences of stressor exposure and relatedly , describe more recent studies suggesting that PACAP in the central nucleus of the amygdala may impact the emotional aspects of chronic pain states .

25630572|Parallel human imaging findings relative to ELS also reveal enhanced amygdala reactivity and disrupted connectivity but the influence of ELS on amygdala subregion connectivity and modulation of emotion is unclear .

25630572|Here we employed cytoarchitectonic probability maps of amygdala subregions and Granger causality methods to evaluate task-based intra-amygdaloid and extra-amygdaloid connectivity with the network underlying implicit regulation of emotion in response to unconditioned auditory threat in healthy controls with ELS -LRB- N = 20 -RRB- and without a history of ELS -LRB- N = 14 -RRB- .

25630572|These findings are consistent with compensatory mechanisms of emotion regulation following ELS among resilient persons originating both within the amygdala complex as well as subsequent extra-amygdaloid communication .

25629899|Asymmetric engagement of amygdala and its gamma connectivity in early emotional face processing . .

25629899|The amygdala has been regarded as a key substrate for emotion processing .

25629899|However , the engagement of the left and right amygdala during the early perceptual processing of different emotional faces remains unclear .

25629899|We investigated the temporal profiles of oscillatory gamma activity in the amygdala and effective connectivity of the amygdala with the thalamus and cortical areas during implicit emotion-perceptual tasks using event-related magnetoencephalography -LRB- MEG -RRB- .

25629899|We found that within 100 ms after stimulus onset the right amygdala habituated to emotional faces rapidly -LRB- with duration around 20-30 ms -RRB- , whereas activity in the left amygdala -LRB- with duration around 50-60 ms -RRB- sustained longer than that in the right .

25629899|Our data suggest that the right amygdala could be linked to autonomic arousal generated by facial emotions and the left amygdala might be involved in decoding or evaluating expressive faces in the early perceptual emotion processing .

25629899|The results of effective connectivity provide evidence that only negative emotional processing engages both cortical and subcortical pathways connected to the right amygdala , representing its evolutional significance -LRB- survival -RRB- .

25629899|These findings demonstrate the asymmetric engagement of bilateral amygdala in emotional face processing as well as the capability of MEG for assessing thalamo-cortico-limbic circuitry .

25623036|Alcohol exposure and withdrawal induce changes in crucial epigenetic processes in the emotional brain circuitry -LRB- amygdala -RRB- that may be relevant to the negative affective state defined as the '' dark side '' of addiction .

25620180|Findings were consistent with other neuroimaging studies ; the active areas -LRB- i.e. amygdala , insula , inferior and medial frontal gyrus -RRB- have consistently been associated with emotional experiences .

25618591|It has been hypothesized that sex hormones such as testosterone play an important role in risk taking by influencing the development of brain networks involved in emotion and motivation , particularly the amygdala and its functional connections .

25618212|However , instructions to increase positive and negative emotional responses resulted in less increase in nucleus accumbens and amygdala activations -LRB- respectively -RRB- in the ASD group , and both regulation instructions resulted in less change in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation in the ASD group .

25610763|Recent neuroimaging work suggests that increased amygdala responses to emotional stimuli and dysfunction within regions mediating top down attentional control -LRB- dorsomedial frontal , lateral frontal and parietal cortices -RRB- may be associated with the emergence of anxiety disorders , including posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- .

25610763|This report examines amygdala responsiveness to emotional stimuli and the recruitment of top down attention systems as a function of task demands in a population of U.S. military service members who had recently returned from combat deployment in Afghanistan/Iraq .

25610763|Greater PTSD symptom severity scores were associated with increased amygdala activation to emotional , particularly positive , stimuli relative to neutral stimuli .

25610763|In addition , greater PTSD symptom severity scores were associated with : -LRB- i -RRB- increased activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal , lateral frontal , inferior parietal cortices and dorsomedial frontal cortex/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- dmFC/dACC -RRB- in response to emotional relative to neutral stimuli ; and -LRB- ii -RRB- increased functional connectivity during emotional trials , particularly positive trials , relative to neutral trials between the right amygdala and dmFC/dACC , left caudate/anterior insula cortex , right lentiform nucleus/caudate , bilateral inferior parietal cortex and left middle temporal cortex .

25610763|First , these data indicate increased emotional responsiveness by : -LRB- i -RRB- the positive relationship between PTSD symptom severity and amygdala responsiveness to emotional relative to neutral stimuli ; -LRB- ii -RRB- greater BOLD response as a function of PTSD symptom severity in regions implicated in emotion -LRB- striatum -RRB- and representation -LRB- occipital and temporal cortices -RRB- during emotional relative to neutral conditions ; and -LRB- iii -RRB- increased connectivity between the amygdala and regions implicated in emotion -LRB- insula/caudate -RRB- and representation -LRB- middle temporal cortex -RRB- as a function of PTSD symptom severity during emotional relative to neutral trials .

25610763|Second , these data indicate a greater need for the recruitment of regions implicated in top down attention as indicated by -LRB- i -RRB- greater BOLD response in superior/middle frontal gyrus as a function of PTSD symptom severity in task relative to view conditions ; -LRB- ii -RRB- greater BOLD response in dmFC/dACC , lateral frontal and inferior parietal cortices as a function of PTSD symptom severity in emotional relative to neutral conditions and -LRB- iii -RRB- greater functional connectivity between the amygdala and inferior parietal cortex as a function of PTSD symptom severity during emotional relative to neutral conditions .

25605886|Asymmetrical effects of unilateral right or left amygdala damage on auditory cortical processing of vocal emotions . .

25605886|In two functional MRI experiments , patients with unilateral amygdala resection either listened to voices and nonvocal sounds or heard binaural vocalizations with attention directed toward or away from emotional information on one side .

25605886|In experiment 2 , emotional voices evoked increased activity in both the auditory cortex and the intact amygdala for right-damaged patients , whereas no such effects were found for left-damaged amygdala patients .

25605886|Thus , unilateral amygdala damage leads to globally reduced ipsilesional cortical voice processing , but only left amygdala lesions are sufficient to suppress the enhanced auditory cortical processing of vocal emotions .

25603413|The neural mechanisms include impaired control of amygdala reactivity to emotional stimuli and dysfunctional connectivity of the amygdala to regulatory control regions in the OFC .

25595976|We indicated that the GM volume changes of the amygdala may be highly related to emotional factors .

25592533|The amygdala has long been associated with emotion and motivation , playing an essential part in processing both fearful and rewarding environmental stimuli .

25592435|Indeed , magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- studies investigating structural and functional connectivity between different areas of the brain suggest an altered prefrontal-limbic coupling leading to disrupted emotional processing in BD , including uncinate fasciculus , amygdala , parahippocampal cortex , cingulate cortex as well corpus callosum .

25583614|HPA axis genetic variation , pubertal status , and sex interact to predict amygdala and hippocampus responses to negative emotional faces in school-age children . .

25583614|Understanding how individual differences in these factors predict differences in emotional responsivity may be important for understanding both normative emotional development and for understanding the mechanisms underlying internalizing disorders , like anxiety and depression , that have often been related to increased amygdala and hippocampus responses to negatively valenced emotional stimuli .

25583614|Experience of more stressful and traumatic life events predicted greater left amygdala responses to negative emotional stimuli .

25581710|Because mPFC and amygdala have dense reciprocal connections and projections between them continue to develop until adolescence , early-life stress may impair the function of this circuit and cause emotional dysregulation .

25578794|Modulation of emotional processing was apparent as a significant expression-by-stimulation interaction within left amygdala , where responses during appraisal of fearful faces were selectively reduced by carotid stimulation .

25578794|Moreover , activity reductions within insula , amygdala , and hippocampus correlated with the degree of stimulation-evoked change in the explicit emotional ratings of fearful faces .

25577137|Preserved emotional awareness of pain in a patient with extensive bilateral damage to the insula , anterior cingulate , and amygdala . .

25576174|The right central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- is critical for the lateral spinal ascending pain pathway , regulates descending pain pathways and is key in the emotional-affective components of pain .

25566024|Viewing of faces paired with a negative sentence was associated with increased early viewing of the eye region and increased neural activity between 600 and 1200 ms in emotion processing regions such as the cingulate , medial prefrontal cortex , and amygdala , as well as posterior regions such as the precuneus and occipital cortex .

25564288|We found that labels rated high on emotional reaction were better remembered , associated with reduction in the urge to smoke , and produced greater brain response in the amygdala , hippocampi , inferior frontal gyri and the insulae .

25564288|Recognition memory and craving are , respectively , correlates of effectiveness of addiction-related public health communications and interventions , and amygdala activation facilitates the encoding of emotional memories .

25563230|It has also been suggested that DA plays an important role in emotional processing , and that altered DA-ergic intervention may modulate amygdala function .

25556211|This effect appears to have been exacerbated or offset by co-occurring activity in other top-down control regions -LRB- parietal -RRB- and emotion processing regions -LRB- orbitofrontal cortex , amygdala and nucleus accumbens -RRB- as a function of the valence of state affect -LRB- positive or negative -RRB- and trait affect -LRB- trait NA or trait PA -RRB- .

25547713|Glucocorticoid hormones are known to act synergistically with other stress-activated neuromodulatory systems , such as norepinephrine and corticotropin-releasing factor -LRB- CRF -RRB- , within the basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- to induce optimal strengthening of the consolidation of long-term memory of emotionally arousing experiences .

25545818|Animal models of depression indicate enhanced plasticity in a ventral emotional network , comprising the amygdala .

25545818|The finding of enhanced fear extinction learning in major depressive disorder is consistent with the concept that the disorder is characterized by enhanced synaptic plasticity in the amygdala and the ventral emotional network .

25540682|Aberrant amygdala-prefrontal interactions at rest and during emotion processing are implicated in the pathophysiology of generalized social anxiety disorder -LRB- gSAD -RRB- , a common disorder characterized by fears of potential scrutiny .

25540682|To date , predictors of success in CBT for gSAD include reduced amygdala reactivity and increased activity in prefrontal regulatory regions -LRB- e.g. , anterior cingulate cortex , '' ACC '' -RRB- during emotion processing .

25536499|As hypothesized , the OFC , in the context of the emotional face discrimination task , exhibited a down-regulatory effect on amygdala activation .

25530842|This extends upon previous work suggesting alterations in amygdala circuits underlying fear learning , emotion regulation , and the processing of interoceptive states .

25530477|Moreover , intrahippocampal TSA infusion produced concomitant decreases -LRB- in adults -RRB- or increases -LRB- in older mice -RRB- of acetylated histone levels in the ventral hippocampus -LRB- vCA1 and vCA3 -RRB- and the lateral amygdala , two structures critically involved in stress and emotional responses .

25511718|In this presentation , we present the BOOSTER results on the effects of a single oxytocin administration on amygdala reactivity in response to emotional faces in PTSD patients versus traumatized controls .

25511718|We found significantly decreased bilateral amygdala reactivity towards emotional faces in PTSD patients compared to traumatized controls .

25510947|Sad mood induction has an opposite effect on amygdala response to emotional stimuli in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder and healthy controls . .

25510947|The sad and normal mood exerted opposite effects on the amygdala response to emotional faces in patients compared with controls -LRB- F1 ,38 = 5.85 , p = 0.020 -RRB- .

25505380|However , emotion-related changes are more consistently found , and are better associated with progesterone than with estradiol such that high progesterone levels are associated with increased amygdala reactivity and increased emotional memory .

25496511|We compared the pattern of responses in the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex when trials were sorted by pleasantness judgments relative to when they were sorted by the acoustic properties known to influence emotional reactions to musical chords .

25496511|The finding that differentiations in the amygdala based on pleasantness ratings had a longer latency suggests that in this structure , mediation of emotional judgment follows accumulation of sensory information .

25490197|Several pathways have been identified for enhancing neural responses of cortical visual areas to stimuli with intrinsic emotional value -LRB- e.g. , facial expressions , social scenes , and others -RRB- , including projections from the amygdala and ascending modulatory neurotransmitter systems from the brainstem .

25483027|The medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- is known to be significantly involved in emotional adjustment , particularly introspection , inhibition of the amygdala and emotional memory .

25465029|Temporal lobe epilepsy and emotion recognition without amygdala : a case study of Urbach-Wiethe disease and review of the literature . .

25465029|We describe the epilepsy features and emotion recognition abilities -LRB- recognition of basic facial emotions and recognition of emotional prosody -RRB- in a patient with Urbach-Wiethe disease with bilateral amygdala calcifications .

25465029|Our findings suggest that in Urbach-Wiethe disease , the circumscribed damage of both amygdalae results in a selective dysfunction of fearful face processing , in contrast to bilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy patients who present with a widespread and multimodal impairment in the judgement of emotional stimuli .

25463465|Furthermore , emotional intelligence partially mediated the effects of the right pSTG and thalamus on cognitive well-being , as well as the effect of the right amygdala on affective well-being .

25461265|fMRI feedback enhances emotion regulation as evidenced by a reduced amygdala response . .

25461265|Neurophysiological models have established the lateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- LPFC -RRB- as a key structure in the regulation of emotion processing through modulations of emotion-eliciting structures such as the amygdala .

25458113|Because neural activity in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is critical for the acquisition of conditioned defeat and BLA 5-HT2a receptors can modulate anxiety but have a limited effect on emotional memories , we investigated whether 5-HT2a receptor modulation alters defeat-induced anxiety but not defeat-related memories .

25456521|Relationship between amygdala volume and emotion recognition in adolescents at ultra-high risk for psychosis . .

25456521|The current study investigated whether amygdala volumes were related to emotion-recognition impairments in UHR individuals , and whether volumes differed by sex .

25456521|Secondary aims were to assess whether -LRB- a -RRB- emotion-recognition performance was associated with interhemispheric amygdala volume asymmetry and -LRB- b -RRB- amgydala volume and volume asymmetry acted as a mediator between emotion-recognition and outcome measures .

25456521|The amygdala was manually delineated from magnetic resonance images for 39 UHR individuals who had also completed facial and prosody emotion-recognition tasks .

25456521|Findings suggest a complex relationship between emotion recognition , the structure of the amygdala and illness outcome , where recognition of sadness appears to be the precipitator of this relationship in UHR females .

25447473|The present findings suggest that emotional disorder manifested in the forms of fear conditioning is accompanied with BK channel suppression in the amygdala , the brain structure critical to this emotional disorder .

25446442|Angiotensin - -LRB- 1-7 -RRB- in the basolateral amygdala attenuates the cardiovascular response evoked by acute emotional stress . .

25446442|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- plays a critical role in mediating physiological responses to emotional stress .

25439326|Concurrent and lasting effects of emotion regulation on amygdala response in adolescence and young adulthood . .

25439326|This study used functional MRI -LRB- fMRI -RRB- to examine a novel aspect of emotion regulation in adolescent development : whether age predicts differences in both the concurrent and lasting effects of emotion regulation on amygdala response .

25439326|During re-presentation , older individuals continued to show lasting reductions in the amygdala response to aversive stimuli they had previously reappraised , an effect mediated by rostrolateral PFC. These data suggest that one source of heightened emotionality in adolescence is a diminished ability to cognitively down-regulate aversive reactions .

25438046|These results suggest that low PS may involve an imbalance in processing distinct emotional inputs , with greater reactivity to aversive information in regions involved in avoidance behaviour -LRB- amygdala , OFC -RRB- and dampened response to positive and neutral stimuli across circuits subserving motivated behaviour -LRB- striatum , hippocampus , amygdala -RRB- .

25436666|These results provide a cellular basis in the amygdala for the alteration of emotional states from normal to pathological fear .

25436222|Basic research has found that high levels of catecholamine release during stress rapidly impair the top-down cognitive functions of the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- , while strengthening the emotional and habitual responses of the amygdala and basal ganglia .

25433424|Decreased amygdala-insula resting state connectivity in behaviorally and emotionally dysregulated youth . .

25433424|Resting state connectivity between amygdala and posterior insula decreased with increasing severity of behavioral and emotional dysregulation and depression ; this suggests an intrinsic functional uncoupling of key neural regions supporting emotion processing and regulation .

25432161|Convergent neuroimaging findings implicate alterations in brain circuits mediating emotional expression , regulation and awareness -LRB- anterior cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortices , insula , amygdala , vermis -RRB- , cognitive control and motor inhibition -LRB- dorsal anterior cingulate , dorsolateral prefrontal , inferior frontal cortices -RRB- , self-referential processing and perceptual awareness -LRB- posterior parietal cortex , temporoparietal junction -RRB- , and motor planning and coordination -LRB- supplementary motor area , cerebellum -RRB- .

25425031|Connectivity between the amygdala and cortical regions is thought to be important for emotion regulation , a function that is compromised in SAD .

25425031|Functional connectivity between cortical emotion regulation regions and the amygdala was investigated .

25425031|Compared to controls , SAD participants showed reduced functional integration between cortical emotion regulation regions and the amygdala during the public speech anticipation .

25424551|Early adverse caregiving experiences have been associated with structural alterations in the amygdala and hippocampus , which parallel findings of cortical regions altered in adults with behavior problems related to emotion regulation .

25424367|The rat posterodorsal medial amygdala -LRB- MePD -RRB- links emotionally charged sensory stimuli to social behavior , and is part of the supramedullary control of the cardiovascular system .

25422964|Key brain measures included amygdala volume and amygdala activation to an emotion face-viewing task .

25422963|The goal of the present study was to extend our knowledge of the dynamics of amygdala dysfunction by examining whether changes in amygdala activation and connectivity over scanning differ in pediatric anxiety disorder patients relative to typically developing controls during an emotion processing task .

25422962|Specifically , we found that smaller hippocampus volumes and greater responses to sad faces in emotion reactivity regions predict increased depressive symptoms at the time of scan , whereas larger amygdala volumes , smaller insula volumes , and greater responses in emotion reactivity regions predict decreased emotion regulation skills .

25413183|Results showed that trauma-exposed youth failed to dampen dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity and engage amygdala-pregenual cingulate inhibitory circuitry during the regulation of emotional conflict , and were less able to regulate emotional conflict .

25413183|Aberrant amygdala response to emotional conflict was related to diminished reward sensitivity that is emerging as a critical stress-susceptibility trait that may contribute to the emergence of mental illness during adolescence .

25401328|Many studies have reported that cognitive control of emotion induces increases in neural activity of the control system , including the prefrontal cortex and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex , and increases or decreases -LRB- depending upon the regulation goal -RRB- in neural activity of the appraisal system , including the amygdala and the insula .

25396729|Although there is widespread evidence for amygdala hypersensitivity to emotional faces in SP , verbal material has rarely been used in imaging studies , in particular with an eye on disorder-specificity .

25394948|The increased amygdala activity points to facilitated appetitive conditioning in Val/Val-allele carriers while the amygdala/prefrontal connectivity results could be regarded as a marker for altered emotion regulation during conditioning , which potentially impacts appetitive learning sensitivity .

25389397|Antagonistic interactions between brain regions implicated in emotion processing , e.g. , amygdala , and brain regions involved in cognitive control , e.g. , dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- dlPFC , dmPFC -RRB- , may play an important role in coping with emotional distraction .

25389397|We previously reported prolonged reaction times associated with amygdala hyperreactivity during emotional distraction in interpersonally traumatized borderline personality disorder -LRB- BPD -RRB- patients compared to healthy controls -LRB- HC -RRB- : Participants performed a working memory task , while neutral versus negative distractors -LRB- interpersonal scenes from the International Affective Picture System -RRB- were presented .

25389397|During emotional distraction , reduced amygdala connectivity with clusters in the left dorsolateral and ventrolateral PFC was observed in the whole group .

25389397|Reaction times positively predicted amygdala connectivity with right dmPFC and -LRB- para -RRB- hippocampus , while dissociation positively predicted amygdala connectivity with right ACC during emotional distraction in patients .

25386133|The psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed that participants with HE exhibited stronger right amygdala-right insula connectivity during perception of emotional and neutral facial expressions .

25382193|They also displayed stronger negative coupling between amygdala and pregenual ACC , dmPFC and temporo-parietal regions during emotional face processing .

25381464|The basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- assigns emotional valence to sensory stimuli , and many amygdala-dependent behaviors undergo marked development during postnatal life .

25377694|Accumulating evidence indicates that emotional empathy depends on coordinated functions of orbitofrontal cortex , anterior insula , anterior cingulate , temporal pole , and amygdala , but few studies have investigated effects of lesions to white matter tracts that connect these structures .

25372882|Recent neuroimaging studies have identified a potentially critical role of the amygdala in disrupted emotion neurocircuitry in individuals after total sleep deprivation -LRB- TSD -RRB- .

25365801|Within regions that showed connectivity with the amygdala as a function of maltreatment , we also evaluated whether amygdala connectivity was associated positively with negative affect and negatively with healthy emotional processing .

25365801|Furthermore , connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampus was positively related to measures of depression , trait anxiety , and emotion dysregulation , and negatively related to self-compassion and dispositional mindfulness .

25339749|Whereas cooperative communication between the hippocampus -LRB- HP -RRB- and prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- is critical for cognitive functions , an antagonistic relationship may exist between the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and PFC during emotional processing .

25331606|Activity in the amygdala and hippocampus during emotional face-matching increased with the level of CLS in male MAOA-L , while decreasing in male MAOA-H , with the reverse pattern present in females .

25329241|These results demonstrate lasting brain changes induced by amygdala rtfMRI-nf training and suggest the importance of reinforcement learning in rehabilitating emotion regulation in depression .

25326039|Using functional magnetic resonance imaging , the present study examined the effects of trait and primed attachment security on amygdala reactivity to threatening stimuli in an emotional faces and a linguistic dot-probe task in 42 healthy participants .

25326039|Furthermore , participants who received attachment-security priming showed attenuated amygdala activation in both the emotional faces and dot-probe tasks .

25325493|We evaluated in a hypothesis-driven design whether patients with ID present altered amygdale responses to emotional stimuli related and unrelated to the experience of insomnia and , because of chronic hyperarousal , less habituation of amygdala responses .

25322361|Pleiotropic locus for emotion recognition and amygdala volume identified using univariate and bivariate linkage . .

25322361|The role of the amygdala in emotion recognition is well established , and amygdala volume and emotion recognition performance have each been shown separately to be highly heritable traits , but the potential role of common genetic influences on both traits has not been explored .

25322361|The authors investigated the pleiotropic influences of amygdala volume and emotion recognition performance .

25322361|In a sample of randomly selected extended pedigrees -LRB- N = 858 -RRB- , the authors used a combination of univariate and bivariate linkage to investigate pleiotropy between amygdala volume and emotion recognition performance and followed up with association analysis .

25322361|The authors found a pleiotropic region for amygdala volume and emotion recognition performance on chromosome 4q26 -LRB- LOD score = 4.40 -RRB- .

25322361|This study extends our understanding of the shared etiology between the amygdala and emotion recognition by showing that the overlap between amygdala volume and emotion recognition performance is due at least in part to common genetic influences .

25319690|Dynamic modulation of amygdala-hippocampal connectivity by emotional arousal . .

25319690|These findings indicate that , during encoding , emotionally arousing information leads to a robust increase in effective connectivity from the amygdala to the hippocampus , regardless of its valence .

25312830|Considerable research indicates that long-term synaptic plasticity in the amygdala underlies the acquisition of emotional memories , including those learned during Pavlovian fear conditioning .

25309459|In many studies of the interaction between cognitive control and emotion , the orbitofrontal cortex/ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mOFC/vmPFC -RRB- has been associated with an inhibitory function on limbic areas activated by emotionally arousing stimuli , such as the amygdala .

25309400|Results of the emotion contrast revealed a negative correlation between PCL-R scores and activation in the right amygdala and rostral anterior cingulate .

25309390|The amygdala 's response to face and emotional information and potential category-specific modulation of temporal cortex as a function of emotion . .

25309390|The amygdala has been implicated in the processing of emotion and animacy information and to be responsive to novelty .

25309390|The amygdala showed responses to both emotional and animacy information , but no emotion by stimulus-type interaction ; i.e. , emotional face and object stimuli , when matched for arousal and valence , generate comparable amygdala activity relative to neutral face and object stimuli .

25309390|The current data suggest that the amygdala is responsive to animate and emotional stimuli .

25307567|The negative emotional state that drives such negative reinforcement is hypothesized to derive from decreases in reward neurotransmission in the ventral striatum , such as decreased dopamine and opioid peptide function in the nucleus accumbens -LRB- ventral striatum -RRB- , but also recruitment of brain stress systems , such as corticotropin-releasing factor -LRB- CRF -RRB- , in the extended amygdala .

25305809|Our results revealed a set of neural structures involved in the processing of emotion-laden literature , including emotion-related amygdala and a set of lateral prefrontal , anterior temporal , and temporo-parietal regions associated with discourse comprehension , high-level semantic integration , and Theory-of-Mind processing .

25305809|Yet , consistent with post-scan emotion ratings of text passages , factorial fMRI analyses revealed stronger hemodynamic responses to '' happy '' than to '' neutral '' in bilateral amygdala and the left precentral cortex that were restricted to L1 reading .

25304292|Subcortical regions of interest included the amygdala , accumbens area , hippocampus , caudate and putamen , chosen because their development seems potentially sensitive to an adverse intrauterine milieu and environmental experiences , and also due to their implication in cognitive and emotional processes .

25298173|In this study , we used a pre - and post-treatment -LRB- escitalopram -RRB- design to analyze the relative differences between neural activity in the right and left amygdalae during exposure to emotional stimuli in currently depressed patients .

25298173|We used amygdala region-of-interest analysis to evaluate the hemodynamic response during exposure to colored emotional pictures .

25298173|Amygdala responses to four types of emotional stimuli did not significantly change -LRB- p > 0.05 -RRB- with treatment in either the right or the left amygdala .

25298173|We found that the response between the right and left amygdala did not differ in terms of time series , although activity increased after pharmaceutical treatment for each emotion tested .

25291405|Subcortical brain structures of the limbic system , such as the amygdala , are thought to decode the emotional value of sensory information .

25291405|Recent neuroimaging studies , as well as lesion studies in patients , have shown that the amygdala is sensitive to emotions in voice and music .

25291405|This framework proposes that some vocal expressions might already receive a fast emotional evaluation via a subcortical pathway to the amygdala , whereas cortical pathways to the TLS are thought to be equally used for vocal and musical emotions .

25291405|While the amygdala might be specifically involved in a coarse decoding of the emotional value of voices and music , the hippocampus might process more complex vocal and musical emotions , and might have an important role especially for the decoding of musical emotions by providing memory-based and contextual associations .

25290865|Here we present findings from four different research laboratories , using three different species , which have converged on a similar finding : adversity accelerates the developmental trajectory of amygdala-prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- development and modifies emotional behaviors .

25290865|The convergence of these cross-species studies on early life adversity suggests that adversity targets the amygdala and PFC and has immediate impact on infant behavior with the caregiver , and emotional reactions to the world .

25284303|We assessed the within-subject reliability of amygdala habituation measures during a facial emotion matching paradigm in 25 healthy subjects .

25283782|These findings link the primate amygdala to eye movements involved in the exploration and selection of details in visual scenes that contain socially and emotionally salient features .

25279828|Regulation of emotional memory by hydrogen sulfide : role of GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor in the amygdala . .

25279828|However , the effect of H2 S on amygdala-mediated emotional memory has not been elucidated .

25279828|These results demonstrate that H2 S can regulate amygdala-dependent emotional memory by promoting the function of GluN2B-containing NMDARs in amygdala , suggesting that H2 S-associated signaling may hold potential as a new target for the treatment of emotional disorders .

25279828|In our study , the effect of hydrogen sulfide -LRB- H2 S -RRB- on amygdala-mediated emotional memory was investigated .

25279828|It was found that H2 S could enhance amygdala-dependent emotional memory and long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- in rats by selectively increasing the function of GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors in the amygdala .

25278851|Psychiatric conditions of emotion dysregulation are often characterized by difficulties in regulating the activity of limbic regions such as the amygdala .

25278851|Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- rt-fMRI -RRB- allows to feedback brain activation and opens the possibility to establish a neurofeedback -LRB- NF -RRB- training of amygdala activation , e.g. , for subjects suffering from emotion dysregulation .

25267070|Using a recombinant adeno-associated viral -LRB- rAAV -RRB- vector , we addressed this idea by testing effects on anxiolytic - and depression-like behaviours in adult mice after overexpression of NPY transgene in the amygdala and/or hippocampus , two brain regions implicated in emotional behaviours .

25264291|Abnormalities in the subcortical structures , such as amygdala , hypothalamus and basal ganglia , are associated with atypical emotional-face processing in individuals with ASD .

25263286|After adjusting for estimated intracranial volume , significant phenotypic -LRB- r -LRB- p -RRB- -RRB- and genetic -LRB- r -LRB- g -RRB- -RRB- correlations were observed between left amygdala volume and positive emotionality -LRB- r -LRB- p -RRB- = .16 , p < .01 ; r -LRB- g -RRB- = .23 , p < .05 , respectively -RRB- .

25261341|The amygdala contributes to production of the emotional dimension of pain .

25253281|We failed to find an association of 5-HTTLPR variation with amygdala activation during a widely used emotional-face-matching paradigm .

25227744|In Alzheimer 's disease , however , emotion processing deficits were associated with atrophy in a different set of brain regions , including the right cingulate and the bilateral insulae , as well as the hippocampi , right amygdala and nucleus accumbens bilaterally .

25220389|Positive affect scores correlated with the betweenness values of the right orbital frontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- and the right putamen in the positive emotional network ; negative affect scores correlated with the betweenness values of the left OFC and the left amygdala in the negative emotional network .

25218953|To further characterize the impairment of people with ASD in social attention , and to explore the possible role of the amygdala , we employed a series of visual search tasks with both social -LRB- faces and people with different postures , emotions , ages , and genders -RRB- and non-social stimuli -LRB- e.g. , electronics , food , and utensils -RRB- .

25217299|Its 2 principle components are the hippocampus -LRB- involved in memory as part of the Papez circuit -RRB- and the amygdala -LRB- involved in emotional responses , memories and drives -RRB- .

25208824|While the rationale for studying DBS for PTSD is ethically and scientifically justified , the importance of the amygdaloid complex and its connections for a myriad of emotional , perceptual , behavioral , and vegetative functions requires a complex trial design in terms of outcome measures .

25208742|Furthermore , interactions observed between pFC and both amygdala and nucleus accumbens are remarkably similar to neural mechanisms of emotion regulation through reappraisal in humans .

25204093|Currently , popular is the view that takes into consideration the integrating role of the insula and subcortical structures -LRB- such as hippocampus , amygdala , thalamus -RRB- in the regulation of cognitive and emotional processes in people suffering from AN .

25200984|We propose that the connectivity between the emotional centers of the brain -- the prefontal cortex and the amygdala -- is in part dependent on the homeostatic sleep system such that connectivity between these brain networks is higher when rested and lower when sleep deprived .

25176168|Separate studies have implicated the cholecystokinin -LRB- CCK -RRB- and endocannabinoid systems in fear ; however , there is a high degree of anatomical colocalization between the cannabinoid 1 receptor -LRB- Cnr1 -RRB- and CCK in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , a brain region critical for emotion regulation .

25173075|Human thalamic and amygdala modulation in emotional scene perception . .

25173075|While a growing body of research supports the perspective that emotional perception is organized via amygdala feedback to rostral ventral visual cortex , the contributions of high-order thalamic structures strongly associated with visual attention , specifically the mediodorsal nucleus and pulvinar , have not been well investigated .

25173075|Consistent with recent research , the latency of emotional discrimination across subcortical and visual cortical regions suggests a role for the amygdala in the early evaluation of scene emotion .

25173075|These data support the perspective that higher order visual thalamic structures are sensitive to the emotional value of complex scene stimuli , and may serve in concert with amygdala and fusiform gyrus to modulate visual attention toward motivationally relevant cues .

25172313|Functional magnetic resonance imaging data have suggested that moderate pressure massage was represented in several brain regions including the amygdala , the hypothalamus and the anterior cingulate cortex , all areas involved in stress and emotion regulation .

25165065|We used a new functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- paradigm varying 3 parameters : emotional valence , emotional congruency , and allocation of attention , to distinguish the functional variation in activity and connectivity between amygdala , anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- .

25165065|Top-down resolution of emotional conflict was associated with increased activity within ACC and higher functional connectivity between this structure , and both the amygdala and DLPFC .

25151338|To assess pair-wise comparisons and potential confounders , mean activation data were extracted only from clusters within regions previously implicated in emotion regulation -LRB- including amygdala and ventral prefrontal regions -RRB- .

25151094|By these means we could reveal that three key structures contribute to building up the feeling of self , namely insula -LRB- interoceptive modulator -RRB- , amygdala -LRB- emotional modulator -RRB- and putamen -LRB- motor modulator -RRB- .

25127926|We used a genetic neuroimaging approach to investigate whether a genetic variation of the noradrenergic system impacts stress-induced neural activity in amygdala and hippocampus during recognition of emotional memory .

25127926|Deletion carriers showed decreased neural activity in the amygdala when recognizing emotional faces in control condition and increased amygdala activity under stress .

25127926|Noncarriers showed no differences in emotional modulated amygdala activation under stress or control .

25127926|The genotype-dependent effects of acute stress on neural activity in amygdala and hippocampus provide evidence for noradrenergic-glucocorticoid interaction in emotional memory retrieval .

25100166|Analyses of emotional face recognition fMRI studies showed significantly greater convergence of amygdala hyperactivation among BD-youths than BD-adults .

25100166|Our data suggest that amygdala , prefrontal , and visual system hyperactivation is important in the emotional dysfunction present in BD-youths , as well as that anterior cingulate cortex hypoactivation is relevant to the cognitive deficits in BD-youths .

25059532|We tested the effect of the ?2 adrenoceptor agonist guanfacine on psychophysiological interactions of amygdala with prefrontal cortex for the emotional biasing of response execution and inhibition .

25059532|Guanfacine moderated the effect of face emotion on the task-related functional connectivity of left and right amygdala with left inferior frontal gyrus compared to placebo , by selectively reversing the functional co-activation of the two regions for response execution cued by sad faces .

25059532|These results demonstrate the importance of functional interactions between amygdala and inferior frontal gyrus to both bottom-up biasing of cognitive control and top-down control of emotional processing , as well as for the ?2 adrenoceptor-mediated modulation of these processes .

25018086|Here we employ rapid sampling of BOLD signal -LRB- 4 Hz -RRB- in the amygdala , fusiform gyrus -LRB- FG -RRB- , FEF and IPS in 42 human participants as they viewed a series of emotional and neutral natural scene photographs balanced for luminosity and complexity , to test whether emotional discrimination is evident in dorsal structures prior to such discrimination in the amygdala and FG .

25018086|Results demonstrate emotionally-enhanced peak BOLD signal in the amygdala , FG , FEF , and IPS , with the onset of BOLD signal discrimination occurring between 2 and 3s after stimulus onset in ventral structures , and between 4 and 5s in FEF and IPS .

25018086|Consistent with a reentrant perspective of emotional scene perception , greater directional connectivity was found from the amygdala to FG compared to the reverse .

25018086|These data support a perspective in which the registration of emotional scene content is orchestrated by the amygdala and rostral inferotemporal visual cortex .

25012679|These impairments appear to be related to possible damage in brain regions underling emotional networks , including the anterior cingulate cortex , amygdala , and medial prefrontal cortex .

24997351|Previous work has shown that carriers of the ADRA2B Glu -LRB- 301 -RRB- - Glu -LRB- 303 -RRB- deletion variant exhibit enhanced emotional memory , greater amygdala responses to emotional stimuli and greater intrusiveness of traumatic memories .

24995938|Individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- exhibit heightened amygdala reactivity and atypical activation patterns in the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- in response to negative emotional information .

24995938|We examined blood oxygen level dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- response to viewing and actively down-regulating emotional responses to negative stimuli in regions previously associated with PTSD , including the amygdala , hippocampus , and mPFC , as prospective predictors of posttraumatic symptom onset .

24995938|Increased BOLD signal to negative emotional stimuli in the left amygdala was strongly associated with posttraumatic symptoms following the attack .

24990928|These results suggest that MeCP2 directly represses G9a as a shared mechanism in central amygdala for regulation of emotional responses to pain and opioid reward , and for their behavioral interaction .

24984244|These results provide consistent evidence for the role of amygdala activity in experienced emotional intensity , where intentional dampening and exaggeration are clearly expressed .

24984080|These receptors are found throughout the limbic system , including the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BlA -RRB- , which is involved in forming associations between emotional stimuli and environmental cues , and the central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , which is implicated in the expression of conditioned responding to emotional stimuli .

24982200|Neurons in the human amygdala selective for perceived emotion . .

24982200|The human amygdala plays a key role in recognizing facial emotions and neurons in the monkey and human amygdala respond to the emotional expression of faces .

24982200|Following the same analyses , we showed that hippocampal neurons , unlike amygdala neurons , only encoded emotions but not subjective judgment .

24982200|Our results suggest that the amygdala specifically encodes the subjective judgment of emotional faces , but that it plays less of a role in simply encoding aspects of the image array .

24982200|The conscious percept of the emotion shown in a face may thus arise from interactions between the amygdala and its connections within a distributed cortical network , a scheme also consistent with the long response latencies observed in human amygdala recordings .

24976633|Therefore , we proposed an extended PTSD-based neurobiological model for emotion modulation in DID : the hypo-aroused identity state activates the prefrontal cortex , cingulate , posterior association areas and parahippocampal gyri , thereby overmodulating emotion regulation ; the hyper-aroused identity state activates the amygdala and insula as well as the dorsal striatum , thereby undermodulating emotion regulation .

24966371|The medial nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- MeA -RRB- plays a key role in innate emotional behaviors by relaying olfactory information to hypothalamic nuclei involved in reproduction and defense .

24966371|These findings provide a description of the cellular organization and connectivity of the MePV and further our understanding of amygdala circuits involved in olfactory processing and innate emotions .

24963529|We relate behavioural observations to four major networks of the social brain , that is , Amygdala , Mentalizing , Emotion and Mirror networks .

24954829|Finally , all children with greater life trauma showed greater bilateral amygdala and cingulate activity specific to sad faces but not the other emotional faces , although right amygdala activity was moderated by psychiatric status .

24948801|In direct contrast , neuronal ensembles in the BLA were only reactivated at test if animals had been fear conditioned , suggesting that the amygdala specifically tracks the emotional properties of a context .

24948801|Collectively , these data provide crucial insight into the region-specific behavior of neuronal ensembles during contextual fear conditioning and demonstrate a dissociable role for the hippocampus and amygdala in processing the contextual and emotional properties of a fear memory .

24945924|It has been recognized that the amygdala is involved in emotional processes and also a critical site of neuronal plasticity for fear conditioning .

24939872|Prediction errors to emotional expressions : the roles of the amygdala in social referencing . .

24939872|This suggests that the amygdala plays two roles in social referencing : -LRB- i -RRB- initiating learning regarding the valence of an object as a function of prediction errors to expressions displayed toward this object and -LRB- ii -RRB- orchestrating an emotional response to the object when value judgments are being made regarding this object .

24936178|Studies investigating the neurophysiological basis of intrapersonal emotion regulation -LRB- control of one 's own emotional experience -RRB- report that the frontal cortex exerts a modulatory effect on limbic structures such as the amygdala and insula .

24935250|By using Fos protein as a marker , we found that sensory and emotion related brain regions were activated at day 7 after the treatment with zymosan ; these regions include the prefrontal cortex , anterior cingulate cortex , insular cortex and amygdala .

24929864|We propose that the prefrontal cortex facilitates fear memory through the integration of sensory and emotional signals and through the coordination of memory storage in an amygdala-based network .

24928767|LDA subjects had significantly better emotion recognition scores and showed relatively more activity in several brain areas associated with alexithymia and emotional awareness -LRB- anterior cingulate cortex -RRB- , and the extended system of facial perception concerned with aspects of social communication and emotion -LRB- amygdala , insula , striatum -RRB- .

24926249|The goal of this study was to use neuroimaging to test what the unique contribution is of depression and anxiety symptomatology on emotional processing and amygdala activation , and to compare the results with a healthy control group .

24926249|To conclude , this study shows that abnormal amygdala responses to emotional faces in depression and anxiety seems to be more dependent on anxiety symptoms than on depression symptoms , and thereby highlights the need for more research to better characterize clinical groups in future studies .

24923421|More important , a larger GMV of the bilateral amygdala was associated with better interval perception , suggesting that the amygdala , which is the neural substrate of emotional processing , is also involved in music processing .

24923421|In sum , our study provides one of first neuroanatomical evidence on the association between the amygdala and music , which contributes to our understanding of exactly how music evokes emotional responses .

24920616|The primate amygdala sends dense projections to posterior orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- pOFC -RRB- in pathways that are critical for processing emotional content , but the synaptic mechanisms are not understood .

24920135|Here we discuss a putative mechanism that may explain how alcohol consumption influences emotional processing and subsequent aggressive responding , via disruption of orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- - amygdala connectivity .

24917798|The memory-enhancing effect of emotion has been linked to the engagement of emotion - and memory-related medial temporal lobe -LRB- MTL -RRB- regions -LRB- amygdala-AMY ; hippocampus-HC ; parahippocampus-PHC -RRB- , during both encoding and retrieval .

24911391|During exposure to the comfortable scenery , significant activation was observed in the calcarine gyrus selectively , whereas the uncomfortable scenery induced significant activation in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex , which are related to cognitive control , as well as in the medial prefrontal cortex , hippocampus , parahippocampal gyrus , amygdala , and insula , which are involved in the regulation and expression of emotion .

24905284|Thus , unlike some neurological and developmental disorders featuring amygdala dysfunction , the emotion recognition deficit observed in FTD is not likely driven by selective inattention to critical facial features .

24904907|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- plays a critical role in modulating emotional processing , in part , via dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- regulation of GABA transmission .

24904351|As prior studies have suggested that prefrontal regions may guide and regulate emotional memory search via functional connections with the amygdala , the current analysis focused on functional connectivity between the left amygdala and the left prefrontal cortex , and structural integrity of the uncinate fasciculus , a white matter tract connecting prefrontal and temporal regions .

24904066|Results from the current study show the amygdala to be a critical hub in the emotion processing network : specifically one that influences not only the higher order areas involved in the evaluation of a stimulus 's emotional value but also the sensory cortical areas involved in the processing of its low-level acoustic features .

24904065|Negative Urgency Mediates the Relationship between Amygdala and Orbitofrontal Cortex Activation to Negative Emotional Stimuli and General Risk-Taking . .

24904065|Emotional cue-induced activation in right lateral OFC and left amygdala might relate to emotion-based risk-taking through negative urgency .

24894766|Regulating emotion to improve physical health through the amygdala . .

24894766|Importantly , individuals who had larger gray matter -LRB- GM -RRB- volume in the amygdala reported not only a higher ability of emotion regulation but also better physical health .

24894766|Further , GM volume in the amygdala mediated the correlation between emotion regulation ability and physical health .

24894766|Our findings suggest that the amygdala plays a critical role in the neural circuit through which emotion regulation may influence physical health .

24890646|The amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex contain neural pathways through which positive emotions probably trigger cataplectic attacks .

24884791|Does the amygdala response correlate with the personality trait ` harm avoidance ' while evaluating emotional stimuli explicitly ? .

24884567|The amygdala plays a key role in emotional-affective aspects of pain .

24884567|In conclusion , nasal application of NPS can inhibit emotional-affective , but not sensory , pain-related behaviors through an action in the amygdala .

24882568|The amygdala is a central node in the brain network that processes aversive emotions and is extensively innervated by dorsal raphe nucleus -LRB- DRN -RRB- serotonin -LRB- 5-hydroxytryptamine -LSB- 5-HT -RSB- -RRB- neurons .

24882568|To answer this question , we investigated the relationship between DRN 5-HT1A receptor availability and amygdala reactivity to aversive emotion and functional connectivity within the amygdala-cortical network .

24882568|Our data show that DRN 5-HT1A receptor availability is linked specifically to the processing of aversive emotions in the amygdala and the modulation of amygdala-cortical connectivity .

24882567|The amygdala is a key structure in serotonergic emotion-processing circuits .

24882567|These results demonstrate that acute treatment with psilocybin decreased amygdala reactivity during emotion processing and that this was associated with an increase of positive mood in healthy volunteers .

24874919|The presented data implies that 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 variants and neuroticism are linked by resting state functional connectivity of amygdala and fusiform gyrus and suggests that variants of 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 genotype and different levels of neuroticism may partly account for altered processing of negative facial emotions .

24866521|The amygdala mediates the emotional modulation of threat-elicited skin conductance response . .

24866521|The amygdala is a critical component of the neural circuit that mediates many emotion-related processes , and thus likely plays an important role in modulating the peripheral emotional response to threat .

24866521|Thus , understanding the factors that influence the amygdala 's response to threat is critical for a complete understanding of adaptive emotional processes .

24866521|We also assessed whether changes in amygdala activity varied with the peripheral expression of emotion -LRB- indexed via skin conductance response ; SCR -RRB- .

24866521|The results showed that threat-elicited amygdala activation varied with the arousal , not valence , of emotional images .

24866521|In turn , the amygdala appears to mediate important aspects of the peripheral emotional response to threat .

24865373|Compared with control groups , participants with a history of DSH did not exhibit greater negative emotional reactivity but did exhibit lower ability to regulate emotion with reappraisal -LRB- greater self-reported negative emotions in Study 1 and greater amygdala activation in Study 2 during regulation -RRB- .

24862989|Here we briefly review how early postnatal adversity determines structure and function of the hippocampus , amygdala , and prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- areas , which are crucial for proper cognitive and emotional function .

24862297|Multiple linear regressions showed that ELS , specifically emotional abuse , predicted reduced rs-FC between the right amygdala and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- pgACC -RRB- , which in turn predicted elevated state anxiety after psychosocial stress .

24862171|Individual differences in the intensity of feelings of arousal while viewing emotional pictures have been associated with the magnitude of task-evoked blood-oxygen dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- response in the amygdala .

24862077|Using psychophysiological interaction -LRB- PPI -RRB- analysis , we investigated sex-based differences in functional connectivity with a key emotion-processing region -LRB- amygdala , AMG -RRB- and a key reward-processing area -LRB- ventral striatum , VS -RRB- in response to high vs. low energy-dense -LRB- ED -RRB- food images using blood oxygen level-dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- in obese persons in fasted and fed states .

24858795|Correlations between self-reported ES and brain responses to the facial affect stimuli -LRB- affective > neutral -RRB- were evaluated within the brain regions involved in emotional processing , including the amygdala , insula , anterior cingulate cortex , medial prefrontal cortex , and orbitofrontal cortex .

24853295|The pattern of abnormal or reduced connectivity between DLPFC and amygdala may reflect abnormal modulation of mood and emotion typical of bipolar patients .

24847228|Noradrenergic activation of the basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is well known to enhance the consolidation of long-term memory of highly emotionally arousing training experiences .

24847112|Animal studies reveal that the amygdala promotes attention and emotional memory , in part , by driving activity in downstream target regions including the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- and hippocampus .

24841618|Neuroimaging studies have indicated that people with alexithymia show structural and functional alterations in brain areas associated with emotional awareness , as amygdala , insula , anterior cingulate cortex , fusiform gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus , and only occasionally alterations in the cerebellar activity were reported .

24839437|In the context of emotion information processing , several studies have demonstrated the involvement of the amygdala in emotion perception , for unimodal and multimodal stimuli .

24839437|However , it seems that not only the amygdala , but several regions around it , may also play a major role in multimodal emotional integration .

24839437|These new findings suggest that a damaged amygdala , or a disrupted bundle between the amygdala and the ventral part of the occipital lobe , has a greater impact on emotion perception in the visual modality than it does in either the vocal or audiovisual one .

24836853|Experiences with a high degree of emotional salience are better remembered than events that have little emotional context and the amygdala is thought to play an important role in this enhancement of memory .

24836853|Understanding the mechanisms of amygdala-perirhinal cortex plasticity will allow a greater understanding of how emotionally-charged events are remembered .

24835267|In contrast , females demonstrated a stronger positive relation between emotion regulation ability and rGMV in an anatomical cluster that extends from the left brainstem to the left hippocampus , the left amygdala and the insular cortex .

24828372|The aberrant RSFC of the amygdala network and the dACC network may be related to altered emotion processing and regulation in depressed adolescents .

24818080|However , modulation of amygdala hyperactivation by attentional distraction - an effective emotion regulation strategy in healthy individuals - has not yet been examined .

24818080|Attentional distraction seemed to dampen emotional processing of disorder-relevant stimuli via amygdala downregulation .

24816942|We investigated the relationship between social avoidance and emotion-potentiated startle , a probe of amygdala activation , in children and adolescents with FXS , developmental disability without FXS -LRB- DD -RRB- , and typical development .

24810870|Changes in the left amygdala signal with escitalopram treatment during processing of emotional stimuli were linearly related to the 5-HTTLPR 'S ' allele load such that the signal to positive stimuli decreased and the signal to negative stimuli increased with an increasing number of low-expressing 'S ' alleles .

24810870|While preliminary , our findings comprise the first pharmacogenetic study demonstrating an effect of the 5-HTTLPR 'S ' allele load on escitalopram-induced changes in amygdala activity during emotional processing , consistent with a 5-HTT expression dosage model .

24808872|The increase in amygdala activation in both the '' permit '' and '' view '' conditions renders both strategies as suitable baseline conditions for studies of cognitive emotion regulation .

24804219|In addition , we observed that -LRB- 1 -RRB- patients were less able to downregulate amygdala activation with recruitment of more dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- dlPFC -RRB- when adopting detachment strategy regardless of valence , and this preserved ability to regulate emotion was inversely associated with severity of symptoms ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- patients had deficits in upregulating amygdala activation when adopting immersion strategy , with less inferior frontal gyrus -LRB- IFG -RRB- activation and strengthening coupling of dlPFC and ventral medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- with amygdala ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- comparison between groups yielded that patients showed stronger vmPFC activation under either self-detached or self-immersed condition .

24802075|Related to affective ToM , psychopaths had hypoactivation in amygdala , inferior prefrontal gyrus and superior temporal sulcus , areas associated with embodied simulation of emotions and intentions .

24800628|Our findings indicate that conventional metaphorical expressions are more emotionally evocative than literal expressions , as the amygdala and the anterior portion of the hippocampus were more active in the metaphorical sentences .

24796655|The existing literature on the role of emotion regulation circuits -LRB- amygdala-prefrontal cortex -RRB- in the adolescent brain yields mixed results , particularly on the role of these regions in the context of reward sensitivity and risk-taking behavior sensitivity and risk-taking behavior .

24796287|The amygdala was also modulated by emotion , regardless of the accuracy of discrimination .

24796287|In this sample , amygdala activation was enhanced and DG/CA3 activation was diminished during emotional discrimination compared to those without depressive symptoms .

24795437|Intrinsic emotional expressions such as those communicated by faces and vocalizations have been shown to engage specific brain regions , such as the amygdala .

24795437|Our results confirmed the importance of fear in emotional communication , as revealed by significant blood oxygen level-dependent signal increased in a cluster within the posterior amygdala and anterior hippocampus , as well as in the posterior insula across all three domains .

24795437|Moreover , subject-specific amygdala responses to fearful music and vocalizations were correlated , consistent with the proposal that the brain circuitry involved in the processing of musical emotions might be shared with the one that have evolved for vocalizations .

24788335|Specifically , as caudate and amygdala volumes deviate from the typical R > L asymmetry , and cortical gray matter becomes more R > L asymmetrical , overall SRS and Emotion Recognition scores increase .

24782735|Here , we tested the fusiform gyrus and amygdala sensitivity to emotional face information conveyed by these distinct pathways in ASD individuals -LRB- and matched Controls -RRB- .

24778610|Neuroscience research over the past few decades has reached a strong consensus that the amygdala plays a key role in emotion processing .

24777547|In our work , we intended to investigate the effect of vitamin A on emotional behavior and morphology of nitrergic neurons in basolateral nucleus of the rat amygdala .

24769166|Our results suggest that the emotional processing network is altered in tinnitus to rely on the parahippocampus and insula , rather than the amygdala , and this alteration may maintain a select advantage for the rapid processing of affective stimuli despite the hearing loss .

24760033|The left and right amygdalae are key regions distinctly involved in emotion-regulation processes .

24756342|Role of FKBP5 in emotion processing : results on amygdala activity , connectivity and volume . .

24755617|In the present study , we investigated the response of amygdala and the visual cortex to novelty , by comparing functional MRI activity between 1st and 2nd time presentation of a series of emotional faces in an event-related task .

24753211|Within the inhibited group , those with fewer social anxiety symptoms and better emotion regulation skills had greater ACC activation and greater functional connectivity between the ACC and amygdala .

24753197|Differential effects of early life stress on hippocampus and amygdala volume as a function of emotional abilities . .

24753197|Previous studies in clinical populations have shown that hippocampus and amygdala , two central structures of limbic emotion processing circuits , are predominantly affected by early stress exposure .

24753197|We , therefore , investigated the volume of hippocampus and amygdala in 25 high alexithymic -LRB- h-ALEX -RRB- and 25 low alexithymic -LRB- l-ALEX -RRB- individuals , which were matched with regard to ELS , but significantly differed in their degree of emotional functioning .

24752071|Therefore , we investigated functional -LRB- amygdala responsiveness and functional connectivity during threat-related emotion processing -RRB- and structural -LRB- grey matter volume -RRB- imaging markers associated with separation anxiety as measured with the Relationship Scale Questionnaire in a large sample of healthy adults from the Münster Neuroimaging Cohort -LRB- N = 320 -RRB- .

24752071|The main results were positive associations of separation anxiety scores with amygdala reactivity to emotional faces as well as increased amygdala grey matter volumes .

24751161|Previous studies in constitutive NCAM null mutants identified emotional behaviour deficits related to disturbances of hippocampal and amygdala functions .

24748761|High risk subjects , compared to low risk , exhibited greater left amygdala activation -LRB- t = 3.60 , df = 6 , p = 0.01 -RRB- , suggesting they may exhibit hyper-responsivity of the amygdala in response to emotional stimuli .

24747193|The present study investigated emotional and cognitive impairments in an animal model of persistent inflammatory pain as well as the involvement of the basolateral complex -LRB- BLC -RRB- of the amygdala in these components .

24747193|Our findings further support a crucial role of amygdala in the effect of morphine on emotional/cognitive components of pain and not on mechanical hypersensitivity .

24745955|Hyperreactivity of the amygdala has been linked to negatively biased emotional processing in depression .

24742618|Traditional emotion-based perspectives link emotional impairment mostly to alterations in amygdala-ventromedial frontal circuits .

24738077|Our results demonstrated abnormal gamma activity within 100 ms in the emotion-related regions -LRB- amygdala , orbitofrontal -LRB- OFC -RRB- cortex , anterior insula -LRB- AI -RRB- , and superior temporal pole -RRB- in the MDD patients , suggesting that these patients may have dysfunctions or negativity biases in perceptual binding of emotional features at very early stage .

24735671|Angry expressions also activated the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , and the latter correlated with pupil size as an indicator of bodily arousal during emotional output behavior .

24723867|Early work on the amygdala placed this small structure as a key component in the regulation of emotion and affective behavior .

24721524|Several studies show the role of the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- in drug-seeking , relapse and the brain ? s emotional systems .

24719001|Six mechanism of actions for which neurological underpinnings have been published are : attention regulation -LRB- anterior cingulate cortex -RRB- , body awareness -LRB- insula , temporoparietal junction -RRB- , emotion regulation -LRB- modulation of the amygdala by the lateral prefrontal cortex -RRB- , cognitive re-evaluation -LRB- activation of the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex or diminished activity in prefrontal regions -RRB- , exposure/extinction/reconsolidation -LRB- ventromedial prefrontal cortex , hippocampus , amygdala -RRB- and flexible self-concept -LRB- prefrontal median cortex , posterior cingulated cortex , insula , temporoparietal junction -RRB- .

24708929|The basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- acts as a filter for aversive stimuli to higher structures while the central -LRB- CeA -RRB- and the medial -LRB- MeA -RRB- nuclei constitute the output for the autonomic and somatic components of the emotional reaction through major projections to the limbic and brainstem regions .

24708929|Although some findings point to the distinct participation of the substance P -LRB- SP -RRB- and the NK1 receptors system in the different nuclei of the amygdala on the expression of emotional behaviors , it is not clear if this system modulates anxiety-like responses in the distinct nuclei of the amygdala as well as the dPAG .

24703785|Task-based and resting state neuroimaging studies have disclosed an altered effective connectivity between regions dedicated to emotional regulation in children with ADHD when compared to typically developing children , notably between the amygdala , the prefrontal cortex , the hippocampus and the ventral striatum .

24703785|Bottom-up related emotional dysregulation involves an increased emotional reactivity , and is thought to be linked to the automatic evaluative activity of the amygdala .

24697675|Results suggest that different dimensions of psychopathy are related to distinct facial emotion processing mechanisms and support the existence of both amygdala deficits and compensatory engagement of cortical structures for emotional processing in psychopathy .

24690370|When participants were administered escitalopram relative to placebo , left amygdala activity was increased and right inferior frontal gyrus -LRB- IFG -RRB- activity was decreased during presentation of positive pictures -LRB- potentiation of positive emotion processing -RRB- .

24690370|In contrast , escitalopram was associated with decreased left amygdala and increased right IFG activity during presentation of negative pictures -LRB- attenuation of negative emotion processing -RRB- .

24688456|The amygdaloid complex is a key brain structure involved in the expression of behaviors and emotions such as learning , fear , and anxiety .

24686896|In this study , on a rat model of chronic pain , we determined how persistent pain altered behavioral responses to morphine reward measured by the paradigm of unbiased conditioned place preference -LRB- CPP -RRB- , focusing on GABAergic synaptic activity in neurons of the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , an important brain region for emotional processing of both pain and reward .

24682003|Results showed that the regulation of negative emotion led to reverse task-rest interactions -LRB- decreased activation during stimulation but increased activation during fixation -RRB- in the amygdala as well as in visual cortex regions and to concordant task-rest interactions -LRB- increased activation during both , stimulation and fixation -RRB- in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as well as in a number of brain regions at the intersection of the default mode and the dorsal attention networks .

24678289|Concomitantly multiple areas , including the amygdala , monitor ongoing overt behaviors -LRB- the expression itself -RRB- and the covert , autonomic responses that accompany emotional expressions .

24671141|The results linked proactive aggression in youths with CU traits to hypoactive amygdala responses to emotional distress cues , consistent with theories that externalizing behaviors , particularly proactive aggression , in youths with these traits stem from deficient empathic responses to distress .

24669790|Thus , this study highlights the reciprocal relation between amygdalar and ventromedial PFC in the encoding of emotional valence as reflected by facial expression .

24668615|Given the importance of the amygdala in representing negative affect , the aversive emotional reaction to loss , rather than aberrant estimations of probability or loss magnitude , may underlie risk seeking for losses .

24666527|We demonstrate that amygdala-frontal co-activation patterns differentiate effective from ineffective anxiolytic treatments and that SSRI and placebo responders share overlapping neuromodulatory paths that may underlie improved emotion regulation and reduced expression of anxiety .

24662929|For both patients and healthy volunteers , the medial prefrontal and core limbic parts of the emotional network -LRB- for example , anterior cingulate , amygdala and thalamus -RRB- were increased in response to positive emotions but decreased to negative emotions by repeated antidepressant administration .

24662774|Additionally , we found a higher reactivity in the patients ' amygdala to emotional relative to neutral faces when compared to healthy controls .

24661171|Previous studies have emphasized that antisocial personality disorder -LRB- APD -RRB- and psychopathy overlap highly but differ critically in several features , notably negative emotionality -LRB- NEM -RRB- and possibly amygdala reactivity to social signals of threat and distress .

24661171|Here we examined whether dimensions of psychopathy and APD correlate differentially with NEM and amygdala reactivity to emotional faces .

24661171|Testing these relationships among healthy individuals , dimensions of psychopathy and APD were generated by the profile matching technique of Lynam and Widiger -LRB- 2001 -RRB- , using facet scales of the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised , and amygdala reactivity was measured using a well-established emotional faces task , in a community sample of 103 men and women .

24661157|We examined associations of regions of interest -- the amygdala and other cortical regions subserving a potential role in deficient cognitive control and elaborative emotion-processing -- with trait rumination .

24647945|When attention was available for processing the distractor pictures , negative pictures resulted in behavioral interference , neural activation in brain regions previously related to emotion , a transient decrease of blood pressure , and a positive correlation between blood pressure response and activation in a network including prefrontal and parietal regions , the amygdala , caudate , and mid-brain .

24643418|The amygdala is a key-player in the expression of emotions , receives direct nociceptive information from the parabrachial nucleus , and is densely innervated by noradrenergic brain centers .

24643418|In addition to the involvement of the amygdala in negative emotions during the perception of pain , this brain structure is also a target site for many neuromodulators to regulate the perception of pain .

24634648|Ex vivo dissection of optogenetically activated mPFC and hippocampal inputs to neurons in the basolateral amygdala : implications for fear and emotional memory . .

24633938|SIB appear to be an inadequate strategy to regulate negative emotions that may be related to social/psychological pain , by increasing dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation in order to regulate amygdala activation .

24628842|The neural circuitry underlying emotional learning is known to involve the amygdala and hippocampus , although the precise impact of amyloid pathology on the interaction between these brain regions remains unclear .

24624054|Given similar impaired decision-making abilities and spared modulation of fear after both neonatal lesions of either OFC areas 11 and 13 or amygdala -LRB- Kazama et al. , 2012 ; Kazama and Bachevalier , 2013 -RRB- , the present results suggest that interactions between these two neural structures play a critical role in the development of behavioral adaptation ; an ability essential for the self-regulation of emotion and behavior that assures the maintenance of successful social relationships .

24623457|The amygdala and the hippocampus are two adjacent structures in the medial temporal lobe that have been broadly investigated in functional and structural neuroimaging due to their central importance in sensory perception , emotion , and memory .

24619536|Our primary analysis was seed based , extracting connectivity between visual cortex and the amygdala -LRB- because of its role in fear and negative emotion -RRB- and visual cortex and the hippocampus -LRB- because of its role in memory -RRB- .

24618674|Conflict in the context of deliciousness resulted in increased amygdala activation , possibly due to the resulting '' negative '' emotion in incongruent versus congruent combinations .

24617738|Decreased amygdala and IFG modulation in patients with BD and AR youth may be pathophysiological risk markers for BD , and may underlie the social cognition and face emotion labeling deficits observed in BD and AR youth .

24607231|The central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- is a key structure at the limbic-motor interface regulating stress responses and emotional learning .

24603023|We demonstrate that amygdala responses to emotional movies spill over to subsequent processing of threat information in a valence-specific manner : negative movies enhance later amygdala activation whereas positive movies attenuate it .

24603023|These results suggest that intensity and valence of emotional events as well as anxiety levels promote local changes in amygdala sensitivity to threat , highlighting the importance of past experience in shaping future affective reactivity .

24603021|First , focusing away from emotion led to decreased self-reported emotional responses , along with increased engagement of ER-related regions -LRB- ventro-medial prefrontal cortex , vmPFC -RRB- , and reduced activity in emotion-related regions -LRB- amygdala , AMY -RRB- .

24600410|Imaging studies of major depressive disorder -LRB- MDD -RRB- have demonstrated enhanced resting-state activity of the amygdala as well as exaggerated reactivity to negative emotional stimuli relative to healthy controls -LRB- HCs -RRB- .

24600410|Compared with HCs , MDD patients showed a wide-spread reduction in the intrinsic connectivity of the amygdala with a variety of brain regions involved in emotional processing and regulation , including the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex , insula , caudate , middle and superior temporal regions , occipital cortex , and cerebellum , as well as increased connectivity with the bilateral temporal poles -LRB- p < 0.05 corrected -RRB- .

24600410|Although the directionality of connections between regions can not be inferred from temporal correlations , the reduced intrinsic connectivity of the amygdala predominantly with regions involved in emotional processing may reflect impaired bottom-up signaling for top-down cortical modulation of limbic regions leading to abnormal affect regulation in MDD .

24583373|How the amygdala affects emotional memory by altering brain network properties . .

24583373|The amygdala has long been known to play a key role in supporting memory for emotionally arousing experiences .

24583373|In this paper we will discuss that these developments will likely lead to an updated view of the amygdala as a critical nexus within large-scale networks supporting different aspects of memory processing for emotionally arousing experiences .

24583338|Although dopamine transmission in the amygdala plays a key role in emotional processing , there has been no direct evidence about how valproic acid acts on the dopaminergic system in the brain during emotional processing .

24583338|In the present study , we tested the effect of valproic acid on a trait marker of vulnerability to emotional stress in psychosis , which is excess dopamine release in response to a fear-conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- in the basolateral complex of the amygdala of methamphetamine-sensitized rats .

24583338|The results prove that valproic acid inhibits spontaneous dopamine release and also attenuates excess dopaminergic signaling in response to emotional stress in the amygdala .

24577108|Pride and shame/guilt conditions both activated typical emotion-processing circuits including the amygdala , insula and ventral striatum , as well as self-referential brain regions such as the bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex .

24576352|Pain is characterized as a complex experience , dependent not only on the regulation of nociceptive sensory systems , but also on the activation of mechanisms that control emotional processes in limbic brain areas such as the amygdala and the hippocampus .

24575774|A cortico-limbic network consisting of the amygdala , medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- , and ventral striatum -LRB- vSTR -RRB- has been associated with altered function in emotional disorders .

24575774|These findings provide direct evidence that during visual perception of evocative emotional stimuli , reduced reward-related activity in dysphoria is associated with dysfunctional causal connectivity between mPFC , amygdala , and vSTR .

24574071|Functional neuroimaging data suggest that the underlying neural substrate involves hyperactivation in the amygdala to affective facial stimuli , and altered activation in the anterior cingulate , inferior frontal gyrus and the superior temporal sulcus particularly during social emotion processing tasks .

24565362|Abnormal amygdala functional connectivity associated with emotional lability in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder . .

24565362|The amygdala is implicated in emotion regulation , but its connectivity and relation to emotion regulation in ADHD has yet to be explored .

24565362|The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between intrinsic functional connectivity -LRB- iFC -RRB- of amygdala circuits and emotion regulation deficits in youth with ADHD .

24565362|First , we examined the relationship between amygdala IFC and parent ratings of emotional lability -LRB- EL -RRB- in children with ADHD .

24565362|In children with ADHD and a range of EL , deficits in emotion regulation were associated with altered amygdala-cortical iFC .

24565362|When comparing groups that differed on ADHD status but not EL , differences in amygdala iFC were small and nonsignificant , highlighting the specificity of this finding to emotional deficits , independent of other ADHD symptoms .

24564471|This result suggests that the accumbens and amygdala activity of prosocials encodes '' outcome-oriented emotion '' designed to change situations -LRB- i.e. , achieve equity or punish -RRB- .

24564461|Other work has implicated the dorsal ACC -LRB- dACC -RRB- in cognitive-emotional control and the amygdala in emotional arousal .

24557332|The perception of facial emotions -- cues from the left amygdaloid complex . .

24557332|The history and the behavioral profile of 2 patients with brain abnormalities in the region of the left amygdaloidal complex might suggest that the dysfunction of the neural pathways related to the left amygdala has to occur at an early developmental stage to result in impaired emotional judgments of facial expressions .

24557332|This is in line with the hypothesis that emotional information processing is based on a distributed neural network which , during ontogenesis , gradually expands from the amygdala and the amygdaloidal complex to further components of the limbic system .

24554670|Although the amygdala is important for emotional learning and other behaviors , including fear and anxiety , whether learning alters intrinsic excitability within the amygdala has received very little attention .

24552785|Functional neuroimaging studies on music and emotion show that music can modulate activity in brain structures that are known to be crucially involved in emotion , such as the amygdala , nucleus accumbens , hypothalamus , hippocampus , insula , cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex .

24551159|Our results showed that extraversion was negatively correlated with GMV of the bilateral amygdala , the bilateral parahippocampal gyrus , the right middle temporal gyrus , and the left superior frontal gyrus , all of which are involved in emotional and social cognitive processes .

24530294|The offenders , relative to the non-offenders , exhibited reduced response time interference and a different pattern of conflict - and error-related activity in brain areas involved in cognitive control , attention , language , and emotion processing , that is , the anterior cingulate , dorsolateral prefrontal , superior temporal and postcentral cortices , putamen , thalamus , and amygdala .

24529281|We then tested whether variants showing significant association with PD are also associated with amygdala volume -LRB- n = 1048 -RRB- or task-evoked reactivity to emotional stimuli -LRB- n = 103 -RRB- in healthy individuals .

24528558|Previous neuroimaging studies have suggested an abnormal neural circuitry of emotion regulation including the amygdala and prefrontal cortex in both adult and adolescent generalized anxiety disorder -LRB- GAD -RRB- patients .

24525224|Research in humans has highlighted the importance of the amygdala for transient modulation of cortical areas for enhanced processing of emotional stimuli .

24523683|Recollection of emotional memories is attributed in part to the activation of the amygdala and the hippocampus .

24523535|Together , these data suggest that BDNF-TrkB signaling is critical for amygdala-dependent learning of both appetitive and aversive emotional memories .

24503959|In contrast , passive tasks reliably engaged regions associated with visual and emotional information processing , including lingual gyrus and the amygdala .

24497992|Increased amygdala and posterior insula activations , known to be related to sensory perception of emotional stimuli , distinguish shame from guilt responses in remitted MDD .

24497992|Shame-induction may be a more sensitive probe of residual amygdala hypersensitivity in MDD compared with facial emotion-evoked responses previously found to normalize on remission .

24494684|This review will focus on the supraspinal mGluRs , whose pharmacological manipulation generates a variety of effects , which depend on the synaptic location , the cell type on which they are located , and the expression in particular pain modulation areas , such as the periaqueductal gray , which plays a major role in the descending modulation of pain , and the central nucleus of the amygdala , which is an important center for the processing of emotional information associated with pain .

24493840|In addition , CEM has been linked to amygdala hyperactivity during emotional face processing .

24493840|Our findings suggest that CEM may increase individuals ' risk to the development of psychopathology on differential levels of processing in the brain ; blunted mPFC activation during higher order processing and enhanced amygdala activation during automatic/lower order emotion processing .

24492919|On a neural level , individuals with BPD showed structural and functional abnormalities in a fronto-limbic network including regions involved in emotion processing -LRB- e.g. , amygdala , insula -RRB- and frontal brain regions implicated in regulatory control processes -LRB- e.g. , anterior cingulate cortex , medial frontal cortex , orbitofrontal cortex , and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -RRB- .

24478811|The current findings suggest that the PFC and amygdala support learning-related processes that impact the magnitude of the emotional response to a threat .

24478669|However , it is not known whether amygdala damage affects emotional memory performance at immediate and delayed recall , and whether its involvement is modulated by stimulus valence .

24468408|Activity in the amygdala and hippocampus decreased with age when processing emotional salient stimuli versus neutral stimuli .

24465436|These results are interesting in light of predominant theories regarding amygdala-mediated emotional reactivity observed in functional imaging studies of MDD .

24452696|Within the brain , the anteroventral subdivision of the medial amygdala -LRB- MeAV -RRB- is an important area involved in processing emotional responses such as anxiety and a high density of NO-producing neurons is observed in this area .

24447769|The amygdala , but not the posterior STS , demonstrated a greater response to blocks in which each movie morphed from neutral to a different emotion category compared to blocks in which each movie morphed to the same emotion category .

24447769|These results are consistent with a role of the amygdala in category-based representation of facial expressions of emotion .

24439664|Instead , anatomical , neurophysiological , functional neuroimaging , and neuropsychological evidence is described that anterior limbic and related structures including the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala are involved in emotion , reward valuation , and reward-related decision-making -LRB- but not memory -RRB- , with the value representations transmitted to the anterior cingulate cortex for action-outcome learning .

24439664|In primates including humans this learning can be very rapid and rule-based , with the orbitofrontal cortex overshadowing the amygdala in this learning important for social and emotional behaviour .

24434194|Evidence for altered amygdala activation in schizophrenia in an adaptive emotion recognition task . .

24434194|The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate emotion-specific amygdala activation in schizophrenia using a novel adaptive emotion recognition paradigm .

24427267|These data indicate that individuals utilize two different neural routes for forming and retrieving integrations depending on their emotional content , and they suggest a potentially disruptive role for the amygdala on frontal and medial-temporal regions during negative integration .

24425869|The amygdala , a structure involved in processing emotional stimuli , expresses ?2 and ?1 subunits at high levels .

24416328|Despite the prominent role of emotion in regulating normal perception , the neural interface between emotion-processing regions such as the amygdala and auditory regions involved in perception remains relatively unexplored in AVH .

24399958|We explored the role of amygdaloid complex -LRB- AC -RRB- and medial temporal lobe -LRB- MTL -RRB- in emotional memory recognition across development , by comparing fMRI activations of successful memory encoding of fearful and neutral faces in children -LRB- n = 12 ; 8-12 years -RRB- and adolescents -LRB- n = 12 ; 13-17 years -RRB- .

24399179|Among the identified regions , the amygdala/hippocampus formed a cluster associated with emotional processes and memory functions .

24381534|Consequently , the intensity of emotion attached to human reciprocity was represented in the amygdala , whereas insight into the reciprocity of others was reflected in activation across the reward-related and ToM regions .

24380867|First , right amygdalar activity associated with emotional memory strength was enhanced by prior perceptual processing .

24380867|Second , prior perceptual processing of emotional pictures produced a stronger effect on recollection - than familiarity-related activations in the right amygdala and left hippocampus .

24377682|The adaptation of emotional conflict , on the other hand , is suggested to be related to the rostral anterior cingulate inhibiting the processing of emotional distractors through a top-down modulation of amygdala responsivity .

24376834|Pharmacological evidence suggests that the neuropeptide somatostatin -LRB- SST -RRB- exerts anxiolytic action via the amygdala , but findings concerning the putative role of endogenous SST in the regulation of emotional responses are contradictory .

26958466|Specifically , since regions of the anterior Default Mode Network -LRB- DMN -RRB- are centrally involved in emotional regulation via connections with limbic regions , such as the amygdala , remediation of maladaptive behavioral and cognitive patterns as a result of CBT for chronic pain would manifest itself as a change in the intrinsic functional connectivity -LRB- iFC -RRB- between these prefrontal and limbic regions .

26401296|Major findings comprise structural as well as functional alterations of brain regions involved in emotion processing , such as amygdala , insula , and prefrontal regions .

24371127|And consequently this can induce an overreaction of the amygdala to negative emotional stimuli .

24367308|Differential activation of amygdala Arc expression by positive and negatively valenced emotional learning conditions . .

24367308|Recent evidence suggests that the valence of emotionally laden encounters may generate lateralized , as opposed to symmetric release of this transmitter in the right or left amygdala .

24367307|The amygdala has traditionally been associated with fear , mediating the impact of negative emotions on memory .

24361663|Homozygous carriers of the risk allele were observed to show relatively increased functional connectivity between the right amygdala and frontal regions that play a key role in emotion processing and regulation -LRB- e.g. the cingulate and prefrontal cortex -RRB- .

24349161|On fMRI , the PTSD group showed decreased activation in the inferior frontal cortex , inferior parietal lobule , insula and putamen , and increased activation in posterior cingulate cortex and amygdala during up-regulation of negative emotion .

24348351|In addition , the multivariate El-Himdi and Roy tests demonstrate that the amygdala , prefrontal cortex , and pars opercularis -LRB- inferior frontal gyrus -RRB- play key roles when processing emotional expressions .

24333573|Differential role of the basolateral amygdala 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 serotonin receptors upon ACPA-induced anxiolytic-like behaviors and emotional memory deficit in mice . .

24333573|The critical role of cannabinoidergic and serotonergic systems of the amygdala in modulation of anxiety-like behaviors and emotional memory has already been demonstrated .

24333573|The present study aimed to investigate the possible role of the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 serotonergic systems upon ACPA -LRB- CB1 cannabinoid receptor agonist -RRB- - induced anxiolytic-like behaviors and emotional memory impairment using the elevated plus-maze -LRB- EPM -RRB- test-retest paradigm in male mice .

24321346|In this special issue , Ernst -LRB- 2014 -RRB- outlines the triadic systems model , which focuses on the balanced interaction among three functional neural systems : the prefrontal cortex -LRB- regulation/control -RRB- , striatum -LRB- motivation/approach -RRB- , and amygdala -LRB- emotion/avoidance -RRB- .

24319416|Regions known to participate in the formation of emotional memories , such as the basolateral amygdala , also promote gamma-band activation throughout cortical and subcortical circuits .

24318124|We focus on the hypothalamus , hippocampus , amygdala , nucleus accumbens , prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex , key brain regions that not only modulate emotions and cognition but also the response to stress itself , and discuss disorders like depression , post-traumatic stress disorder , Cushing syndrome and dementia .

24314348|Acute effects of heroin on negative emotional processing : relation of amygdala activity and stress-related responses . .

24314348|Our results show a direct relation between the acute heroin effects on stress-related emotions , stress reactivity , and left amygdala response to negative facial expressions .

24298171|Evidence from cross-modal studies motivated a predefined three-region network for multisensory integration of emotion , consisting of fusiform gyrus -LRB- FG -RRB- , amygdala -LRB- AMY -RRB- and anterior superior temporal gyrus -LRB- aSTG -RRB- .

24298171|In conclusion , fusiform to amygdala coupling strength is modulated via feedback through aSTG as region for multisensory integration of emotional material .

24298171|Therefore , soundtrack valences may modulate emotion elicitation in movies by differentially changing preprocessed visual information to the amygdala .

24290464|The results of the study imply that differences exist in visual regions of the brain 's face processing system and are not solely isolated to emotional brain regions such as the amygdala .

24279756|Early life stress -LRB- ELS -RRB- causes alterations in emotionality and anxiety levels as a significant risk factor for psychiatric problems , and these alterations have been associated with amygdala activity .

24277819|Although recent work has focused on the amygdala as the locus of aversive memory formation , the hypothalamus has long been implicated in emotional regulation , and the hypothalamic neuropeptide orexin -LRB- hypocretin -RRB- is involved in anxiety states and arousal .

24268662|High childhood anxiety is also associated with increased connectivity between the amygdala and distributed brain systems involved in attention , emotion perception , and regulation , and these effects are most prominent in basolateral amygdala .

24268662|Individual differences in anxiety can be reliably detected with high predictive value in amygdala-centric emotion circuits at a surprisingly young age .

24262816|To assess the influence of OCD symptom dimensions on amygdala responses to a well-validated emotional face-matching paradigm .

24259585|Trait anxiety was also positively correlated with amygdala-based '' emotional '' system activation and its coupling with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- when decisions were consistent with the framing effect , but negatively correlated with the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- dACC -RRB- - based '' analytic '' system activation and its connectivity to the vmPFC when decisions ran counter to the framing effect .

24258969|The results suggest a state-dependent model depicting a flattened and aberrant response of amygdala to emotion discrimination that could explain the seemingly contradictory previous findings of hypo - and hyper-amygdala activation .

24241476|Real-time neurofeedback using functional MRI could improve down-regulation of amygdala activity during emotional stimulation : a proof-of-concept study . .

24241476|The amygdala is a central target of emotion regulation .

24241476|Therefore , we developed a task that trained participants to down-regulate activity of the right amygdala while being confronted with amygdala stimulation , i.e. negative emotional faces .

24231734|The affected brain regions may include the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , where plasticity of glutamatergic synapses in principal neurons plays a role in conditioned emotional responses .

24229536|In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study of healthy adolescents , we found that prior exposure to severe adverse life events was associated with current anxiety and with increased amygdala reactivity to standardized emotional stimuli -LRB- viewing of fearful faces relative to calm ones -RRB- .

24229536|Conjunction analyses identified multiple regions , including the amygdala , insula , and prefrontal cortex , in which reactivity to emotional faces covaried with life events as well as with current anxiety .

24229474|Specifically , activation in brain regions involved in emotional processing , such as the anterior temporal pole and amygdala , was most strongly associated with better treatment response .

24223175|Prefrontal control of the amygdala during real-time fMRI neurofeedback training of emotion regulation . .

24223175|We observed in a previous study -LRB- PLoS ONE 6 : e24522 -RRB- that the self-regulation of amygdala activity via real-time fMRI neurofeedback -LRB- rtfMRI-nf -RRB- with positive emotion induction was associated , in healthy participants , with an enhancement in the functional connectivity between the left amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- and six regions of the prefrontal cortex .

24219776|It is well established that the amygdala is crucially involved in the processing of facial emotions .

24219776|In schizophrenia patients , a number of neuroimaging findings suggest hypoactivation of the amygdala in response to facial emotion , while others indicate normal or enhanced recruitment of this region .

24219776|Recent research examining the automatic processing of facial emotion has also reported amygdala hyperactivation in schizophrenia .

24219776|In the present study , we focused on the time-course of amygdala activation during the automatic processing of emotional facial expression .

24219776|We hypothesized that in comparison to healthy subjects , patients would initially show hyperresponsivity of the amygdala to masked emotional and neutral faces .

24219776|In addition , we expected amygdala deactivation in response to masked facial emotions from the first to the second phase to be more pronounced in patients than in controls .

24198772|Previous neuroimaging studies have consistently showed increased amygdala activity during the presentation of negative stimuli or regulation of negative emotion in the homozygous short allele carriers , suggesting the key role of amygdala response in mediating increased risk for depression .

24188795|In addition , the posteromedial cortical nucleus of the amygdala shows moderate interconnections with the associative -LRB- basomedial -RRB- amygdala and with the ventral hippocampus , which may be involved in emotional and spatial learning -LRB- respectively -RRB- induced by chemical signals .

24185015|Functional MRI data revealed a network of regions involved in directed attention to emotional information for both positive and negative pictures that included medial and lateral prefrontal cortices , fusiform gyrus , insula , the parahippocampal gyrus , and the amygdala .

24184115|In trials showing emotional expressions compared to neutral trials univariate analysis showed activation primarily in bilateral amygdala , fusiform gyrus , middle temporal gyrus/superior temporal sulcus and inferior occipital gyrus .

24182621|The amygdala complex plays a key role in stress-induced emotional processing and in the fear memory formation .

24167496|Functional connectivity analyses revealed connections between seed regions in the left ACC and right insular cortex with reward regions , the amygdala , and frontal regions associated with emotion regulation .

24167308|Neuropsychological evidence is not yet conclusive but suggests that women show heightened amygdala reactivity to threatening stimuli , may be better able to exert prefrontal cortical control over emotional behaviour and may consciously register fear more strongly via anterior cingulate activity .

24156808|The human amygdala is reliably activated by facial expressions -LSB- 1 -RSB- , but the precise functional relevance of such activity change is not well understood , because most previous studies did not allow for separating effects of the emotional expression from the distribution of specific facial features and neglected corresponding attentional processes .

24148846|Convergent evidence suggests dysfunction within the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- and amygdala , important components of a neural system that subserves emotional processing , in individuals with major depressive disorder -LRB- MDD -RRB- .

24148846|In this study , we used functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- to investigate amygdala-PFC functional connectivity during emotional face processing in medication-naive individuals with MDD .

24148846|Medication-naive individuals with MDD showed decreased amygdala-left rPFC functional connectivity in response to negative emotional stimuli , suggesting that abnormalities in amygdala-left rPFC neural circuitry responses to negative emotional stimuli might play an important role in the pathophysiology of MDD .

24145409|Animal work and human cross-sectional studies both suggest that chronic stressor exposure is associated with amygdala and prefrontal cortex regions important for emotion regulation .

24145409|Adults with lower family income at age 9 exhibited reduced ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity and failure to suppress amygdala activation during effortful regulation of negative emotion at age 24 .

23995157|These studies also suggest an increase in cortical activation -LRB- nucleus accumbens and amygdala -RRB- when processing emotional information , which is also increased during adolescence .

24133426|The amygdala , insula and medial prefrontal cortex exhibited evidence of dimensional -LRB- linear -RRB- processing that correlated with physical changes in the emotional face stimuli .

24133419|Huntington 's disease -LRB- HD -RRB- is characterized by triad of motor , cognitive , and emotional symptoms along with neuropathology in fronto-striatal circuit and limbic system including amygdala .

24133419|In the transgenic rat model -LRB- tgHD rats -RRB- , evidence suggest emotional alterations at the symptomatic stage along with neuropathology of the central nucleus of amygdala -LRB- CE -RRB- .

24133419|In the first experiment , we characterized the acute effect of an emotion -LRB- fear -RRB- conditioned stimulus on temporal discrimination using a bisection procedure , and tested its dependency upon an intact central amygdala .

24133419|The results contribute to our knowledge about the presymptomatic phenotype of this HD rat model , showing susceptibility to emotion that may be related to dysfunction of the central nucleus of amygdala .

24132937|In line with this , the transgenic group showed a higher number of c-Fos + nuclei in central and basolateral amygdala , a result that supports the early involvement of the emotionality factor in AD pathology .

24128307|Test-retest reliability of amygdala response to emotional faces . .

24128307|In the current study , we evaluated the test-retest reliability of amygdala response using an emotional face-matching task that has been widely used to examine pathophysiology and treatment mechanisms in psychiatric populations .

24127578|Both placebo responses were associated with similar patterns of activation increase in circuitry involved in emotion appraisal , including the pregenual anterior cingulate , medial orbitofrontal cortex , amygdala , accumbens , and midbrain structures .

24124415|The piriform cortex and the amygdala both project to the orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- which with the amygdala is involved in emotion and associative learning , and to the entorhinal/hippocampal system which is involved in long-term memory including episodic memory .

24120094|Although human functional neuroimaging studies have reported that oxytocin effects on social behavior and emotional states are mediated by amygdala function , animal models indicate that oxytocin receptors in the ventral striatum -LRB- VS -RRB- modulate sensitivity to social reinforcers .

24114951|The amygdala plays a critical role in emotional processing and has been implicated in the etiology of numerous psychiatric disorders .

24111237|Emotional centers including the right amygdala and bilateral insula were activated by the second piece -LRB- emotional attachment -RRB- but not by the first piece .

24108802|Disrupted effective connectivity between the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex in social anxiety disorder during emotion discrimination revealed by dynamic causal modeling for FMRI . .

24108802|We used dynamic causal modeling -LRB- DCM -RRB- , a method to evaluate effective connectivity , to test our hypothesis that SAD patients would exhibit dysfunctions in the amygdala-prefrontal emotion regulation network .

24108802|The emotion-processing network was identified by a task-related contrast and motivated the selection of the right amygdala , OFC , and DLPFC for DCM analysis .

24105875|There is recent evidence of continuing development throughout adolescence in two neural areas involved in emotion and cognition , the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLN -RRB- and the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- .

24105443|Social anxiety disorder -LRB- SAD -RRB- has been associated with hyper-reactivity in limbic brain regions like the amygdala , both during symptom provocation and emotional face processing tasks .

24105443|Within the SAD group , social anxiety severity correlated positively with amygdala reactivity to emotional faces , amygdala-fusiform connectivity and connectivity between the amygdala and superior temporal sulcus -LRB- STS -RRB- .

24102648|The nuclei of the human amygdaloid complex can be distinguished from each other on the basis of their cytoarchitecture , chemistry and connections , all of which process the information needed for the different functions -LRB- ranging from attention to memory and emotion -RRB- of the amygdala .

24100022|This novel evidence for the role of Pet-1 in fear processing and dendritic organization of amygdala neurons and in human amygdala threat processing extends a growing literature demonstrating the influence of genetic variation in the serotonin system on emotional regulation via effects on structure and function of underlying corticolimbic circuitry .

24097376|However , it remains unclear whether the amygdala 's response to fear reflects its role in the interpretation of danger and threat , or whether it is to some extent activated by all facial expressions of emotion .

24097376|Overall , these findings are consistent with the role of the amygdala in processing threat , rather than in the processing of all facial expressions of emotion , and demonstrate the critical importance of the choice of comparison condition to the pattern of results .

24095880|In our regions of interest , we observed phasic , rather than sustained , activation during sustained threat in dorsolateral and inferior frontal regions , anterior and dorsal cingulate , ventral striatum and regions associated with emotion , including the amygdala , insula , substantia nigra and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis complex .

24095683|Imbalance and reorganization of amygdala-mPFC interactions may not only be important for persistent pain , but also for disorders characterized by the abnormal persistence of emotional-affective states such as drug and alcohol addiction .

25508091|The survey also gives information about changes in the exchange of serotonine in the Amygdala 's structures in the process of alimentary , maternal , aggressive-defensive and emotional behavior .

25508091|Systematizes the data on the role of serotonin and sex steroids in the mechanisms involved in the stress response of Amygdala , and its participation in the formation of mood , emotions and the genesis of depression .

25438560|The survey also gives information about changes in the exchange of serotonine in the Amygdala 's structures in the process of alimentary , maternal , aggressive-defensive and emotional behavior .

25438560|Systematizes the data on the role of serotonin and sex steroids in the mechanisms involved in the stress response of Amygdala , and its participation in the formation of mood , emotions and the genesis of depression .

24069183|In addition , during emotional processing there was an effect of genotype in a cluster including the amygdala and hippocampus .

24068800|Reciprocal circuits between the mPFC and basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- are particularly important for emotional control .

24067301|Oxytocin promotes facial emotion recognition and amygdala reactivity in adults with asperger syndrome . .

24066700|The amygdala was responsive to emotional , animacy , and looming information -LRB- particularly to looming threats and looming animate stimuli -RRB- .

24064198|The amygdala is a critical hub in the neural fear network , receptive to change using emotion regulation strategies and a putative target for iCBT .

24045078|The amygdala is an important center for emotional behavior , and it influences other cortical regions .

24040190|MEG evidence for dynamic amygdala modulations by gaze and facial emotions . .

24040190|While the role of amygdala in the perception of facial emotion and gaze has been extensively highlighted with fMRI , the unfolding in time of amydgala responses to emotional versus neutral faces with different gaze directions is scarcely known .

24040190|We found an early peak of amygdala activity that was enhanced for fearful relative to neutral faces between 130 and 170 ms. The effect of emotion was again significant in a later time range -LRB- 310-350 ms -RRB- .

24040190|Altogether , our results show that the amygdala is involved in the processing and integration of emotion and gaze cues from faces in different time ranges , thus underlining its role in multiple stages of face perception .

24039023|On the functional neurobiological level , specific brain regions involved in the processing of anxiety-laden stimuli and in emotion regulation have been shown to be hyperactive and hyper-responsive in SAD such as amygdala , insula and orbito - and prefrontal cortex .

24038516|Dysfunctional amygdala responsiveness during emotion processing has been implicated in both disorders , but the important rapid and automatic stages of emotion processing in the amygdala have so far never been investigated in bipolar patients .

24038516|Univariate analysis revealed a significant group × emotion interaction within the left amygdala .

24038516|Distinct amygdala excitability during automatic stages of the processing of emotional faces may reflect differential pathophysiological processes in BD versus MDD depression , potentially representing diagnosis-specific neural markers mostly unaffected by current psychotropic medication .

24036129|Overall , our data demonstrate that right TLE has a more maladaptive impact on emotion-related networks , in ways specific to the amygdala region , and the emotion symptom involved , than left TLE .

24009565|Laboratory-based episodic memory studies , using micro-events -LRB- pictures/words -RRB- , point to a role of the amygdala -LRB- AMY -RRB- , an emotion-based region , in the encoding and retrieval of emotionally valenced memories .

24008143|Many of the emotional and social deficits point to defects in the amygdala .

24005309|The amygdala is a key component of the brain emotional system ; however , an understanding of how various emotions are differentially processed in the amygdala has yet to be achieved .

24005305|The noradrenergic -LRB- NA -RRB- projections arising from the locus ceruleus -LRB- LC -RRB- to the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis have been implicated in the formation of emotional memory .

24004528|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- plays a key role in fear-related learning and memory , in the modulation of cognitive functions , and in the overall regulation of emotional behavior .

24002084|Our previous experiments demonstrated that systemic depletion of serotonin -LRB- 5-hydroxytryptamine , 5-HT -RRB- , similar to levels reported in patients with emotional disorders , enhanced glutamateric activity in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- and potentiated fear behaviors .

23990890|We suggest that the insula and the amygdala contribute specifically to the happy emotional connotation of the facial expressions depending on the task .

23986807|Time-frequency statistical parametric mapping analyses revealed that the amygdala showed gamma-band activation in response to emotional expressions , gazes and faces , with peak latencies at about 100 ms , 200 ms and 250 ms , respectively .

23986266|The reported interaction effects demonstrate that gender strongly modulates the relationship between 5-HTTLPR genotype and subclinical expression of anxiety acting on amygdala , one region of the emotional neural network specifically involved in the anxiety-like behaviours .

23986238|The prefrontal and insula cortex , amygdala , and striatum are key regions for emotional processing , yet the amygdala 's role as an interface between the cortex and striatum is not well understood .

23986238|This arrangement suggests a stepwise integration of the functions of these circuits across amygdala subregions , providing a potential mechanism through which internal emotional states are managed with external social and sensory information toward emotionally informed complex behaviors .

23977455|Elevated amygdala responses to emotional faces in youths with chronic irritability or bipolar disorder . .

23977455|Amygdala dysfunction during face emotion processing is well-documented in BD , but little is known about amygdala dysfunction in chronically irritable youth .

23977455|Thus , during implicit face emotion processing , youth with BD and those with SMD exhibit similar amygdala dysfunction but different abnormalities in regions involved in information monitoring and integration .

23968960|Antenatal maternal cortisol levels associate with alterations in the amygdala , a structure associated with emotion regulation , in the offspring .

23957449|Associated changes in the expression of genes encoding for markers of glial activation and cytokines were subsequently examined in the amygdala , a key brain region for the modulation of emotion and pain .

23954749|It became increasingly clear , however , that cannabinoid CB1 receptors are also abundantly expressed in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and other limbic regions where they modulate emotional arousal effects on memory .

23954749|I propose a model suggesting that the ameliorating effects of exogenously administered cannabinoids on emotional learning after acute stress are mediated by the decrease in the activity of the HPA axis via GABAergic mechanisms in the amygdala .

23950019|The amygdala and ventral prefrontal cortex are two major nodes of a corticolimbic circuit involved in processing and regulating responses to emotional stimuli .

23948633|High-risk individuals showed increased emotional reactivity to negative stimuli , indicated by heightened amygdala activation during passive viewing .

23946406|Our findings show that deprivation to other-race faces in infancy disrupts recognition of emotion and results in heightened amygdala response to out-group faces .

23946006|There is increasing evidence for a role of the amygdala in processing gaze direction and emotional relevance of faces .

23940666|The amygdala is suspected to be a potential structure for the pain chronicity due to its critical role in processing negative emotions and pain information .

23940666|These results suggest that BLA activities in the early stage after nerve injury might be crucial to the development of pain chronicity , and amygdala-related negative emotions and pain-related memories could promote pain chronicity .

23937887|The amygdala plays a key role in the emotional-affective component of pain , pain modulation and affective disorders .

23937887|The data suggest that 5-HT2CR in the amygdala , especially in the BLA , limits the effectiveness of SSRIs to inhibit pain-related emotional-affective behaviors .

23935231|As a preliminary step , we conducted a proof-of-concept study to test whether particular emotion regulatory neural circuitry can be differentially targeted by specific neurocognitive tasks , and whether these tasks effectively inhibit amygdala activity .

23932915|The amygdala , as part of the limbic system , is involved in emotion and reward , and the insula in interoception .

23921647|Scalp electrophysiological studies have supposed that emotional intensity is processed from about 170 ms. However , this is inconsistent with the rapid emotion detection of the amygdala at around 100 ms. Besides , it is unreasonable to apply this assertion to all emotional types considering emotional-specific neural networks and fast/slow emotional routes .

23921647|These results coincided with the emotional detection function of the amygdala and the view of a re-entrant mechanism in emotion recognition .

23919984|While SUD samples have typically shown increased activity in the cognitive control regions -LRB- ie , lateral prefrontal and dorsal anterior cingulate -RRB- , during attentional bias such increases appear to have been insufficient for the concomitant increases in processing by the emotion/reward regions -LRB- ie , amygdala , insula , and striatum -RRB- .

23916537|Therapy for combat and accident-related posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- has been reported to influence amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- response during emotional processing .

23916537|We hypothesized that cognitive trauma therapy for battered women -LRB- CTT-BW -RRB- would alter insula , amygdala , and cingulate responses during anticipation and presentation of emotional images .

23914157|Inhibitory networks of the amygdala for emotional memory . .

23914157|The amygdala is important for emotional memory , including learned fear .

23914157|A number of studies for amygdala neural circuits that underlie fear conditioning have elucidated specific cellular and molecular mechanisms of emotional memory .

23911835|The functional imaging indicated that , in the presence of negative relative to neutral distractors , the PTSD group showed higher activation in the emotion processing regions , including amygdala , precuneus and fusiform gyrus , but lower activation in the inferior frontal cortex , insula and left supramarginal gyrus than the control group .

23911256|Altered amygdala activation in schizophrenia patients during emotion processing . .

23908624|It is proposed that the amygdala serves as a gateway by articulating the mood regulatory sensorimotor stimulation with the central affective circuitry by emotionally labeling and mediating the storage of such emotional events in long-term memory .

23903032|Follow-up connectivity analysis on the emotion-matching task showed that amygdala-hypothalamus coupling was also reduced .

23898315|Specifically , increased activity in the amygdala and across mesolimbic dopaminergic regions during REM sleep is likely to promote the consolidation of memory traces with high emotional/motivational value .

23891883|We demonstrate that murine X-monosomy -LRB- XO -RRB- causes -LRB- i -RRB- accentuation of XX vs XY differences in a set of sexually dimorphic structures including classical foci of sex-hormone action , such as the bed nucleus of the stria terminal and medial amygdala , -LRB- ii -RRB- parietal and striatal abnormalities that recapitulate those reported TS , and -LRB- iii -RRB- abnormal development of brain systems relevant for domains of altered cognition and emotion in both murine and human X-monosomy .

23887817|Feature-based representations of emotional facial expressions in the human amygdala . .

23886515|During the processing of negative emotional stimuli , alexithymia was associated with a diminished response of the amygdala , suggesting decreased attention to such stimuli .

23886514|SSRIs decreased amygdala responses , suggesting reduced emotional reactivity to emotional stimuli , whereas NRIs increased frontal and medial activation , suggesting increased emotion regulation .

23880959|Affective deficits are one common denominator of schizophrenia -LRB- SZ -RRB- , bipolar disorder -LRB- BD -RRB- and obsessive compulsive disorder -LRB- OCD -RRB- with the amygdala indicated as one of the major structures involved in emotion regulation .

23872141|The role of the amygdala and the basal ganglia in visual processing of central vs. peripheral emotional content . .

23871880|Here , we report data from two twins with bilateral amygdala lesions due to Urbach-Wiethe syndrome and show they are unimpaired in a multinomial emotional prosody classification task .

23861215|Exaggerated amygdala and reduced ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- responsiveness during emotional processing have been reported in studies examining individual anxiety disorders .

23860484|Future studies will need to determine whether amygdala volume mediates the impact of stathmin and serotonin transporter gene variants on normal and dysfunctional emotion processing .

23856065|In the present study , we utilized ovariectomized adult female rhesus monkeys undergoing hormone replacement with E2 to test the hypothesis that the chronic psychosocial stress of subordination alters GABAAR binding potential -LRB- GABAAR BPND -RRB- in limbic regions implicated in emotional processing including the prefrontal cortex , temporal lobe -LRB- amygdala and hippocampus -RRB- , and hypothalamus .

23852106|The authors then present an overview of the effects of exogenous administration of glucocorticoids on cognitive performance and emotional processing via effects on medial temporal lobe and prefrontal structures , including the amygdala , hippocampus , and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex .

23851324|Thus , heightened engagement of the amygdala was observed for happy child and angry adult faces , which may reflect age-specific salience of select emotions in early life .

23843821|Aggressive behavior arises in the brain through interplay between subcortical structures in the amygdala and the hypothalamus in which emotions are born and the prefrontal cognitive centers where emotions are perceived and controlled .

23843821|Neuroimaging techniques in adult males have shown that testosterone activates the amygdala enhancing its emotional activity and its resistance to prefrontal restraining control .

23831498|The amygdala is a heterogeneous , medial temporal lobe structure that has been implicated in the formation , expression and extinction of emotional memories .

23831498|In particular the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- , central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , and the basal -LRB- B -RRB- nucleus contribute an essential role to emotional learning .

23827769|Central to the neurocircuitry regulating emotion are functional interactions between the amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- .

23827769|However , only a few studies have examined amygdala-vmPFC connectivity in the context of emotional processing in PTSD .

23827769|The aim of the present research was to investigate the hypothesis that PTSD is associated with disrupted functional connectivity of the amygdala and vmPFC in response to emotional stimuli , extending previous findings by demonstrating such links in an understudied , highly traumatized , civilian population .

23827769|The findings are consistent with previous findings showing PTSD is associated with an exaggerated response of amygdala-mediated emotional arousal systems .

23825407|Enhanced visual cortical activation for emotional stimuli is preserved in patients with unilateral amygdala resection . .

23825407|A predominant model for the preferential processing and attention to emotional stimuli posits that the amygdala modulates sensory pathways through its projections to visual cortices .

23825407|However , recent behavioral studies have found intact perceptual facilitation of emotional stimuli in individuals with amygdala damage .

23825407|To determine the importance of the amygdala to modulations in visual processing , we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine visual cortical blood oxygenation level-dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- signal in response to emotionally salient and neutral images in a sample of human patients with unilateral medial temporal lobe resection that included the amygdala .

23825407|Our results indicate that neither the right nor left amygdala is necessary for the heightened visual cortex BOLD responses observed during emotional stimulus presentation .

23818882|This review discusses a possible link between the neuroadaptations in the extended amygdala stress systems and the resulting pathological plasticity that could facilitate recruitment of new emotiona l memory circuits in the hippocampus as a function of aberrant DG neurogenesis .

23809145|The pgACC participates with the amygdala in processing the salience of emotional stimuli .

23806980|Diffuse neurodegeneration of limbic regions -LRB- e.g. , prefrontal cortex -LSB- PFC -RSB- , amygdala -RRB- was demonstrated in ALS post-mortem , although the mechanisms of emotional dysregulati on in ALS in vivo remain unclear .

23805313|Fear recognition was associated with the right amygdala ; disgust recognition with the left insula ; anger recognition with the left middle and superior temporal gyrus ; and sadness recognition with the left subcallosal cingulate , indicating that discrete neural substrates are necessary for emotion recognition in frontotemporal dementia .

23802123|While little is known about the neurobiological substrates that underlie EI , some evidence suggests that these capacities may involve a core neurocircuitry involved in emotional decision-making that includes the ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- , anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , insula , and amygdala .

23800487|Disrupted amygdala activity in depressed adolescents and adults while viewing facial expressions of emotion has been reported .

23800487|In addition , relationships between increased amygdala activity during face processing and disruptions in parent-reported emotion regulation and negative affect were found .

23800481|Some mechanisms that contribute to poor ER in ASD may be shared with other clinical populations -LRB- e.g. , physiologic arousal , degree of negative and positive affect , alterations in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex -RRB- , whereas other mechanisms may be more unique to ASD -LRB- e.g. , differences in information processing/perception , cognitive factors -LSB- e.g. , rigidity -RSB- , less goal-directed behavior and more disorganized emotion in ASD -RRB- .

23797147|Neural substrates impacted by sleep deprivation include the prefrontal cortex , basal ganglia and amygdala and result in difficulties with executive functioning , reward anticipation and emotional reactivity respectively .

23785160|Although there is no sensory cortex and hence no conscious vision , some cortically blind patients show amygdala activation in response to facial or bodily expressions of emotion .

23776244|Children with ASD also showed underconnectivity between right-hemisphere pSTS , a region known for processing speech prosody , and the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala , brain regions critical for emotion-related associative learning .

23775606|During this period , the amygdala , a structure that mediates social and emotional behaviors , is changing in terms of neural and glia density .

23770086|Increases in SSNA occurred when subjects viewed emotionally charged images , resulting in increases in activity in the central and lateral amygdala , dorsolateral pons , thalamus , nucleus accumbens , and cerebellar cortex ; surprisingly , there was no activation of the insula in response to these emotional stimuli .

23769997|The amygdala encodes level of perceived fear but not emotional ambiguity in visual scenes . .

23769997|There are two current models of amygdala functioning with regard to identification of emotional expression .

23769997|Classic models propose that the amygdala contributes to emotional expression recognition and empathy by encoding the level of threat or distress , and as such , responds greatest to more potent fearful cues .

23769997|The present study used fMRI to investigate amygdala functioning during the perception and identification of emotion in complex visual scenes .

23769997|In contrast , no activity was observed that would indicate that the amygdala was modulated by emotional ambiguity when discriminating between fearful and disgusting visual scenes .

23769997|These results are consistent with models that implicate the amygdala in the evaluation and representation of the intensity of fear , and imply that the functional contribution of the amygdala to deciphering threat in visual scenes likely extends beyond the search for emotionally salient features .

23769997|The results also suggest that using attention to remedy emotion recognition abnormalities in at-risk populations with amygdala dysfunction may not address all key deficits associated with contributions of the amygdala to emotion and empathy .

23769293|However , enhanced amygdala responsiveness to negative emotional cues was only observed to target -LRB- attended -RRB- expressions .

23766733|Of particular interest is the effect of chronic stress on the amygdala , which plays a key role in the regulation of emotional responses and memory consolidation .

23765157|Existing models broadly agree that reappraisal recruits frontal and parietal control regions to modulate emotional responding in the amygdala , but they offer competing visions of how this is accomplished .

23765157|An alternative view is that control regions modulate semantic representations in lateral temporal cortex that indirectly influence emotion-related responses in the amygdala .

23765157|Furthermore , while previous work has emphasized the amygdala , whether reappraisal influences other regions implicated in emotional responding remains unknown .

23765157|This suggests that reappraisal involves the use of cognitive control to modulate semantic representations of an emotional stimulus , and these altered representations in turn attenuate activity in the amygdala .

23761775|Given that the vmPFC is known to regulate amygdala activity during emotional processing , we subsequently compared the perfusion in the vmPFC and the amygdala in depression-vulnerable -LRB- having early-life stress and high in rumination -RRB- and resilient -LRB- having early-life stress and high in mindfulness -RRB- subjects .

23761770|The first goal yielded two findings : -LRB- 1 -RRB- emotional pictures that disrupted face WM but enhanced subsequent EM were associated with increased amygdala -LRB- AMY -RRB- and hippocampal activity -LRB- ventral system -RRB- coupled with reduced dorsolateral PFC -LRB- dlPFC -RRB- activity -LRB- dorsal system -RRB- ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- trials in which emotion enhanced EM without disrupting WM were associated with increased ventrolateral PFC activity .

23761741|Second , coping with emotional distraction involves top-down control in order to counteract the bottom-up influence of emotional distraction , and involves interactions between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex .

23755254|Previous studies suggest that amygdala , insula and prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- disintegrity play a crucial role in the failure to adequately regulate emotions in Borderline Personality Disorder -LRB- BPD -RRB- .

23755254|We thus scrutinized the link between PFC , amygdala , insula , and the ability to regulate emotions , contrasting 17 women with BPD without comorbid PTSD to 27 non-clinical control women and in addition to those with BPD and PTSD -LRB- n = 14 -RRB- .

23755254|Furthermore , cortical thickness in the DLPFC of BPD women without PTSD positively correlated with emotion regulation scores and furthermore was positively associated with amygdala volume , as well as cortical thickness of the insula .

23754441|The findings of both animal and human studies provide compelling evidence that stress-induced activation of the amygdala and its interactions with other brain regions involved in processing memory play a critical role in ensuring that emotionally significant experiences are well-remembered .

23752096|Neural circuits within the amygdala regions , such as the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , and downstream targets such as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- , are critical neuroanatomical structures for orchestrating emotional behavioral responses that may influence motivated actions such as the reinstatement of drug seeking behavior .

23750128|We found that younger and older adults showed similar patterns of activation in the frontopolar OFC and the amygdala during emotional reversal learning .

23747571|Our hypothesis is that the negative emotional state that drives such negative reinforcement is derived from dysregulation of key neurochemical elements involved in the brain stress systems within the frontal cortex , ventral striatum , and extended amygdala .

23746615|The influence of combined cognitive plus social-cognitive training on amygdala response during face emotion recognition in schizophrenia . .

23746615|Results were strongest for emotion recognition of happy , surprise and fear : relative to CG participants , AT+SCT participants showed a neural activity increase in bilateral amygdala , right putamen and right medial prefrontal cortex .

23746615|Among AT+SCT participants alone , neural activity increase in right amygdala predicted behavioral improvement in emotion perception .

23745764|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and ventral subiculum -LRB- vSub -RRB- of the hippocampus convey emotion and context information , respectively , to the nucleus accumbens -LRB- NAc -RRB- .

23739970|We hypothesized that the amygdala is functionally important for cataplexy because the amygdala has a role in processing emotional stimuli and it contains neurons that are active during cataplexy .

23739970|These observations demonstrate that the amygdala is a functionally important part of the circuitry underlying cataplexy and suggest that increased amygdala activity in response to emotional stimuli could directly trigger cataplexy by inhibiting brainstem regions that suppress muscle atonia .

23739962|The amygdala plays an important role in the formation and storage of memories associated with emotional events .

23734117|Analysis of the activation profile of the left amygdala corresponded to the three emotional conditions , and this profile was obtained for both sessions regardless of glucose level .

23732229|By testing the behavioral effects of SSRI treatment on Pavlovian fear conditioning , a well characterized model of emotional learning , we have the opportunity to identify how SSRIs affect the functioning of specific brain regions , including the amygdala , bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- and hippocampus .

23719209|Healthy and maladaptive emotional processing involve the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , dysfunction of which has been implicated in numerous psychiatric disorders .

23719128|For example , it has been shown that the ventral , but not the dorsal , hippocampus reciprocally connects with the amygdala and influences emotional behaviours .

23718645|MRI volumetric and signal analysis of changes in cortex , hippocampus , thalamus , and amygdala , -LRB- 18 -RRB- F-fluorodeoxyglucose -LRB- FDG -RRB- - PET analysis of metabolic function , and behavioral analysis of cognitive and emotional changes , at 1 week , and 1 , 3 , and 6 months post-LFPI , all failed to identify significant differences on univariate analysis between the epileptic and nonepileptic groups .

23712665|The interplay of attention and emotion : top-down attention modulates amygdala activation in psychopathy . .

23712090|Results showed that cocaine users with comorbid personality disorders had reduced activation of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex during negative emotion maintenance and increased activation of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala during reappraisal .

23706702|Strabismus images led to significant activation of the amygdala , hippocampus , parahippocampal , and fusiform gyri in 30 of 31 subjects compared with normal eye images , indicating a negative emotional response .

23705819|Thus we show the effect of exposure to fear on visual perception is not a general emotional effect , but rather one that may that depend on amygdala activation , or one that may be specific to fear .

23700105|The occipito-temporal cortex and the amygdala-hippocampal complex showed a non-specific emotion-related activation , which was more marked in response to negative emotions than to happiness .

23699508|The amygdala becomes overresponsive to emotional stimuli , an effect that could be driven by local hypersensitivity or by reduced prefrontal regulation .

23699508|Increased amygdala activity in s-carriers originates from reduced prefrontal inhibitory regulation when social emotional behavior needs to be controlled , suggesting a mechanism for increased vulnerability to psychopathologies .

23696521|The amygdala , a heterogeneous structure that encodes emotional salience , projects to both the BSTL and ventral striatum .

23696058|At the same time , PFC activation is strongly influenced by emotional reactions through its functional interaction with the amygdala and the striatal circuitry , areas involved in emotion and reward processing .

23693086|Prenatal cocaine exposure -LRB- PCE -RRB- is associated with arousal dysregulation , and alterations of amygdala activity in response to emotional arousal have previously been reported .

23693086|Recent neuroimaging studies have shown the involvement of ventral prefrontal cortex -LRB- vPFC -RRB- in the modulation of amygdala reactivity and the mediation of effective emotional regulation .

23693086|In a working memory task with emotional distracters , the PCE adolescents exhibited less capability of increasing their vPFC activation in response to increased memory load , which corresponded with their less suppressed amygdala activation .

23693003|A positive family history of alcohol dependence has also been related to decreased amygdala responses during emotional processing .

23688672|It is widely accepted that the amygdala plays a crucial role in the processing of emotions .

23688672|We hypothesized that ambivalent findings from neuroimaging studies that report amygdala 's activity in emotions , are due to distinct functional specificity of amygdala 's sub-divisions and specifically to differential reactivity to arousal and valence .

23688672|Our hypothesis was prompted by recent reports claiming anatomical sub-divisions of amygdala based on cytoarchitecture and the functional maps obtained from diverse behavioral , emotional , and physiological stimulation .

23688672|To the best of our knowledge , our findings from non-invasive MEG data indicate for the first time , a distinct functional specificity of amygdala anatomical sub-divisions in the emotional processing .

23678588|Several important findings have been yielded : For instance , amygdala volume reduction was correlated with impaired facial emotion recognition ability , while reductions in the medial prefrontal cortex was correlated with impairment in emotion attribution to protagonists in social situations .

23672532|These results suggest that the ACC and amygdala/hippocampal regions are deficient in children with AS , likely contributing to difficulty with modulating of emotional reactivity .

23669637|Depression is a mental disorder characterized by emotional and cognitive dysfunction , which is related to the abnormal activity in brain regions involving emotion processing such as amygdala -LRB- AMYG -RRB- .

23668221|In a patient with a lesion of the right amygdala and temporal pole who had the characteristics of the gourmand syndrome , sensory and hedonic testing was performed to examine the processing of taste , olfactory , and some emotional stimuli .

23664811|These tools not only are very helpful to unravel the role of Cx43 hemichannels in complex biological systems , but also hold therapeutic potential to counteract excessive Cx43-hemichannel activity like in ischemia/reperfusion in the brain and the heart or to prevent Cx43 hemichannel-mediated gliotransmitter release in the basal amygdala during memory consolidation in response to emotional events .

23657281|Although interactions between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- are critical for emotional guidance of behavior , the manner in which amygdala affects PFC function is not clear .

23653601|These findings suggest shared neural substrates for the influence of emotional salience on perceptual and mnemonic vividness , with amygdala and visual cortex activation at encoding contributing to the experience of both perception and subsequent memory .

23651691|One such candidate is the amygdalar complex , and specifically , the central nucleus -LRB- CeA -RRB- , which has been implicated in emotional arousal and is known to send monosynaptic afferent projections to both these regions .

23647533|EtOH challenge counteracted CB1R and CBR2 up-regulation , mainly in the EtOH_High , in structures related to emotionality , such as prefrontal cortex , ventral tegmental area , amygdala , striatum , and hippocampus .

23644586|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is responsible for associations of sensory stimuli with emotional valence and is thought to be involved in stress-induced responses .

23643995|Comparing our results with previous functional neuroimaging findings , increased activity of the amygdala and anterior insula and decreased activity of the thalamus are consistent patterns across emotion provocation states and the resting state .

23643103|The aim of the present study was to examine amygdala function and its connectivity with medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- during emotional face perception in PD and SP , and the role of illness severity .

23641742|The amygdala is the key brain structure for anxiety and emotional memory storage .

23638379|The pattern of brain activity during emotional processing allowed correct group classification with an overall accuracy of 77 % -LRB- p = 0.002 -RRB- , within a network of regions including the amygdala , insula , anterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex .

23636982|Functional brain activation to emotional and nonemotional faces in healthy children : evidence for developmentally undifferentiated amygdala function during the school-age period . .

23636982|The amygdala is a key region in emotion processing .

23636982|In particular , fMRI studies have demonstrated that the amygdala is active during the viewing of emotional faces .

23636982|Studies have shown that the amygdala also responds differentially to other facial emotion types in adults .

23636982|Thus , the goal of the present study was to examine amygdala responses to emotional and neutral faces in a relatively large sample of healthy school-age children -LRB- N = 52 -RRB- .

23636982|Although the amygdala was active in response to emotional and neutral faces , the results did not support the hypothesis that the amygdala responds differentially to emotional faces in 7 - to 12-year-old children .

23636982|Nonetheless , amygdala activity was correlated with the severity of subclinical depression symptoms and with emotional regulation skills .

23636466|The medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mpFC -RRB- and amygdala are acknowledged as having a major role in stress-related behaviors , and mpFC has a critical role in the regulation of amygdala-mediated arousal in response to emotionally salient stimuli .

23635407|This emotional enhancement of memory may be related to the attentional effects of the amygdala 's response to emotional stimuli .

23635407|The goal of our study was to evaluate the effects of emotion on picture recognition in patients affected by Alzheimer 's disease , and to explore the link between this effect and the degree of amygdalar and hippocampal atrophy .

23635407|Conversely , no emotional effect on memory was found across the group of patients ; however , significant correlations were found between the loss of this effect and amygdalar and hippocampal volumes .

23624153|Prefrontal cortex and amygdala are key regions in the neural circuitry underlying fear conditioning and extinction , which thus has emerged as a useful model of stress influences on the neural circuitry underlying regulation of emotional behavior .

23616559|Fragile X syndrome -LRB- FXS -RRB- is a debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder thought to arise from disrupted synaptic communication in several key brain regions , including the amygdala , a central processing center for information with emotional and social relevance .

23616532|Thus , our findings suggest that the growing dominance of amygdalar activity over the hippocampus during and even after chronic stress may contribute to the enhanced emotional symptoms , alongside impaired cognitive function , seen in stress-related psychiatric disorders .

23611537|As increased amygdala and striatal responses during the processing of reward and emotion are characteristic for bipolar disorder patients , it was tested whether the risk variant has an influence on this endophenotype in healthy adolescents .

23611537|Differential activation between carriers of the risk allele -LRB- G-allele -RRB- and homozygous A-allele carriers in the amygdala and the striatum during a modification of the monetary incentive delay task -LRB- examining reward -RRB- and a face task -LRB- examining emotion -RRB- was analyzed .

23597510|Here we ask : does the metaplastic effect of nicotine on cocaine also apply in the amygdala , a brain region that is involved in the orchestration of emotions and in drug addiction ?

23595737|Both visual observation and quantitative comparison of the anatomical connection patterns of the three FP subregions revealed that the FPo showed greater connection probabilities to brain regions of the social emotion network -LRB- SEN -RRB- , including the orbitofrontal cortex , temporal pole , and amygdala , the FPl showed stronger connections to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of the cognitive processing network -LRB- CPN -RRB- , and the FPm showed stronger connections to brain areas of the default mode network -LRB- DMN -RRB- , including the anterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex .

23593185|Moreover , men revealed heightened activation of the right amygdala to male stimuli regardless of condition -LRB- sex vs. emotion recognition -RRB- .

23591691|The amygdaloid complex and hippocampal region contribute to emotional activities , learning , and memory .

23590840|Neural activity and functional connectivity analyses focused on a priori neural regions supporting emotion processing -LRB- amygdala and ventral striatum -RRB- and voluntary emotion regulation -LRB- ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- VLPFC -RRB- , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- , and anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- -RRB- .

23590840|Relative to HC , HBO exhibited greater right VLPFC -LRB- BA47 -RRB- activation in response to positive emotional distracters and reduced VLPFC modulation of the amygdala to both the positive and negative emotional distracters ; there were no group differences in connectivity for the neutral distracters .

23588198|Our goal was to study whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor -LRB- BDNF -RRB- and glial-derived neurotrophic factor -LRB- GDNF -RRB- expression were affected by alcohol in central extended amygdala -LRB- CEXA -RRB- and pyriform cortex -LRB- Pyr -RRB- , structures strongly involved in emotional/social behaviors .

23584670|These preliminary findings suggest that alcohol 's effects on social behavior may be mediated by alternations in functional connectivity between the amygdala and OFC during processing of emotional faces .

23583499|A functional deletion variant of the ADRA2B gene encoding the ?2B-adrenergic receptor has been shown to increase emotional memory and neural activity in the amygdala .

23576070|These opposing behavioral responses , together with distinct patterns of brain activation , particularly the bidirectional tonic activation or deactivation of the amygdala elicited by 22-kHz and 50-kHz USV , respectively , concur with a wealth of behavioral and neuroimaging studies in humans involving emotionally salient stimuli , such as fearful and happy facial expressions .

23570794|The amygdaloid complex , or amygdala , has been implicated in assigning emotional significance to sensory information and producing appropriate behavioral responses to external stimuli .

23570794|The lateral and basal nuclei -LRB- lateral and basal amygdala -RRB- , which are termed together as basolateral amygdala , play a critical role in emotional and motivational learning and memory .

23570794|These findings raise the possibility that the lateral and basal amygdala differentially modulate memory processes in the hippocampus under emotional and motivational situations .

23565082|Instead , physiological studies and network simulations suggest that top-down signals from prefrontal cortex realize '' cognitive control '' in part by either suppressing or promoting emotional responses controlled by the amygdala , in a way that facilitates adaptation to changing task demands .

23563850|Neurobiological mechanisms of actively induced emotion regulation are associated with prefrontally mediated down-regulation of , for instance , the amygdala .

23563850|During the perception of negative stimuli , reduced activation was identified in regions involved in emotion processing -LRB- amygdala , parahippocampal gyrus -RRB- .

23547713|Generalized social anxiety disorder -LRB- gSAD -RRB- is associated with a heightened neural sensitivity to signals that convey threat , as evidenced by exaggerated amygdala and/or insula activation when processing face stimuli that express negative emotions .

23547713|This study evaluated amygdala , insula , and anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- activity in gSAD with a novel '' Emotional Faces Shifting Attention Task '' -LRB- EFSAT -RRB- , an adaptation of perceptual assessment tasks well-known to elicit amygdala response .

23547713|In healthy volunteers , the task has been shown to engage the amygdala when attention is directed to emotional faces and the ACC when attention is directed to shapes , away from emotional faces .

23547713|Participants with gSAD exhibited greater insula , but not amygdala , activation compared to controls when attending to emotional faces .

23543193|Distinctive amygdala subregions involved in emotion-modulated Stroop interference . .

23543193|Despite the well-known role of the amygdala in mediating emotional interference during tasks requiring cognitive resources , no definite conclusion has yet been reached regarding the differential roles of functionally and anatomically distinctive subcomponents of the amygdala in such processes .

23543193|Reaction time data showed a significantly increased Stroop interference effect following emotionally negative stimuli compared with neutral stimuli , and functional magnetic resonance imaging data revealed that the anterior ventral amygdala -LRB- avAMYG -RRB- showed greater responses to negative stimuli compared with neutral stimuli .

23539535|Recently , the relationships of pain and emotion were studied , and electrical stimulation applied to the amygdala depressed the nociceptive response in the anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- .

23538069|Affective disorders are believed to involve dysfunction within the amygdala , a key structure for processing emotional information .

23537323|This review of neuroimaging studies on alexithymia suggests that alexithymia is associated with reduced neural responses to emotional stimuli from the external environment , as well as with reduced activity during imagery , in the limbic and paralimbic areas -LRB- i.e. , amygdala , insula , anterior/posterior cingulate cortex -RRB- .

23536785|It is thought to be characterized by an exaggerated amygdalar and decreased medial prefrontal activation to which the elevated anxiety state and concomitant inadequate emotional regulation are attributed .

23531435|We hypothesized that Prkar1a -LRB- + / - -RRB- mice would exhibit a bias in threat detection since increased amygdala activity during emotional stimuli is associated with a maladaptive response .

23530897|That is , memory positivity in older adults was associated with -LRB- a -RRB- enhanced MPFC activity when learning emotional faces and -LRB- b -RRB- increased negative functional coupling between amygdala and MPFC when learning negative faces .

23529193|Specifically , the amygdalar connections of area 45A , for which a role in communication behavior has been proposed , could convey information on the emotional significance of communicative signals to this area , where it could play a crucial role in guiding appropriate social interactions .

23526601|The scientific investigation of empathy has focused on characterizing its cognitive and neural substrates , and has pointed to the importance of a network of brain regions involved in emotional experience and perspective taking -LRB- e.g. , ventromedial prefrontal cortex , amygdala , anterior insula , cingulate -RRB- .

23518269|A volitional system involving frontoparietal -LRB- primary motor , premotor , supplementary motor , posterior insular , dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus -LRB- ACG -RRB- , primary sensory and related parietal -RRB- corticopontine projections inhibits an emotionally-controlled system involving frontotemporal -LRB- orbitofrontal , ventral ACG , anterior insular , inferior temporal , and parahippocampal -RRB- projections targeting the amygdala-hypothalamus-periaqueductal gray -LRB- PAG -RRB- - dorsal tegmentum -LRB- dTg -RRB- complex that regulates emotional displays .

23517886|At baseline , in response to emotional vs. neutral words , patients with PBD showed greater activation than HC in the right dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- and amygdala , ventral lateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- VLPFC -RRB- , bilateral anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , and ventral striatum .

23515889|In addition , strong and discrete expression of their receptors in the extended amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis suggests a potential role in regulating stress responses , emotion , anxiety , and fear .

23515155|The extended amygdala , including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- , modulates fear and anxiety , but also projects to the ventral tegmental area -LRB- VTA -RRB- , a region implicated in reward and aversion , thus providing a candidate neural substrate for integrating diverse emotional states .

23501048|With ROI-based analysis , there was a small effect of the challenge related to emotional processing in the amygdala , but this effect could not be reproduced between sessions .

23499791|The novelty of our results lies in the demonstration of gene by sex interaction with resting blood flow in the amygdala that elucidates sex-related differences in emotional reactivity .

23499314|In summary , repeated morphine administration in neonatal rats -LRB- PD1-7 -RRB- is associated with increased supraspinal apoptosis in distinct anatomical regions known to be important for sensory -LRB- cortex -RRB- and emotional memory processing -LRB- amygdala -RRB- .

23495221|These findings held for all levels of anxiety , suggesting that within the context of the fear-potentiated startle paradigm , amygdala response is not associated with degree of atypical social or emotional functioning in ASD .

23494464|The amygdala is a core component of neural circuits that mediate processing of emotional , particularly anxiety and fear-related stimuli across species .

23494234|The nucleus accumbens -LRB- NAc -RRB- and amygdala have been implicated in the consolidation and reconsolidation of emotional memories .

23482625|Thus , the combined effect of carrying NPY risk genotype and a history of CEM affected amygdala and PCC reactivity , areas related to emotion , self-relevance processing and autobiographical memory .

23482620|Along with deficient recognition of negative emotions , patients exhibited predominantly lower neural response to stimuli of negative valences in the amygdala , hippocampus , striatum , insula , cingulate and prefrontal cortices , as well as in sensorimotor , temporal and visual areas .

23479459|Results showed that , similarly to IAPS pictures , brands activated a well-defined emotional network , including amygdala and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , highly specific of affective valence .

23467374|Although tracing studies have suggested changes in amygdala-cortical connectivity through the adolescent period in rodents , less is known about the reciprocal connections within this circuitry across human development , when these circuits are being fine-tuned and substantial changes in emotional control are observed .

23467364|In addition , we also found a functional link between this enhanced RPE signal and increased activity in the amygdala following presentation of an emotional face .

23459637|Patients , but not controls , showed an atypical response pattern of the right amygdala with increased activation during emotional interference in the -LRB- difficult -RRB- incongruent flanker condition , but emotion-related amygdala deactivation in the congruent condition .

23453566|The cortico-limbic-striatal neural system , including the prefrontal cortex , amygdala , hippocampus , and striatum , have shown sexually dimorphic morphological features and have been implicated in the dysfunctional regulation of mood and emotion in MDD .

23452685|These findings suggest that adolescents with GAD manifest alterations in amygdala circuits involved in emotion processing , similar to findings in adults .

23448192|Using functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- , we examined behavioral and brain responses in a priori emotion generative regions of interest -LRB- amygdala and insula -RRB- in 67 patients with generalized SAD and in 28 healthy controls -LRB- HC -RRB- during three distinct socio-emotional tasks .

23448192|The similar responses in amygdala and insula in SAD and HC participants suggest that heightened negative emotion responses reported by patients with SAD may be related to dysfunction in higher cognitive processes -LRB- e.g. , distorted appraisal , attention biases , or ineffective cognitive reappraisal -RRB- .

23440757|It also explains how musical emotion processing activates auditory cortex , as well as a series of limbic and paralimbic structures , such as the amygdala , the anterior cingulate cortex or the hippocampus , demonstrating the relevant contribution of the limbic system to musical emotion .

23439935|Most of these studies focused on functional changes in the amygdala and anterior corticolimbic brain circuits that control cognitive , motivational , and emotional aspects of physiology and behavior .

23438699|The activity of the amygdala is modulated by various factors , like stimulus type and origin , emotion triggered by stimulus perception , and attention .

23438699|The neural network comprising the amygdala and the frontal cortex is involved not only in top-down inhibition , but also in the emotional perception of facial expressions .

23438699|This network also includes the thalamic pulvinar , which is densely interconnected with the amygdala , directly or indirectly , and which is activated by emotional face recognition of scary fear .

23438699|Both top-down inhibition mechanisms and emotional face recognition are altered in anxiety disorders , particularly in specific and social phobia , resulting in reduced amygdalar activity inhibition after anxiety - or fear - inducing stimulus perception .

23437284|These results indicate that CACNA1C SNP rs1006737 affects amygdala activity during emotional processing across all diagnostic groups .

23427353|We found that such labels biased food evaluations in the amygdala , a core emotional brain system .

23426691|In rats , the consolidation of inhibitory avoidance -LRB- IA -RRB- memory requires gene expression in both the hippocampus and amygdala , two brain regions that process contextual/spatial and emotional information , respectively ; IA reconsolidation requires de novo gene expression in the amygdala .

23395233|F-MRI studies show that healthy participants present increase activation of some structures such as amygdala involved in emotion processing .

23395233|Furthermore , an f-MRI study shows that mood stabilizers can reduce amygdala activation of bipolar patients compared to untreated bipolar patients during an emotional task .

23418609|Our results suggest that these mechanisms could be involved in the connection of emotional and contextual information processed in the amygdala and dorsal hippocampus , respectively , thus opening new venues for the development of treatments to psychopathological alterations linked to impaired contextualization of emotions .

23418586|Sleep debt elicits negative emotional reaction through diminished amygdala-anterior cingulate functional connectivity . .

23418586|The results of this study suggest that continuous and accumulating sleep debt that can be experienced in everyday life can downregulate the functional suppression of the amygdala by the vACC and consequently enhance the response of the amygdala to negative emotional stimuli .

23410057|The amygdala , a brain center for emotions , is a major site of extrahypothalamic expression of CRF and its G-protein-coupled receptors .

23408565|Resolving emotional conflict : A role for the rostral anterior cingulate cortex in modulating activity in the amygdala .

23394774|Physiological basis for emotional modulation of memory circuits by the amygdala . .

23394774|Here , we summarize new developments in our understanding of how the amygdala facilitates the formation of emotional memories .

23394774|This approach has revealed that in emotionally arousing conditions , whether positively or negatively valenced , the amygdala allows incoming information to be processed more efficiently in distributed cerebral networks .

23394712|A between-groups comparison revealed hypoactivation in MDD during emotional task in areas supporting conflict resolution -LRB- lateral prefrontal cortex , parietal and extrastriate cortices -RRB- paralleled by increased response in the right amygdala .

23386739|Behavioral hypotheses point toward an association between emotion recognition deficits in psychopathy and amygdala dysfunction .

23386739|Our results suggest that emotional stimulation may evoke a relevant cortical response in psychopaths , but a disruption in the processing of emotional faces exists involving the reciprocal functional interaction between the amygdala and neocortex , consistent with the notion of a failure to integrate emotion into cognition in psychopathic individuals .

23383244|Pro homozygotes showed a performance advantage at the behavioral level and exhibited enhanced activation of the amygdala and fusiform face area during working memory for emotional faces .

23382516|Aside the DLPFC , results suggest the right amygdala to play a role in attention control mechanisms related to the processing of emotional cues .

23380162|Sex-dependent role of the amygdala in the development of emotional and neuroendocrine reactivity to threatening stimuli in infant and juvenile rhesus monkeys . .

23380162|Yet , little is known about the exact role the amygdala plays in the development of threat detection and emotional modulation .

23380162|The current study examined the effects of neonatal amygdala lesions on defensive , emotional , and neuroendocrine reactivity of infant rhesus monkeys reared with their mothers in large species-typical social groups .

23380162|These data indicate that the amygdala plays a critical role in the development of both emotional and neuroendocrine reactivity as well as the expression of sexually dimorphic emotional expression .

23377287|We also document normal activity of the amygdala -LRB- emotion processing -RRB- as well as normal or even enhanced functional connectivity between the amygdala and the core regions .

23377126|Neuroscientists have long appreciated that the amygdala mediates spatially nonspecific emotional responses , but it remains unclear whether the amygdala links motivational and spatial representations .

23377126|These results suggest that amygdala dysfunction may contribute to deficits in cognitive processes normally coordinated with emotional responses , such as the directing of attention toward the location of emotionally relevant stimuli .

23376311|In young adult mice , we studied the effects of behaviorally ineffective -LRB- saporin-induced -RRB- SHC lesions - similar in extent to that seen in aged animals - on activity patterns and functional connectivity between three main neural memory systems : the septo-hippocampal system , the striatum and the amygdala that sustain declarative , procedural and emotional memory , respectively .

23371914|Interestingly , lithium appears to preserve or increase the volume of brain structures involved in emotional regulation such as the prefrontal cortex , hippocampus and amygdala , possibly reflecting its neuroprotective effects .

23364872|As recently shown in healthy volunteers , dopamine storage capacity -LRB- V d -RRB- in the left amygdala was positively correlated with functional activation in the left amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- during an emotional task ; high functional connectivity between the amygdala and the ACC , a region important for emotion regulation , was associated with low trait anxiety .

23364872|Moreover , the functional connectivity between amygdala and ACC during processing of aversive emotional stimuli was reduced in patients .

23364872|Voxel-based morphometry did not reveal any discernible group differences in amygdala volume.These results suggest that dopamine-modulated corticolimbic circuit function is important for responding to emotional information such that apparent functional deficits in this neuromodulatory circuitry may contribute to trait anxiety in alcohol-dependent patients .

23352275|Investigations into the specific association of amygdala volume , a critical aspect of the fronto-limbic emotional circuitry , and aggression have produced results broadly consistent with the ` larger is more powerful ' doctrine .

23346054|A distinction between emotional -LRB- vs. neutral -RRB- and social -LRB- vs. non-social -RRB- relevance is supported by previous studies showing that the human amygdala preferentially responds to both emotionally and socially significant information , and these factors might even display interactive encoding properties .

23345231|In this study of the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , which is critical in emotional learning of drug reward , we investigated how adaptive changes in the expression of GluA1 subunits affected the learning process of opioid-induced context-reward association -LRB- associative learning -RRB- for the acquisition of reward-related behavior .

23337458|These effects have been attributed to enhanced neural responses of sensory regions to emotional stimuli , presumably driven by feedback signals from limbic regions such as the amygdala .

23335892|The most significant areas of activation during emotional vs. neutral stimuli in individuals with SAD compared to controls were : bilateral amygdala , left medial temporal lobe encompassing the entorhinal cortex , left medial aspect of the inferior temporal lobe encompassing perirhinal cortex and parahippocampus , right anterior cingulate , right globus pallidus , and distal tip of right postcentral gyrus .

23326662|We examined functional connectivity of the amygdala in preadolescent children with Autism Spectrum Disorders -LRB- ASDs -RRB- during spontaneous attention to eye-gaze in emotional faces .

23326662|In control children , the amygdala was more strongly connected with an emotional cognitive control region -LRB- subgenual cingulate -RRB- during interference , while during facilitation , no regions showed greater amygdala connectivity than in ASD children .

23319313|Our findings demonstrated that in Chinese Han participants , in contrast to Caucasians , the L-allele confers vulnerability to anxiety or depression and weakens top-down emotional control between the PFC and amygdala .

23318227|For historical and methodological reasons , models describing the brain architecture that supports emotional processes in humans have tended to neglect the basal ganglia , focusing instead on cortical and amygdalar mechanisms .

23317795|Interestingly , we observed significant activation of affect-related brain areas -LRB- ventromedial prefrontal cortex , amygdala , and insula -RRB- , thought to be implicated in various aspects of emotion regulation during the observation of risk-taking actions .

23313581|Vasopressin modulates neural responses related to emotional stimuli in the right amygdala . .

23313581|Vasopressin modulated the activation of the right amygdala related to the emotional component of empathy .

23313419|Evidence for a cerebral cortical thickness network anti-correlated with amygdalar volume in healthy youths : implications for the neural substrates of emotion regulation . .

23313419|Similarly , in human neuroimaging studies , aspects of emotion regulation have been associated with increased activity in dorsolateral , dorsomedial , orbital and ventromedial prefrontal regions , as well as concomitant decreases in amygdalar activity .

23313419|Specifically , we hypothesized that amygdalar volume would be related to cerebral cortical thickness in cortical regions implicated in aspects of emotion regulation .

23305653|These findings provide the first evidence of an abnormality in white matter microstructure that involves the amygdala and the cingulate cortex in the pathogenesis of GAD , and are consistent with neurobiological models that posit a defect in emotion-related brain regions .

23303950|Recent electrophysiological studies on the primate amygdala have advanced our understanding of how individual neurons encode information relevant to emotional processes , but it remains unclear how these neurons are functionally and anatomically organized .

23303950|Furthermore , we report that responses to sensory stimuli are prevalent in the lateral amygdala , and are also prevalent in the medial amygdala for sensory stimuli that are emotionally significant .

23303950|The circuits identified here could potentially mediate valence-specific emotional behaviors thought to involve the amygdala .

23302233|Many studies have reported reduced activation in limbic areas -LRB- e.g. , cingulate cortex , anterior insula , amygdala -RRB- and the prefrontal cortex when alexithymics attempt to feel other people 's feelings or retrieve their own emotional episodes , compared to nonalexithymics .

23294552|Recent work has explored a number of interesting topics including the dissociation of emotional experience from memory in patients with amnesia , the reliability of specific emotional deficits following focal brain damage -LRB- including fear and the amygdala -RRB- , and the investigation of compensatory neural mechanisms in lesion patients .

23282205|Involvement of amygdaloid protein synthesis in early - and late-phase reconsolidation of emotion-related memories . .

23282205|This study was undertaken to test whether de novo protein synthesis in the basolateral -LRB- BLA -RRB- and central -LRB- CeA -RRB- nucleus of amygdala was required for reconsolidation of emotion-related memories .

23282205|These results , taken together , imply that de novo protein synthesis in amygdala plays an important role in modulating reconsolidation of emotion-related memory .

23279689|Patients with amygdala lesions were found to be impaired in recognizing the fear emotion both from face and from music .

25408902|The amygdala is a structure of the temporal lobe thought to be involved in assigning emotional significance to environmental information and triggering adapted physiological , behavioral and affective responses .

25408902|Pain having a strong affective and emotional dimension , the amygdala , especially its central nucleus -LRB- CeA -RRB- , has also emerged in the last twenty years as key element of the pain matrix .

25225017|The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex was activated in concert with the amygdala , both in PTSD and in phobic states , suggesting a role in fear expression , rather than emotional control .

23266792|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- modulates memory , particularly for arousing or emotional events , during post-training periods of consolidation .

23261134|In response to emotional faces , patients with adolescent bipolar disorder -LRB- ABD -RRB- exhibit increased neural activity in subcortical emotional processing regions -LRB- e.g. , amygdala , ventral striatum -RRB- and variable prefrontal activity .

23250006|More specifically , the prelimbic cortex -LRB- PL -RRB- of the mPFC is implicated in driving emotional responses via downstream targets including the nucleus accumbens and amygdala , but mechanisms are yet to be fully understood .

23248583|These regions are important for behavioral -LRB- processing of emotions and motivation -RRB- and functional -LRB- memory -RRB- performances of the amygdala as reported in other studies .

23243143|Facing the role of the amygdala in emotional information processing . .

23239022|Emotional processing differs between the left and right hemispheres of the brain , and functional differences have been reported more specifically between the left and right amygdalae , subcortical structures heavily implicated in emotional processing .

23239022|However , the empirical pattern of amygdalar asymmetries is inconsistent with extant theories of emotional asymmetries .

23228163|Emotion treatment and emotional regulation strategies are complex functions involving cortical and limbic structures , like the amygdala .

23228163|As the amygdala has been shown to play a role in facial emotion recognition , we tested the hypothesis that patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy would have impaired recognition of facial emotional expressions compared with patients affected with central hypersomnia without cataplexy and healthy controls .

23219471|In comparison with their pretreatment cycle , the COC group had decreased emotion-induced reactivity in the bilateral inferior frontal gyri , whereas placebo users had decreased reactivity in the right amygdala .

23213218|In contrast , the amygdala was only sensitive to changes in expression that altered the perceived emotion , demonstrating a more categorical representation .

23209643|While several neuroimaging studies have linked SAD with hyperreactivity in limbic brain regions when exposed to emotional faces , little is known about habituation in both the amygdala and neocortical regulation areas .

23209643|In both groups , the employed paradigm robustly activated the emotion processing and regulation network , including the amygdalae and orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- .

23148887|Although neonatal amygdala lesions did not impair the ability to exhibit defensive and emotional behaviors , it altered the modulation of these responses based on the intruder 's gaze direction .

23148887|The changes in emotional reactivity after neonatal amygdala lesions emerged in infancy and persisted throughout adulthood when they were associated with a reduction of basal cortisol levels and a blunted cortisol response to the stressor .

23125828|The amygdala has been repeatedly implicated in emotional processing of both positive and negative-valence stimuli .

23125828|Previous studies suggest that the amygdala response to emotional stimuli is lower when the subject is in a meditative state of mindful-attention , both in beginner meditators after an 8-week meditation intervention and in expert meditators .

23103792|The basolateral nuclear complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLC -RRB- receives dense noradrenergic/norepinephrine -LRB- NE -RRB- inputs from the locus coeruleus that play a key role in modulating emotional memory consolidation .

23103773|Since cGKII is expressed in the striatum , amygdala , cerebral cortex , and hippocampus , it has been proposed that mice lacking cGKII may present phenotypic differences compared to their wild-type littermates in emotion-dependent tasks , learning and memory , and drug reward salience .

23096764|However , we hypothesize major differences in emotional empathy deficits between ASD and CD , probably due to emotional autonomic and amygdala hyper-responsivity in ASD versus hypo-responsivity in CD , both resulting in lack of attention to the eyes .

23096238|These two bombesin receptors are members of the G-protein-coupled receptor -LRB- GPCR -RRB- superfamily.In the brain , NMBR and GRPR are highly expressed in the brain areas involved in memory processing and emotional responses , such as the hippocampus and the amygdaloid nuclei .

23096238|An increasing number of pharmacological and genetic studies in rodents indicate that NMBRs and GRPRs in brain regions including the dorsal hippocampus , the nucleus tractus solitarius , the basolateral amygdala , and cortical areas , regulate memory formation and expression , particularly for memories related to emotionally arousing tasks .

23074247|The neuropeptide oxytocin -LRB- OXT -RRB- can enhance the impact of positive social cues but may reduce that of negative ones by inhibiting amygdala activation , although it is unclear whether the latter causes blunted emotional and mnemonic responses .

23074247|Our results therefore show that OXT can potentiate the protective and mnemonic impact of aversive social information despite reducing amygdala activity , and suggest that the insula may play a role in emotional modulation of memory .

23071554|Finally , we investigated a possible interaction between ghrelin 's effects on feeding control and emotional reactivity exerted at the level of the amygdala .

23071554|Collectively , these data indicate that the amygdala is a valid target brain area for ghrelin where its neurobiological effects are important for food intake and for the suppression of emotional -LRB- anxiety-like -RRB- behaviors if food is not available .

23060828|Overall , our results suggest that the impact of emotional distracters on the neural response in cognitive-control regions as well as in the amygdala is modulated by task difficulty , and add to our understanding of the factors that determine whether emotion enhances or impairs cognition .

23055488|These results support a complex -LRB- recurrent -RRB- interaction between the auditory cortex and amygdala based on object-level analysis in the auditory cortex that portends the assignment of emotional valence in amygdala that in turn influences the representation of salient information in auditory cortex .

23049502|Results showed that a direct relationship between emotional distraction and memory was dependent on automatic mechanisms , as this was found only under conditions of limited resource availability and engagement of amygdala -LRB- AMY -RRB- - hippocampal -LRB- HC -RRB- mechanisms to both impairing and enhancing effects .

23035965|Within a network for '' affect evaluation and regulation , '' PBD showed decreased functional connectivity relative to HC in regions involved in emotion processing such as the right amygdala , and in emotion regulation regions such as the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- VLPFC -RRB- , while functional connectivity was increased in emotion evaluation regions such as the bilateral medial PFC. Furthermore , in an '' Affective Working Memory Network , '' PBD exhibited greater connectivity relative to HC in left dorsolateral PFC -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- , caudate , and right VLPFC ; and simultaneously reduced connectivity in emotion processing regions , such as the right amygdala , bilateral temporal regions , and the junction of DLPFC/VLPFC , which interfaces affective and cognitive processes .

23034517|We hypothesized that healthy adolescents at increased genetic and environmental risk for developing mood disorders -LRB- depression and anxiety -RRB- would demonstrate increased amygdala reactivity to emotional stimuli compared to those with only one such risk factor or those with none .

23033120|To conclude , semantic processing deficits in depression are modulated by emotional valence of the stimulus on the behavioral as well as on neural level in right-lateralized prefrontal areas and the amygdala .

23026956|High compared with low hypnotizable individuals had greater functional connectivity between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , an executive-control region of the brain , and the salience network composed of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex , anterior insula , amygdala , and ventral striatum , involved in detecting , integrating , and filtering relevant somatic , autonomic , and emotional information using independent component analysis .

23023031|Via genomic mechanisms , corticosteroid actions in the basolateral amygdala and ventral-most part of the cornu ammonis 1 hippocampal area are generally excitatory , providing an extended window for encoding of emotional aspects of a stressful event .

23015239|In AD , the early impairment of amygdala structures , whose central role in the recognition and memorisation of emotions has previously been demonstrated , has led researchers to focus on the possible implications of such impairment in generating cognitive disturbances or behavioural troubles in these subjects .

23001314|Thus , under robust emotional arousal , amygdala activation can modulate the relative use of memory systems in a manner that favors habit memory .

23000628|Interestingly , in long-term survival experiments , sex differences were preserved in the long-lasting BrdU cells within the telencephalic Dm -LRB- homologous to mammalian amygdala -RRB- , and the diencephalic PPv , areas that have a role in emotional behavior and endocrine regulation .

22985193|The amygdala is an essential neural substrate for associative learning of emotion .

22984504|However , compared to low PC participants , those who scored high on PC showed differential activation in a network of regions associated with emotion reactivity and regulation , including increased amygdala activity and decreased reactions in prefrontal regulatory regions when they heard criticism .

22984177|Perception of threatening faces activated circuitry including amygdalar , thalamic , and brainstem regions , known in humans and other vertebrates to be related to emotion , motivation , and conditioned fear learning .

22981942|Since oxytocin is considered a key regulator of emotional and social reward that enhances amygdala-dependent , socially reinforced learning and emotional empathy , mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine neurons play a key role in motivation and reward , and yawning in mammals is considered a primitive , unconscious form of empathy , the present results support the hypothesis that oxytocinergic neurons originating in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and projecting to the above brain areas and mesolimbic and mesocortical dopaminergic neurons participate in the complex neural circuits that play a role in the above mentioned functions .

22938844|Bilateral superficial -LRB- SF -RRB- complex and the right laterobasal -LRB- LB -RRB- complex of the amygdala were generally sensitive to emotional cues from speech prosody .

22813951|While the literature suggests that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- , striatum , and amygdala are involved in valuation-based DM and hippocampus in context processing , how these neural mechanisms subserve the integration of cognitive and emotional values in a social context remains unclear .

22813951|Specifically , while the vmPFC , amygdala , and ventral striatum were all involved in both cognitive and emotional domains of valuation , these regions played dissociable roles in social DM .

22813951|The extent to which emotional input influenced choices was associated with the functional connectivity between the value-signaling amygdala and value integrating vmPFC , and also with the functional connectivity between the context-setting hippocampus and value-signaling amygdala and ventral striatum .

22764353|Furthermore , schizophrenic patients show malfunctions in distributed neural regions , ranging from the fusiform gyrus recruited in the structural encoding of facial stimuli , to the amygdala which plays a primary role in the detection of the emotional significance of stimuli .

22751491|Strongest reductions were found in regions consistently reported to be altered in major depression and involved in emotion regulation , such as the subgenual part of the anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- -27.5 % -RRB- , the orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- -30.1 % -RRB- , the amygdala -LRB- -31.8 % -RRB- , the hippocampus -LRB- -30.6 % -RRB- and the insula -LRB- -28.9 % -RRB- .

22748315|Nonconscious -LSB- 1-6 -RSB- , rapid -LSB- 7 , 8 -RSB- , or coarse -LSB- 9 -RSB- visual processing of emotional stimuli induces functional activity in a subcortical pathway to the amygdala involving the superior colliculus and pulvinar .

22737116|Alternatively , it is proposed that schizophrenia arises from a uniquely human brain network associated with directed effort including the dorsal anterior and posterior cingulate cortex -LRB- PCC -RRB- , auditory cortex , and hippocampus while mood disorders arise from a different brain network associated with emotional encoding including the ventral anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , orbital frontal cortex , and amygdala .

22729811|These results suggest that recovery from AN is not achieved by dampening an amygdala mediated emotional response to bodies , but instead by developing compensatory neural mechanisms that prevent emotional responses from disturbing cognition .

22728112|While the amygdalar role in fear conditioning is well established , it also appears to be involved in a wide spectrum of other functions concerning emotional information .

22728112|For example , the amygdala is thought to be involved in guiding spatial attention to emotionally relevant information such as the eye region in faces , and it gets activated differentially during different tasks .

22726836|Neuronal synchrony in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is critical for emotional behavior .

22723701|Extensive evidence implicates the amygdala as a major station for acquisition , extinction , and consolidation of emotional memories .

22716999|Our results suggest that short-term SSRI treatment in depressed patients remediates amygdala hyperactivity in response to negative emotional stimuli prior to clinical improvement in depressed mood .

22715374|Consistent with this , recent fMRI studies suggest that working memory performance depends upon the capacity of prefrontal cortex to suppress bottom-up amygdala signals during emotional arousal .

22714586|The current manuscript examines the non-human and human literatures on amygdala development following caregiver deprivation and presents an argument that in the absence of the species-expected caregiver presence , human amygdala development exhibits rapid development and perhaps premature engagement that results in some of the emotional phenotypes observed following early institutional care .

22703618|Functional magnetic resonance -LRB- fMRI -RRB- imaging was used to measure amygdala activation in an emotional valence discrimination task in clinically stable patients with schizophrenia treated with atypical antipsychotics and healthy controls .

22696400|Childhood maltreatment is associated with an automatic negative emotion processing bias in the amygdala . .

22696400|Major depression has been repeatedly associated with amygdala hyper-responsiveness to negative -LRB- but not positive -RRB- facial expressions at early , automatic stages of emotion processing using subliminally presented stimuli .

22696400|Because childhood maltreatment is a potent risk factor for the development of major depression in later life , we explored whether childhood maltreatment is associated with amygdalar emotion processing bias in maltreated but healthy subjects .

22696400|Childhood maltreatment is apparently associated with detectable changes in amygdala function during early stages of emotion processing which resemble findings described in major depression .

22691615|Persistent affective biases in human amygdala response following implicit priming with negative emotion concepts . .

22691615|We found that priming with emotional words enhanced amygdala sensitivity to faces in the subsequent visual task , while decreasing discriminative responses to threat .

22682158|However , neuroimaging studies have not so far revealed consistent evidence of abnormal responses to emotional stimuli in limbic structures , such as the amygdala , in remitted depression .

22672618|The amygdala plays an essential role in controlling emotional behaviors and has numerous connections to other brain regions .

22668857|Slow breathing synchronized with odor-induced autobiographical memory and emotions may be subconsciously stored in the parahippocampal cortex and amygdala .

22668856|Therefore , in the present study we investigated the effects of prenatal treatment with the glucocorticoid receptor agonist dexamethasone -LRB- DEX -RRB- on expression of calbindin and calretinin in brain areas critical to emotional regulation -LRB- basolateral/lateral amygdala and hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions -RRB- .

22668856|Together these findings indicate that late gestational DEX treatment causes a targeted reduction of calretinin within the lateral amygdala of females and this may be one mechanism through which developmental glucocorticoid exposure contributes to lasting alterations in emotional behavior .

22668847|To determine the relationships between this kind of vocal behaviour and emotion , we examined the lesion effects of the amygdala , an important neural module in emotional behaviour , on USVs .

22668847|However , we can hypothesize another scenario for the alterations to vocal behaviour : effects on the direct amygdala-periaqueductal grey -LRB- PAG -RRB- projection might be involved in the increase in the appearance rate of shorter syllables owing to lesion-induced loss of emotions , such as vigilance .

22659393|Several neuroimaging studies underlined the importance of the amygdala and prefrontal brain structures -LRB- e.g. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LSB- DLPFC -RSB- -RRB- for the processing of emotional stimuli and for emotion regulation .

22647521|However , the effects of OXT on connectivity of the amygdala with cortical regions such as medial frontal cortex , an important mediator of social cognition and emotion regulation , remain unexplored .

22647521|These results demonstrate that OXT is a robust and highly selective enhancer of amygdala connectivity with rmFC , a region critical to social cognition and emotion regulation , and add to our understanding of the neural mechanisms by which OXT modulates complex social and cognitive behaviours .

22642884|Fear conditioning studies have demonstrated the critical role played by the amygdala in emotion processing .

22642400|Culture but not gender modulates amygdala activation during explicit emotion recognition . .

22642400|Mounting evidence indicates that humans have significant difficulties in understanding emotional expressions from individuals of different ethnic backgrounds , leading to reduced recognition accuracy and stronger amygdala activation .

22642400|Analysis of functional data revealed bilateral amygdala activation to emotional expressions in Asian and European subjects .

22642400|This study has revealed bilateral amygdala activation to emotional expressions in Asian and European females and males .

22640663|In PD patients , voxel-based morphometry analysis revealed areas of positive correlation between individual emotion recognition and GM volume : in the right orbitofrontal cortex , amygdala and postcentral gyrus and sadness identification ; in the right occipital fusiform gyrus , ventral striatum and subgenual cortex and anger identification , and in the anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- and disgust identification .

22639242|Standard univariate fMRI analysis supports an interpretation , where this might be related to a higher responsiveness , by yielding a significant emotion × group interaction within the bilateral amygdala .

22634856|Individuals with greater ability to down-regulate negative emotion as indexed by corrugator at Session 1 showed not only greater amygdala attenuation but also greater inverse connectivity between the amygdala and several sectors of the prefrontal cortex while down-regulating negative emotion at Session 2 .

22634856|Our results demonstrate that individual differences in emotion regulation are stable over time and underscore the important role of amygdala-prefrontal coupling for successful regulation of negative emotion .

22631619|The literature is highly supportive of key roles for the amygdala , anterior paralimbic cortices , and connections among these structures in the emotional dysregulation of bipolar disorder .

22631618|A search was conducted on PubMed using the keywords : bipolar disorder , fMRI , mania , bipolar depression , bipolar euthymia , emotion , and amygdala .

22631618|Using a variety of paradigms , investigators have specifically evaluated the amygdala -LRB- a structure within the limbic system known to be critical for emotion -RRB- and the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- -LRB- a region known to have a regulatory function over the limbic system -RRB- .

22631617|Namely , disruption in early development -LRB- e.g. , white matter connectivity and prefrontal pruning -RRB- within brain networks that modulate emotional behavior leads to decreased connectivity among ventral prefrontal networks and limbic brain regions , especially the amygdala .

22626918|These data suggest that the amygdala is important in unconscious retrieving of memories for emotional faces whether they are encoded consciously or unconsciously .

22621263|Overall , our results indicate that the OFC is more activated by emotional than neutral reversal learning and that OFC 's interactions with the amygdala are greater for negative than neutral reversal learning .

22617672|A rapprochement between emotion and cognition : amygdala , emotion , and self-relevance in episodic-autobiographical memory . .

22617672|Lindquist et al. remark that not all fear instances lead to heightened amygdalar activity and , instead , point to roles of the amygdala in detecting '' motivationally salient '' or '' emotionally impactful '' stimuli .

22616722|Synaptic plasticity from amygdala to perirhinal cortex : a possible mechanism for emotional enhancement of visual recognition memory ? .

22616722|Several lines of evidence indicate that the amygdala plays an important role in this emotional enhancement of memory .

22616722|Knowing the mechanisms that control amygdala-perirhinal cortex interactions will allow better understanding of how emotionally charged visual events are remembered , and may help to understand how memories can consolidate and become intrusive in anxiety-related disorders .

22613776|Depressed patients showed a selective deficit in down-regulating amygdala responses to negative emotional stimuli using reappraisal .

22613736|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is strongly involved in emotional processing and expresses high levels of CCK .

22609571|The amygdala is implicated in chronic pain-induced emotional changes .

22592879|The amygdaloid complex represents a group of telencephalic nuclei and cortical areas that control emotional and social behavior .

22592057|Evidence of emotion-related disorder-specificity emerged in medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala .

22590628|Orexins have recently been hypothesized to modulate the extended amygdala and to contribute to the negative emotional state associated with dependence .

22585232|Our recent report that ? ? - tetrahydrocannabinol -LRB- THC -RRB- diminishes amygdalar activation in response to threat-related faces suggests that THC may modify evaluation of emotionally-salient , particularly negative or threatening , stimuli .

22580171|Positive and negative emotionally-charged images evoked significant increases in total SSNA and signal intensity in the orbital , dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortices , amygdala , nucleus accumbens and anterior insula .

22579645|The recognition of facial expressions of emotion is impaired in semantic dementia -LRB- SD -RRB- and is associated with right-sided brain atrophy in areas known to be involved in emotion processing , notably the amygdala .

22579645|Voxel-based morphometry showed that the labelling of emotions , regardless of modality , correlated with the degree of atrophy in the right temporal pole , amygdala and insula .

22575329|These two regions have been hypothesized to play different roles in stress and anxiety ; the amygdala is thought to regulate responses to brief emotional stimuli while the BNST is thought to be involved in more chronic regulation of sustained anxiety .

22575084|While current research perspectives on nicotine addiction emphasize the contribution of reward-related mesocorticolimbic dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- systems , the role of the amygdala remains less well characterized , although it is crucially engaged in the emotional and motivational modulation of cognition and behavior .

22574175|Prior research has shown that the amygdala of carriers of the short allele -LRB- s -RRB- of the serotonin transporter -LRB- 5-HTT -RRB- gene -LRB- 5-HTTLPR -RRB- have a larger response to negative emotional stimuli and higher spontaneous activity during the resting state than non-carriers .

22574175|Compared with the s/s group , the l/l group showed significantly increased regional homogeneity or local synchronization in the right amygdala during the resting state -LRB- | t | > 2.028 , p < 0.05 , corrected -RRB- , but no significant difference was found in the bilateral amygdala in response to negative stimuli in the emotional processing task .

22572572|The amygdala was chosen because it is involved in emotional processes , in part through its connections with the hippocampus .

22571805|We aimed to examine whether individual differences in amygdala activity to emotionally salient stimuli were related to heterogeneity in lifetime levels of depressive and subthreshold manic symptoms among adults with MDD .

22569152|These findings highlight the importance of the relation between pubertal status and morphometry of the hippocampus and amygdala , and of limbic and subcortical structures that have been implicated in emotional and social behaviors .

22560044|Potentiated amygdala response to repeated emotional pictures in borderline personality disorder . .

22560044|Compared with both control groups , BPD patients showed greater amygdala activation , particularly to the repeated emotional but not neutral pictures , and a prolonged return to baseline for the overall blood oxygen level-dependent response averaged across all pictures .

22560044|Despite amygdala overactivation , BPD patients showed blunted self-report ratings of emotional but not neutral pictures .

22560044|The increased amygdala response to the repeated emotional pictures observed in BPD was not observed in schizotypal patients , suggesting diagnostic specificity .

22558274|More specifically , HA scores were correlated with rsFCs between the laterobasal amygdala subregion and temporal and occipital cortices related to emotional information input , between the centromedial subregion and the frontal cortices associated with emotional output control , and between the superficial subregion and the frontal and temporal areas involved in both functions .

22547826|The amygdala is a brain structure that plays a pivotal role in emotion-related functions .

22547826|Investigating developmental characteristics of the amygdala and associated functional circuits in children is important for understanding how emotion processing matures in the developing brain .

22547826|These immature patterns of amygdala connectivity have important implications for understanding typical and atypical development of emotion-related brain circuitry .

22546702|Research suggests that emotional intelligence capacities may be related to the functional integrity of the corticolimbic regions including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex , insula , and amygdala .

22546319|While the amygdala historically has been implicated in emotional stimuli processing , recent data suggest a general role in parceling out the relevance of stimuli , regardless of their emotional properties .

22546319|Using functional magnetic resonance imaging , we tested the relevance hypothesis by investigating human amygdala responses to emotionally neutral stimuli while manipulating their relevance .

22546319|These findings suggest that the amygdala 's processing profile goes beyond detection of emotions per se , and directly support the proposed role in relevance detection .

22546319|Thus , the results may indicate that human amygdala modulates ventral striatum activity and subsequent behaviors beyond that observed for emotional cues , to encompass a broader range of relevant stimuli .

22535257|Child and adult bipolar patients show both behavioral deficits in face emotion processing and abnormal amygdala activation .

22535257|However , compared with bipolar adults and healthy child volunteers , pediatric bipolar patients showed amygdala hyperactivity in response to a broad array of emotional faces .

22532655|Functional differences have been reported in regions implicated in emotional and behavioural regulation , including the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex .

22530815|Specifically , BDNF gene expression and activation of its high-affinity tropomyosin-related kinase B -LRB- TrkB -RRB- receptor are necessary in the amygdala , hippocampus and prefrontal cortex for the formation of emotional memories , including fear memories .

22527118|Pharmacobehavioral studies in experimental animals , and imaging studies in humans , indicate that serotonergic transmission in the amygdala plays a key role in emotional processing , especially for anxiety-related stimuli .

22527118|Studies of serotonin receptor subtype co-expression indicate a differential impact of the serotonergic innervation on this small , but important , population of anxiolytic interneurons , and provide the basis for future studies of the circuitry underlying serotonergic modulation of emotional stimulus processing in the amygdala .

22523001|The amygdala is the central component of a functional brain system regulating fear and emotional behaviors .

22523001|We identified different periods of postnatal development of distinct amygdala nuclei and cellular components , which are concomitant with the ontogeny of different fear and emotional behaviors .

22521814|At the cellular level , a hippocampal interaction with immature neurons in the amygdala suggests a novel substrate for cellular plasticity , with implications for mechanisms underlying contextual learning and emotional memory processes .

22519463|Early evidence suggested the amygdala played a vital role in emotional processing , likely helping to encode emotionally charged stimuli .

22519463|Based on these findings and previous literature , we speculate that the amygdala likely charges AMs with emotional , social , and self-relevance .

22516367|Perception of nonverbally expressed emotions was associated with bilateral activation within the amygdala , fusiform face area -LRB- FFA -RRB- , temporal voice area -LRB- TVA -RRB- , and the posterior temporal cortex as well as in the midbrain and left inferior orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- / left insula .

22516367|Furthermore , the INDI correlated with responses in the left amygdala elicited by nonverbal and verbal emotional stimuli .

22512449|Glutamate and ?-aminobutyric acid -LRB- GABA -RRB- participate in central cardiovascular control , and are found in the rat posterodorsal medial amygdala -LRB- MePD -RRB- , an area of the forebrain that modulates emotional/social behaviors .

22510433|Relative to controls , BD individuals also showed abnormal patterns of effective connectivity between dACC and amygdala during high attentional control demand with emotional face distracters .

22507547|These results suggest that the information about objects suitable for the generation of appropriate emotional response is built up within the primate amygdala via an intra-amygdala network from the lateral nucleus to the central nucleus .

22496579|We report that a novel pathway from the amygdala , the brain 's emotional center , targets the inhibitory thalamic reticular nucleus -LRB- TRN -RRB- , a key node in the brain 's attentional network .

22496579|The robust amygdalar pathway provides a mechanism for rapid shifting of attention to emotional stimuli .

22496579|Acting synergistically , pathways from the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex provide a circuit for purposeful assessment of emotional stimuli .

22487600|We observed olfactory activity in the olfactory bulb , entorhinal cortex -LRB- 4 % -RRB- , amygdala -LRB- 2.5 % -RRB- and temporo-parietal cortex , especially in the areas related to emotional integration .

22487247|The amygdala is fundamental in expression of emotion , and is hyperactive in many patients with mood or anxiety disorders .

22486330|Results showed that , compared to never drinkers , binge drinkers performed worse on the IGT and showed higher activity in the subcomponents of the decision-making neural circuitry implicated in the execution of emotional and incentive-related behaviors , namely , the left amygdala and insula bilaterally .

22479245|Third , we survey the neuroimaging literature for evidence of a special role for the amygdala in MCI and early AD in emotional memory enhancement .

22473387|In human and nonhuman primates , the amygdala is known to play critical roles in emotional and social behavior .

22470326|Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- studies indicate agents used to treat anxiety , e.g. , SSRIs and benzodiazepines , attenuate amygdala , insula , and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- activation during emotional processing .

22470326|Our prior study has shown that during anticipation of an emotional stimulus , pregabalin attenuates amygdala and insula activation but increases medial PFC activation .

22470326|In this study , we examined whether , similar to SSRIs and benzodiazepines , pregabalin attenuates amygdala , insula , and medial PFC during emotional face processing .

22470326|Thus , pregabalin shares some similarity to SSRIs and benzodiazepines in attenuating anger and fear-related insula and amygdala activation during emotional face processing .

22470324|A bias toward the use of habit memory can also be produced by intra-basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- administration of anxiogenic drugs , consistent with the well documented role of efferent projections of this brain region in mediating the modulatory influence of emotional arousal on memory .

22468617|In the study reported here , functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- was used to measure activity in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex of 10 participants who completed two independent tasks of emotion regulation-reappraisal , measuring intentional emotion regulation , and affect labeling , measuring incidental emotion regulation-with the objective of identifying potential overlap in the neural substrates underlying each task .

22468617|For both tasks , fMRI showed decreased amygdala activation during emotion regulation compared with emotion conditions .

22468617|During reappraisal , this decrease in amygdala activation was accompanied by a proportional decrease in emotional intensity ratings ; during affect labeling , the decrease in amygdala activation correlated with self-reported aggression .

22464880|Corticosterone influences emotion and cognition via actions in a diversity of corticolimbic structures , including the amygdala .

22464181|Taken together , these results indicate that systemic salicylate treatment can induce hyperactivity and tonotopic shift in the amygdala and infusion of salicylate into the amygdala can profoundly enhance sound-evoked activity in AC , changes likely to increase the perception and emotional salience of tinnitus and loud sounds .

26952949|The amygdala and the orbitofrontal part of the cortex appear to be implicated as mediators , because of their broader involvement in emotional processing and executive control .

22457500|At earlier stages , emotional content was processed independently in the amygdala -LRB- 170 ms -RRB- , whereas directional cues -LRB- gaze direction with pointing gesture -RRB- were combined at ? 190 ms in the parietal and supplementary motor cortices .

22456823|Reduced amygdala response in youths with disruptive behavior disorders and psychopathic traits : decreased emotional response versus increased top-down attention to nonemotional features . .

22456823|Functional MRI was used to assess the response of the amygdala and regions implicated in top-down attentional control -LRB- the dorsomedial and lateral frontal cortices -RRB- to emotional expression under conditions of high and low attentional load .

22451349|This revealed that the individual differences in the emotional expression of discriminative fear learning -LRB- startle potentiation -RRB- were reflected in differential amygdala activation , regardless of the cognitive expression of fear learning -LRB- CS-US contingency or hippocampal activation -RRB- .

22450371|The amygdaloid complex , principally the basolateral complex -LRB- BLA -RRB- , plays a pivotal role in fear memory and in the modulation of stress-induced emotional responses .

22450197|For negative emotion , women exhibited greater activation than men in the left amygdala , as well as in other regions including the left thalamus , hypothalamus , mammillary bodies , left caudate , and medial prefrontal cortex .

22450197|In contrast , for positive emotion , men exhibited greater activation than women in the left amygdala , as well as greater activation in other regions including the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus and right fusiform gyrus .

22450197|These meta-analysis findings indicate that the amygdala , a key region for emotion processing , exhibits valence-dependent sex differences in activation to emotional stimuli .

22450197|The greater left amygdala response to negative emotion for women accords with previous reports that women respond more strongly to negative emotional stimuli , as well as with hypothesized links between increased neurobiological reactivity to negative emotion and increased prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders in women .

22450197|The finding of greater left amygdala activation for positive emotional stimuli in men suggests that greater amygdala responses reported previously for men for specific types of positive stimuli may also extend to positive stimuli more generally .

22448350|We studied the effect of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 on the intensity of free radical processes in emotiogenic brain structures -LRB- hypothalamus , sensorimotor cortex , and amygdala -RRB- in rats with different prognostic emotional resistance .

22445898|The neural circuitry underlying emotional learning and memory is known to involve both the amygdala and hippocampus .

22434239|In a functional MRI study on 7 - to 9-year-old children , we showed that math anxiety was associated with hyperactivity in right amygdala regions that are important for processing negative emotions .

22434239|Furthermore , effective connectivity between the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex regions that regulate negative emotions was elevated in children with math anxiety .

22432905|Our results suggest that by using a localized robust clustering approach , it is possible to probe activation in the right dorsal amygdala that is directly related to individual real-time emotional experience .

22425719|Shifting the focus of attention modulates amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex reactivity to emotional faces . .

22425719|Functional neuroimaging studies have largely established the prominence of amygdala during emotion processing and prefrontal areas such as anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- during attentional modulation .

22425719|In general , emotion processing paradigms known to probe amygdala have not been adapted to recruit prefrontal areas .

22425719|Results indicate that simply and volitionally directing attention toward or away from emotional content correspondingly modulates amygdala and ACC activity .

22424916|The amygdala contributes to production of emotional responses to environmental threats .

22424916|Blocking glutamate neurotransmission within the central nucleus of the amygdala suppressed rats ' emotional response to acute painful stimulation .

22420593|The amygdala seems to play a central role in this network and is responsible for appraisal of emotional stimuli .

22420593|Increased connectivity between the insula and right amygdala may generate excessive positive feedback , in that both of these regions are involved in the appraisal of emotional stimuli .

22420592|We used Granger Causality Mapping -LRB- GCM -RRB- to map EC between the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- and bilateral amygdala and a novel paradigm to assess emotion processing in adults with BD .

22420592|Our findings suggest major differences in recruitment of amygdala-PFC circuitry , supporting implicit emotion processing between remitted-BD and depressed-BD subjects , which may underlie changes from remission to depression in BD .

22411788|Based on the documented role of the insula in mediating emotional response tendencies and personality , we used multimodal imaging to characterize this region in WS and found convergent anomalies : an overall decrease in dorsal anterior insula -LRB- AI -RRB- gray-matter volume along with locally increased volume in the right ventral AI ; compromised white-matter integrity of the uncinate fasciculus connecting the insula with the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex ; altered regional cerebral blood flow in a pattern reminiscent of the observed gray-matter alterations -LRB- i.e. , widespread reductions in dorsal AI accompanied by locally increased regional cerebral blood flow in the right ventral AI -RRB- ; and disturbed neurofunctional interactions between the AI and limbic regions .

22407082|Mineralocorticoid receptor Iso/Val -LRB- rs5522 -RRB- genotype moderates the association between previous childhood emotional neglect and amygdala reactivity . .

22407082|Emerging research suggests that emotional neglect during childhood as well as hypercortisolemia may lead to heightened threat-related amygdala reactivity .

22407082|This raises the possibility that genetic variation affecting hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal -LRB- HPA -RRB- axis function contributes to individual differences in amygdala reactivity , both independently and as a function of childhood emotional neglect .

22407082|The study also explored the extent to which any effects of the genotype on amygdala reactivity were contingent upon previous childhood emotional neglect .

22407082|Prior childhood emotional neglect and the val allele were associated with greater amygdala reactivity .

22407082|Moreover , a significant genotype-by-emotional neglect interaction was observed whereby greater amygdala reactivity in val allele carriers was independent of previous childhood emotional neglect , while greater reactivity in iso homozygotes was revealed only in the context of a history of elevated emotional neglect .

22407082|At relatively low levels of previous emotional neglect , val carriers had heightened amygdala reactivity relative to iso homozygotes .

22406694|We discuss results from neuropsychology and neuroimaging research suggesting that specific mechanisms for emotional attention might exist , centered on the amygdala and other limbic regions , and that these mechanisms can operate partly independent from other circuits controlling spatial and object-based attention .

22406509|In healthy people , extraversion is associated with hemodynamic responses in the amygdala and electrophysiological brain activity such as event-related potential and event-related desynchronization during emotional face processing .

22404662|Prolonged amygdala response and a functional disconnection between ventral and dorsal mPFC regions may be part of the neural mechanisms underlying emotional dysregulation in BPD patients .

22401827|Ineffective emotion regulation and abnormal amygdala activation have each been found in adolescent-onset major depressive disorder .

22401827|However , amygdala activation during emotion regulation has not been studied in adolescent-onset major depressive disorder .

22401827|Imaging analyses demonstrated that adolescents with depression showed : -LRB- 1 -RRB- greater right amygdala activation during the maintain condition relative to controls , -LRB- 2 -RRB- less connectivity during the maintain condition between the amygdala and both the insula and medial prefrontal cortex than controls , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- a significant positive correlation between amygdala-seeded connectivities during maintenance of emotion and psychosocial functioning .

22401827|The current study is a cross-sectional comparison and longitudinal investigations with larger sample sizes are needed to examine the association between amygdala reactivity and emotion regulation over time in adolescent MDD .

22401827|A poorly modulated , overreactive amygdala may contribute to poor emotion regulation .

22398299|Lower activation of the amygdala , PCC and ACC in response to these words may contribute to the impairments of emotional processing that are hallmarks of alexithymia .

22398297|In this study , we measured amygdala activity in 27 young adults with early-onset MDD and 25 healthy controls -LRB- HC -RRB- using functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- with an emotional processing task .

22397907|Patients with BPD showed significantly longer reaction times -LRB- RTs -RRB- along with significantly higher activation in the amygdala and insula during emotional distraction compared to healthy participants , suggesting that they were more distracted by emotional pictures during the working memory task .

22384670|By plotting cross-correlation histograms differences were found in interaction of conjectural small '' interneurons '' and large principal cells of the central and basal amygdalar nuclei in negative emotional situations .

22381099|During the memory task with emotional background pictures , however , ASPD-BPD subjects compared to healthy controls showed delayed responses and enhanced activation of the left amygdala in the presence of emotionally high salient pictures independent of working memory load .

22373657|An important hub in these systems is the amygdala , which may not only monitor the emotional value of stimuli , but also readily project to several other areas and send feedback to sensory pathways -LRB- including striate and extrastriate visual cortex -RRB- .

22373657|We suggest that emotion signals may enhance processing efficiency and competitive strength of emotionally significant events through gain control mechanisms similar to those of other -LRB- e.g. endogenous -RRB- attentional systems , but mediated by distinct neural mechanisms in amygdala and interconnected prefrontal areas .

22371351|At rest , AP induced increased activation in the insula and in the amygdala , which have been previously associated with the autonomic control and emotion processing , as well as in the caudate nucleus and in the medial temporal cortex , both implicated in cognitive functions .

22365465|These pilot data suggest that both face emotion labeling deficits and amygdala hyperactivity during face processing should receive further study as potential BD endophenotypes .

22349683|The aim of the present study is to examine the influence of emotional content and emotional context on the memory in mild AD , and whether this influence is linked to amygdala volume .

22349683|Patients ' amygdala volume was positively correlated to emotional content memory effect , implying a reduced memory benefit from emotional content when amygdala was atrophied .

22342800|Gene therapy using recombinant viral vectors to induce overexpression of NPY , Y1 or Y2 receptors in the hippocampus or amygdala has previously been shown to modulate emotional behaviour and seizures in rodents .

22330316|Results showed robust evoked activation of all three tasks in their respective target regions -LRB- emotional task = amygdala ; motivational task = ventral striatum ; cognitive task = right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and parietal cortices -RRB- with high effect sizes -LRB- ES -RRB- of ROI-mean summary values -LRB- ES = 1.11-1 .44 for the faces task , 0.96-1 .43 for the reward task , 0.83-2 .58 for the n-back task -RRB- .

22313617|Emotion activation studies in these individuals have shown hyperactivation in emotion-related regions , including the amygdala and insula , and hypoactivation in emotion-regulation regions , including the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- and anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- .

22308257|Recent brain imaging studies were found to integrate previous findings that indicated altered responces of prefrontal cortex to cognitive stimuli and enhanced responces of amygdala to emotional faces .

22301434|We argue that genetically produced variability in serotonin reuptake during stressor-induced raphe-raphe interactions alters the balance in the amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- VMPFC -RRB- - DR circuitry underlying stressor reactivity and emotion regulation .

22289808|Study 2 demonstrated that socioeconomic status , an objective indicator of global standing , predicted adolescents ' neural activity during the processing of threatening faces , with individuals lower in social status displaying greater activity in the DMPFC , previously associated with mentalizing , and the amygdala , previously associated with emotion/salience processing .

22286798|Recent studies have demonstrated that odor-evoked autobiographic memories are more emotional than those elicited by other sensory stimuli because of the direct neural communication between the olfactory system and the amygdala .

22279232|The superior memory for emotional events has been attributed to the beneficial effects of noradrenaline released into the amygdala attributable to arousal .

22279232|Moreover , successful memory formation for stimuli followed by arousal was correlated with activity in the parahippocampal cortex but not the amygdala , as is the case for emotional stimuli .

22277521|Furthermore , our data from fear-conditioning experiment indicated that the key player in the processing of emotional memories appears to be the amygdala , which has tight connections to primary olfactory areas .

22275168|Emotion regulation strategies can alter behavioral and physiological responses to emotional stimuli and the neural correlates of those responses in regions such as the amygdala or striatum .

22273442|Dissociable patterns of medial prefrontal and amygdala activity to face identity versus emotion in bipolar disorder . .

22273442|During processing of all emerging emotions , euthymic individuals with bipolar disorder showed significantly greater amygdala activity .

22273442|Our findings of abnormally elevated activity in amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- during face identity and happy face emotion processing suggest functional abnormalities in key regions previously implicated in social processing .

22271789|These results suggest that the amygdala may represent emotionally relevant social group information as a subset of the general detection function it serves , whereas the striatum is involved in representing race-based reputations that shape trust decisions .

22270846|The amygdalae are involved in the perception of emotions such as happiness , anger and fear .

22269545|The Somatic Marker Framework theorizes that decision making is the product of two interacting affective neural systems , an impulsive , rapid , amygdala-dependent process for emotionally signalling the immediate negative or positive consequences of an option , and a reflective , longer-lasting , ventral medial prefrontal cortex dependent system for emotionally signalling the future negative or positive prospects of an option .

22267183|Region-of-interest analyses of the areas involved in emotion processing indicated that before treatment , depressed youths had significantly greater activations to fearful relative to neutral facial expressions than did healthy comparison subjects in the amygdala , orbitofrontal cortex , and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex bilaterally .

22264442|Comparative analysis identified genes with conserved transcript changes in amygdala -LRB- n = 29 -RRB- and cingulate cortex -LRB- n = 19 -RRB- , both critically involved in the generation and regulation of emotion .

22264442|Selected results were confirmed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction , including upregulation in the amygdala of transcripts for ADCY7 , a gene previously implicated in human depression and associated with altered emotional responsiveness in mouse models .

22258799|Enhanced amygdala reactivity to emotional faces in adults reporting childhood emotional maltreatment . .

22258799|We examined amygdala and mPFC reactivity to emotional faces -LRB- Angry , Fearful , Sad , Happy , Neutral -RRB- vs scrambled faces in healthy controls and unmedicated patients with depression and/or anxiety disorders reporting CEM before the age of 16 years -LRB- n = 60 -RRB- , and controls and patients who report no childhood abuse -LRB- n = 75 -RRB- .

22258799|We found that CEM was associated with enhanced bilateral amygdala reactivity to emotional faces in general , and independent of psychiatric status .

22258799|Furthermore , we found no support for differential mPFC functioning , suggesting that amygdala hyper-responsivity to emotional facial perception in adults reporting CEM may be independent from top-down influences of the mPFC .

22252376|Some suspected trends in the data are highlighted , including reductions in the hippocampi and amygdalae of BPD patients compared to healthy controls , exaggerated amygdala activity in BPD patients when confronted with emotion-related stimulus , and negative correlations between increases in left amygdalar creatine and reductions in amygdalar volume , reductions in absolute N-acetylaspartate concentration in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of BPD patients , and increases in glutamate concentration in the anterior cingulate cortices of BPD patients .

22252051|Since the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is involved in emotion-related memory , an intra-BLA lidocaine infusion was used immediately after the retrieval of two emotion-related memories , the step-through passive avoidance response -LRB- PA -RRB- and cocaine-induced conditioned place preference -LRB- CPP -RRB- .

22250290|Whereas the amygdala and midbrain showed only transient responses , the ventral basal forebrain and anterior insula showed sustained activity during extended emotional contexts that tracked positively with task-evoked anxiety .

22247040|The amygdala provides the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC ; areas 25 , 32 , and 24b -RRB- with salient emotional information .

22245645|The amygdala is critically involved in detecting emotionally salient stimuli and in enhancing memory for emotional information .

22245645|Growing evidence also suggests that the amygdala plays a crucial role in addiction , perhaps by strengthening associations between emotionally-charged drug cues and drug-seeking behavior .

22234338|In addition , variability of D1 receptor availability in the amygdala and striatum was related to individual differences in emotional responses and decision-making processes , respectively .

22230626|It appears that this small lobe , taking up less than 2 % of the total cortical surface area , receives afferents from some sensory thalamic nuclei , is -LRB- mostly reciprocally -RRB- connected with the amygdala and with many limbic and association cortical areas , and is implicated in an astonishingly large number of widely different functions , ranging from pain perception and speech production to the processing of social emotions .

22228752|Neural responses to emotional expressions at both time points were then correlated with a self-report measure of pubertal development , revealing positive associations with activity in amygdala , thalamus and visual cortical areas at age 10 that increased in magnitude and extent by age 13 .

22227141|Further , the emotional response -LRB- indexed via SCR -RRB- elicited by the threat was closely linked to amygdala activity .

22227141|These findings are consistent with the view that the amygdala and PFC support learning-related processes that influence the emotional response evoked by a threat .

22223035|The aim of this study was to evaluate the number of parasite cysts formed in the hippocampus and amygdala of experimentally infected mice as these regions are involved in defense behaviors control and emotion processing , and to assess the influence of the infection on mice behavior .

22217336|They also exhibited persistent increases in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left amygdala activity for the same stimuli during reappraisal , as well as additional activation in supplementary motor area and ventral caudate during the suppression of social positive emotions .

22217336|In contrast , anxiously attached participants showed differential increases in the right amygdala and left parahippocampal cortex for social negative and positive stimuli , respectively , but only when making spontaneous emotion judgments .

22210673|In contrast , impulsive-antisociality evidenced increased behavioral interference to both positive and negative words and correlated positively with recruitment of regions associated with motivational salience -LRB- amygdala , orbitofrontal cortex , insula -RRB- , emotion regulation -LRB- temporal cortex , superior frontal gyrus -RRB- and attentional control -LRB- dorsal anterior cingulate cortex -RRB- .

24179757|Altered emotional interference processing in the amygdala and insula in women with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder . .

22206877|Increased insular and amygdalar involvement during negative word encoding may underlie heightened experience of , and an inability to disengage from , negative emotions in depressive disorders .

22197572|All these studies suggest that unconscious processing of emotional information is mainly subsumed by a right hemisphere subcortical route , through which emotional stimuli quickly reach the amygdala .

22194673|It is accepted that the prefrontal cortex , amygdala , anterior cingulate cortex , hippocampus , and insula participate in the majority of emotional processes .

22189289|Increased functional connectivity between the amygdala and regions involved in emotion regulation may reduce negative emotional arousal while enhancing the incentive salience of the infant laughter .

22182770|In a previous fMRI study we assessed the neural correlates of audio-visual integration and found that activity in the left amygdala is significantly attenuated when a neutral stimulus is paired with an emotional one compared to conditions where emotional stimuli were present in both channels .

22182768|The results demonstrated spatial-temporal activations in the ACC and amygdala emotion-processing systems that changed with age .

22182768|The processing of emotions first engaged the earlier-developing amygdala responses and then involved the later-maturing ACC system .

22176700|Melanocortin-4 receptor in the medial amygdala regulates emotional stress-induced anxiety-like behaviour , anorexia and corticosterone secretion . .

22176700|The medial amygdala -LRB- MeA -RRB- is highly sensitive to emotional stress and expresses high levels of the melanocortin-4 receptor -LRB- MC4R -RRB- .

22174802|As extraversion is regarded a protective factor for developing anxiety disorders and depression and has been related to the generation of positive affect , the present results indicate that the reduced likelihood of developing affective disorders in individuals high on extraversion is related to modulation of emotion processing through the orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala .

22159123|This activation may provide input to posterior areas for iconic representations when required by the task , as well as to the hippocampal formation for categorical encoding and retrieval of memories , and to the amygdala for emotional associations .

22153720|These receptors are highly expressed in neurons of the hippocampal formation and the amygdala , areas that play a role in -LRB- emotional -RRB- memory formation .

22147775|Decreases in dorsolateral , orbitofrontal , and subgenual prefrontal cortices , striatum , amygdala , hippocampus , and cerebellum were associated with emotional neglect .

22141467|The basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- modulates memory for emotional events , and direct activation of the BLA following a learning session can enhance subsequent memory .

22129757|This emotional memory impairment was associated with significantly increased activity in the amygdala and the hippocampus for correctly recognized pictures at test .

22119640|This bias is associated with abnormal activities in emotion-processing regions -LRB- such as the amygdala -RRB- and cognitive-control regions -LRB- such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LSB- DLPFC -RSB- -RRB- .

22119526|REM sleep depotentiates amygdala activity to previous emotional experiences . .

22119526|Specifically , the marked suppression of central adrenergic neurotransmitters during REM -LRB- commonly implicated in arousal and stress -RRB- , coupled with activation in amygdala-hippocampal networks that encode salient events , is proposed to -LRB- re -RRB- process and depotentiate previous affective experiences , decreasing their emotional intensity .

22119526|Here , we demonstrate that REM sleep physiology is associated with an overnight dissipation of amygdala activity in response to previous emotional experiences , altering functional connectivity and reducing next-day subjective emotionality .

22119476|Stress reactivity was associated with less volume and tissue density in areas important for emotional regulation and the endocrine axis including prefrontal cortices , hippocampus , amygdala , and hypothalamus .

22115148|Analyses focused on a priori neural regions supporting emotion processing -LRB- amygdala -RRB- and emotion regulation -LRB- ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- VMPFC -RRB- , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- .

22113213|Although the role of the amygdala in processing facial expressions of fear is well established , its role in the processing of other emotions , such as sadness , remains unclear .

22113213|We hypothesized that the amygdala would respond to a negative emotion such as sadness , when sadness was represented by a theatrical mask .

22113213|We suggest the fact that such delicate sad masks could activate the amygdala , and it could possibly be because of an underlying similarity to emotions such as fear and disgust .

22112927|Amygdala responsiveness was measured by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging and an emotional face-matching paradigm particularly designed to activate the amygdala in response to threat-related faces .

22110588|In Experiment 2 , regression analyses identified affective impact -- a factor shown previously to influence the allocation of visual attention and amygdala response to negative emotional images -- as the strongest predictor of remembering .

22110089|The emotional circuits for fear have been well documented through studies demonstrating that lesions to the amygdala will block both conditioned and unconditioned fear behaviors .

22108508|Startle reflex amplitude , an index modulated by amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex and sensitive to aversive emotional stimuli , was overall larger in women .

22100721|Since FM 's lesions involve bilateral fusiform areas , it is unlikely that the amygdala-temporal projections explain the relative sparing of emotion discrimination performance .

22098264|Engagement of ventral , but not dorsal , amygdala during unaware exposure to emotional faces . .

22098264|In summary , this study points to a differential involvement of two clusters within the amygdala and their connected networks in naturally occurring perceptual biases of emotional content in faces .

22090463|To understand how amygdalar responses modulate auditory processing and drive emotional expression , we assessed how neurons respond to and encode information that is carried within complex acoustic stimuli .

22040134|Control centers of emotions -LRB- amygdala -RRB- , memory and learning -LRB- hippocampus -RRB- and sexual activity -LRB- hypothalamus -RRB- are modified according to the cyclical concentrations of both hormones .

22039511|The potentiation of emotional memory under hypothyroidism was associated with an increase of corticosterone release after fear conditioning and with higher expression of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors in the lateral and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala , nuclei that are critically involved in the circuitry of fear memory .

22036677|SVM allowed classification of the two groups with statistically significant accuracy -LRB- p = 0.017 -RRB- and identified group differences within an emotional circuitry including the amygdala , insula , anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex .

22019361|The reduced amygdala connectivity in schizophrenia shown here further illuminates the neural basis for the behavioral abnormalities in emotional and social function found in the disorder .

22015061|A modified version of the brain emotional learning based intelligent controller -LRB- BELBIC -RRB- , a bio-inspired algorithm based upon a computational model of emotional learning which occurs in the amygdala , is utilized for position controlling a real laboratorial rotary electro-hydraulic servo -LRB- EHS -RRB- system .

22009130|Twelve subjects viewed emotional faces to evoke amygdala activation .

22008524|Therefore , we investigated the effects of either late gestational or neonatal exposure to the GC receptor agonist dexamethasone -LRB- DEX -RRB- , on apoptosis within the amygdala , a region critical for emotional regulation .

22001285|We have previously demonstrated that the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is a key component of a neural circuit mediating memory formation for emotionally relevant stimuli in an ethologically-based model of conditioned fear , termed conditioned defeat -LRB- CD -RRB- .

21998031|We found that emotional responses , including startle eyeblink and amygdala responses , can effectively be modulated by social distance modulation .

21993193|Neuroimaging studies of emotion in schizophrenia have reported abnormalities in amygdala and other regions , although divergent results and heterogeneous paradigms complicate conclusions from single experiments .

21993193|For emotional perception , schizophrenia subjects showed reduced activation in bilateral amygdala , visual processing areas , anterior cingulate cortex , dorsolateral frontal cortex , medial frontal cortex , and subcortical structures .

21993193|Reduced reactivity of the amygdala appeared primarily in implicit studies of emotion , whereas deficits in anterior cingulate cortex activity appeared throughout all contrasts .

21970966|Although it is a pivotal structure in the processing of emotional stimuli , the amygdala does not seem necessary for the early stages of this process .

21964552|A subsequent functional magnetic resonance imaging study revealed that biologically emotional images induced stronger activity in the visual cortex and greater functional connectivity between the amygdala and visual cortex than did socially emotional images .

21964552|In contrast , socially emotional images evoked greater activity in the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- MPFC -RRB- and yielded stronger functional connectivity between the amygdala and MPFC than did biological images .

21962712|The human amygdala is critical for social cognition from faces , as borne out by impairments in recognizing facial emotion following amygdala lesions -LSB- 1 -RSB- and differential activation of the amygdala by faces -LSB- 2-5 -RSB- .

21962712|Single-unit recordings in the primate amygdala have documented responses selective for faces , their identity , or emotional expression -LSB- 6 , 7 -RSB- , yet how the amygdala represents face information remains unknown .

21961777|Our finding of an attenuated relationship between the amygdala , a region affected in MDD and involved in emotion processing , and cognitive control regions is consistent with a hypothesis of altered regulation of emotional processing in C-MDD , suggesting developmental continuity of this alteration into early childhood .

21954381|Due to the importance of amygdala and prefrontal cortex in regulating emotional responses , we predicted chronic changes in NPY expression could contribute to persistent behavioral deficits seen in this model .

21954381|The observed changes in NPY expression are consistent with maladaptive coping and enhanced emotionality , due to the nature of NPY signaling within these respective regions , and the nature of reciprocal connections between amygdala and prefrontal cortex .

21940454|Congruent emotions were characterized by activation in amygdala , insula , ventral posterior cingulate -LRB- vPCC -RRB- , temporo-occipital , and auditory cortices ; incongruent emotions activated a frontoparietal network and bilateral caudate nucleus , indicating a greater processing load in working memory and emotion-encoding areas .

21940454|These findings document that emotional information does not merge at the perceptual audiovisual integration level in unimodal or multimodal areas , but in vPCC and amygdala .

21935985|During both internally and externally generated movement , conversion disorder patients relative to normal volunteers had lower left supplementary motor area -LRB- SMA -RRB- -LRB- implicated in motor initiation -RRB- and higher right amygdala , left anterior insula , and bilateral posterior cingulate activity -LRB- implicated in assigning emotional salience -RRB- .

21935483|Negative and positive emotionality differentially affected the hemodynamic responses to encoding and retrieval in the amygdala , with increased responses during encoding negative word and face pairs .

21935483|These findings suggest that activation of the amygdala induced by negative emotion during encoding may disrupt associative memory performance .

21931738|We investigated the feasibility of training healthy humans to self-regulate the hemodynamic activity of the amygdala , which plays major roles in emotional processing .

21925523|The amygdala is involved in the emotional responses to fear including anxiety and heightened pain reporting .

21924326|Combined , our data indicate that Gpr26 is important for emotion regulation in mice , a function probably mediated by the phosphorylation of CREB in the central amygdala .

21922004|After the association , CS input is conveyed through the amygdala to different brain regions including the hippocampus for contextual fear formation , to the supramammillary and thalamic paraventricular nuclei for stressful anxiety or memory dependent fearful or stressful emotion , to the reward system to induce aversive expression to the CS , or hedonic shift from positive to negative , and to the CS-responsive neurons in the gustatory system to enhance the responsiveness to facilitate to detect the harmful stimulus .

21920442|Using a robust multiple regression approach , we examined the effects of social anxiety , anxiety sensitivity , and trait anxiety -LRB- which overlapped with depressive symptoms , and can therefore be considered a measure of negative affectivity -RRB- on activation in insula , amygdala , and medial prefrontal cortex , in response to emotional faces .

21920442|Adjusting for negative affectivity and anxiety sensitivity , social anxiety was associated with activity in left amygdala , right insula , and subgenual anterior cingulate across all emotional faces .

21920410|This study has investigated the role of hypothalamic and amygdalar type-1 cannabinoid -LRB- CB1 -RRB- receptors in the emotional and neuroendocrine responses to stress .

21912749|Interplay of amygdala and cingulate plasticity in emotional fear . .

21912749|The amygdala is known to be a critical brain region for emotional fear .

21912749|To study fear-related synaptic plasticity in the cortex and its functional connectivity with neurons in the amygdala and hippocampus will help us understand brain mechanisms of fear and improve clinical treatment of emotional disorders in patients .

21910238|We suggest that the relative strengths in emotion and face processing are consistent with the patient 's apparently able social behavior , and with intact amygdalar function .

21910076|In contrast , other studies provide evidence for an age-related decrease in autonomic nervous system physiological arousal , particularly in response to emotionally negative stimuli , and for shifts in central nervous system physiologic response to emotional stimuli , with increased prefrontal cortex activation and decreased amygdala activation in aging .

21909801|Either impaired memory and hippocampal atrophy , or emotional disturbances and atrophy of the amygdala follow , seemingly dependent on the method used for disruption of the blood-brain barrier .

21908848|Evidence is also presented that implicates a region of the medial prefrontal cortex , involved in emotion regulation , in modulating amygdala output to determine awareness of emotional visual stimuli ; when emotional stimuli are present , the conscious perception of alternative stimuli requires greater regulatory influences from cortical structures .

21907809|HC subjects showed increased early activation in the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- and the amygdala following up-regulation of emotions to negative scripts , whereas BPD and non-PTSD subjects showed early deactivation in the PFC. Additionally , the anterior cingulate cortex was more activated in HC subjects than in BPD and non-PTSD subjects during up - and down-regulation .

21902800|Positron emission tomography -LRB- PET -RRB- , functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- and magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- studies examining responses to food intake and food cues , dopamine function and brain volume in lean vs. obese individuals are now beginning to coalesce in identifying irregularities in a range of regions implicated in reward -LRB- e.g. striatum , orbitofrontal cortex , insula -RRB- , emotion and memory -LRB- e.g. amygdala , hippocampus -RRB- , homeostatic regulation of intake -LRB- e.g. hypothalamus -RRB- , sensory and motor processing -LRB- e.g. insula , precentral gyrus -RRB- , and cognitive control and attention -LRB- e.g. prefrontal cortex , cingulate -RRB- .

21896493|The amygdala 's contribution to emotion , cognition and behavior depends on its interactions with subcortical and cortical regions .

21894151|The amygdala has a central role in the processing of novelty and emotion in the brain .

21894151|Although there is considerable variability among individuals in the reactivity of the amygdala to novel and emotional stimuli , the origin of these individual differences is not well understood .

21893167|Furthermore , growing evidence indicates that these different glucocorticoid effects depend on a nongenomically mediated interaction with emotional arousal-induced noradrenergic activation within the basolateral complex of the amygdala .

21889991|Amygdala involvement in visual emotional processing has been unequivocally established , but the amygdala 's participation in auditory emotional processing is less clear .

21889991|In a previous functional magnetic resonance imaging study -LRB- Klinge et al. , 2010 -RRB- we investigated the amygdala 's role in auditory emotional processing in blind and sighted humans .

21889991|We observed stronger amygdala responses to auditory emotional stimuli in the blind who were also better at discriminating emotional stimuli .

21889991|While these data suggested that the amygdala serves the dominant sensory modality for emotional perception , we could not rule out possible influences of use-dependent training effects .

21889991|Taken together , the data from our two studies suggest that enhanced amygdala responses in the blind are mainly due to deprivation-induced plasticity , as highly trained actors who possess the same excellent emotion discrimination skills as the blind did not show these responses .

21889991|It is also conceivable that the actors ' training requires a more professional and controlled dealing with the emotional stimuli , resulting in a down-regulation of affective experience and accompanying amygdala responses .

21889953|Only a subset of prefrontal areas are likely to directly influence amygdalar processing , and as such models of prefrontal control of emotions and models of emotional regulation should be constrained to plausible pathways of influence .

21888979|The amygdala and the associative cortex were conjointly activated by all basic emotions .

21888979|Such findings informed the definition of three effective connectivity models , testing for the functional integration of visual cortex and amygdala , as regions processing all emotions , with domain-specific regions , namely : i -RRB- for fear , the frontoparietal system involved in preparing adaptive motor responses ; ii -RRB- for disgust , the somatosensory system , reflecting protective responses against contaminating stimuli ; iii -RRB- for happiness : medial prefrontal and temporoparietal cortices involved in understanding joyful interactions .

21888979|Consistently with these domain-specific models , the results of the effective connectivity analysis indicate that the amygdala is involved in distinct functional integration effects with cortical networks processing sensorimotor , somatosensory , or cognitive aspects of basic emotions .

21887312|Here , we systematically examine the role of Npas4 in auditory Pavlovian fear conditioning , an amygdala-dependent form of emotional learning .

21884761|The molecular constituents of endocannabinoid -LRB- eCB -RRB- signaling are abundantly expressed within the mammalian amygdaloid complex , consistent with the robust role of eCB signaling in the modulation of emotional behavior , learning , and stress-response physiology .

21884712|Attentional capture by emotional stimuli is preserved in patients with amygdala lesions . .

21884712|In the current study , we examined whether the amygdala was necessary for this emotional modulation of attention to occur .

21884712|Patients with unilateral amygdala lesions and matched controls completed an emotional attentional blink task in which emotional distractors impair the perception of subsequent targets .

21884712|These data argue against a central role for the amygdala in mediating all types of attentional capture by emotional stimuli .

21882422|This property might be sustained by the direct connections established by the olfactory bulb and piriform/olfactory cortex on two structures involved in emotion and memory , namely the amygdala and hippocampus .

21881566|Functional connectivity analysis revealed that among synchronous mothers , left NAcc and right amygdala were functionally correlated with emotion modulation , theory-of-mind , and empathy networks .

21878394|We hypothesized that PPP1R1B should have a significant influence on the network of brain regions involved in associative emotional learning that are rich in DARPP-32 , namely the striatum , prefrontal cortex -LRB- comprising the medial frontal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus -LRB- IFG -RRB- -RRB- , amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus -LRB- PHG -RRB- .

21878364|The present findings raise the possibility that cognitive vulnerability to depression might be characterized by hypoactivation of the prefrontal cortex and hyperactivation of the amygdala in response to emotional stimuli ; our observations might provide a potential interpretation to explain the abnormalities in neural networks mediating cognitive modulation of emotions in individuals with cognitive vulnerability to depression .

21875654|Muscarinic cholinergic neurotransmission in the amygdala is critical for memory consolidation in emotional/motivational learning tasks , but little is known about the neuronal distribution of different receptor subtypes .

21874014|The amygdala is important in emotion , but it remains unknown whether it is specialized for certain stimulus categories .

21872671|Considerable evidence indicates that the noradrenergic system of the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- participates in the consolidation of various types of emotionally arousing memories .

21861676|In both emotion and pain paradigms , the amygdala reflected regulatory success .

21861676|Notably , we found that greater emotion regulation success was associated with greater change of amygdalar activity following pain regulation .

21861676|Furthermore , individual differences in degree of amygdalar change following emotion regulation were a strong predictor of pain regulation success , as well as of the degree of amygdalar engagement following pain regulation .

21861391|-LSB- Influence of anxiolytic afobazole on amygdalar neuronal activity and behavior of rabbits in emotionally negative situations -RSB- . .

21861391|The influence of systemic injection of anxiolytic afobazole -LRB- 1 mg/kg -RRB- on interaction between neurons of the basal and central amygdaloor nuclei and behavior of rabbits in negative emotional situations was studied in order to reveal characteristics of amygdalar neuronal network properties during unconditioned fear .

21861171|Increased in vivo release of neuropeptide S in the amygdala of freely moving rats after local depolarisation and emotional stress . .

21861171|Thus , our data demonstrate for the first time emotional stress-induced release of NPS in the amygdala supporting a functional role of endogenous NPS in stress/anxiety-related phenomena .

21860224|The amygdala is a forebrain center involved in functions and behaviors that are critical for survival -LRB- such as control of the neuroendocrine system and homeostasis , and reproduction and fear/escape responses -RRB- and in cognitive functions such as attention and emotional learning .

21855604|Substantial expression levels of NK-2 mRNA were observed in all the brain regions examined , including areas pertinent to the emotional networks such as the prefrontal cortex , cingulate cortex and amygdala .

21854858|Neuroimaging results showed that , while amygdala activation did not differ significantly between groups , euthymic patients showed a significant decrease in activation of the right vlPFC -LRB- BA47 -RRB- compared to healthy controls during emotion labeling .

21854858|These data , taken in context with prior studies of bipolar mania using the same emotion recognition task , could suggest that amygdala dysfunction may be a state-related abnormality in bipolar disorder , whereas vlPFC dysfunction may represent a trait-related abnormality of the illness .

21854369|A core set of brain regions appear to mediate these collective psychological functions , most notably the cortical midline structures , the amygdala , the insula , posterior parietal cortex and temporal poles , suggesting that problems in one area -LRB- e.g. emotional awareness -RRB- may relate to difficulties in another -LRB- e.g. self-referential processing -RRB- .

21849983|Here , we show that stress-induced development of anxiety-like behavior is paralleled by a transient appearance of low-frequency stimulation-induced , 2-AG-mediated long-term depression at GABAergic synapses in the basolateral amygdala , a key region involved in motivation , affective regulation , and emotional learning .

21835189|Role of the left amygdala and right orbital frontal cortex in emotional interference resolution facilitation in working memory . .

21835189|Results indicate that when the left amygdala is damaged , emotional facilitation of interference resolution is absent -LRB- equal emotional and neutral interference levels -RRB- , when the right orbital frontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- is damaged , in contrast , emotional interference resolution is impaired -LRB- emotional interference levels are higher than neutral levels are -RRB- .

21827834|Conversely , CB -LRB- 1 -RRB- receptor activation within distinct amygdalar nuclei yields opposing effects on emotional behavior , such that local stimulation of CB -LRB- 1 -RRB- receptors in the basolateral amygdala and central amygdala promoting anxiogenesis and anxiolysis , respectively .

21823207|The fMRI results revealed amygdala activity for both Anger and Direct gaze conditions , suggesting emotional arousal .

21820247|During emotion identification , TD heightened activation in the orbital frontal cortex and bilateral amygdala , and this effect was attenuated by estradiol treatment .

21818344|Therefore , in this study we used the 5-HTT-deficient mouse model for studying emotional dysregulation to evaluate consequences of genotype specific disruption of 5-HTT function and repeated social defeat for fear-related behaviors and corresponding neurophysiological activities in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- and infralimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- in male 5-HTT wild-type -LRB- + / + -RRB- , homo - -LRB- - / - -RRB- and heterozygous -LRB- + / - -RRB- mice .

21784971|We examined whole-brain functional connectivity of two brain structures previously implicated in emotional face processing in autism : the amygdala bilaterally and the right pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus -LRB- rIFGpo -RRB- .

21784302|Using dynamic causal modeling , we also examined the effective connectivity of two regions associated with emotional reactivity , i.e. , the amygdala and the lateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- LPFC -RRB- .

21783174|We completed functional magnetic resonance imaging targeting the amygdala with an emotion-matching task and concurrent infrared eye tracking , FMR1 molecular genetic testing , and neuropsychological assessment in 23 men with the premutation -LRB- mean age = 32.9 years -RRB- and 25 male control subjects -LRB- mean age = 30.1 years -RRB- .

21782901|Particularly , we investigated whether amygdala and insula responses , brain regions consistently implicated in emotional processing , would be modulated by this strategy .

21782901|Thus , the present study provides new evidence on reappraisal strategies to down-regulate emotional reactions and suggest that amygdala and insula responses to emotional stimuli are adaptive and highly flexible .

21781000|Specifically , patients with prominent anxiety symptoms generally overreact to emotional cues , which has been linked to increased amygdala activation .

21781000|We assessed 21 OCD patients and 21 healthy controls with fMRI during an emotional face-processing paradigm involving active response generation to test for alterations in both brain activation and task-induced functional connectivity of the frontal cortex , the amygdala and the fusiform face area .

21775979|While duloxetine suppressed the neural correlates of emotional memory formation in general , it specifically enhanced amygdala processes associated with mood-incongruent memory retrieval .

21761197|The cerebellar activations associated with negative emotions occurred concomitantly with activations of mirror neuron domains such as the insula and amygdala .

21757239|It is hypothesized that intentional perception of emotional faces activates connections between amygdala -LRB- Demir et al. -RRB- , orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- , anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- and prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- and that frontal-amygdala connections are altered in major depressive disorder -LRB- MDD -RRB- .

21757239|The interpretation of these findings could be that there is an emotional processing bias with disconnection bilaterally between amygdala to orbitofrontal cortices and in addition a right disconnection between amygdala and ACC as well as between ACC and prefrontal cortex possibly in line with a more prominent role for the right hemisphere in emotion processing .

21757136|These include basal ganglia and related cortex for emotion and drive -LRB- striatum , amygdala , hypothalamus , and hippocampus -RRB- , and regulatory cortical regions -LRB- anterior cingulate , insula medial frontal , and orbitofrontal cortices -RRB- .

21756925|The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study investigated the role of emotion-related -LRB- e.g. , amygdala -RRB- and self-related brain structures -LRB- MPFC in particular -RRB- in the processing of emotional words varying in stimulus reference .

21756925|These results demonstrate that amygdala activation in response to emotional stimuli is modulated by stimulus reference and that brain structures implicated in emotional and self-related processing might be important for the subjective experience of one 's own emotions .

21752593|The amygdala has been consistently implicated in the etiology of this social profile , particularly given its role in emotional and social behavior .

21750247|Implicit processing of emotional prosody engaged regions in the posterior superior temporal gyrus -LRB- pSTG -RRB- and bilateral IFG subregions , whereas explicit processing relied more on mid STG , left IFG , amygdala , and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex .

21749924|With this ecologically valid stimulus we found that narrative intensity was accompanied by activation in temporal cortices , medial geniculate nuclei in the thalamus and amygdala , brain regions that are all part of the system for processing conditioned emotional responses to auditory stimuli .

21744432|The amygdala plays a fundamental role in the neural processing of emotional stimuli and is a core structure of the brain-gut axis -LRB- BGA -RRB- that represents the anatomo-functional substrate for the bidirectional influences between emotions and gastrointestinal functions .

21744309|The negative emotional state that drives such negative reinforcement is hypothesized to derive from dysregulation of specific neurochemical elements involved in reward and stress within the basal forebrain structures involving the ventral striatum and extended amygdala , respectively .

21740626|Here , we studied whether memory bias is related to amygdala and hippocampal volume , two structures that are critical for emotional memory processes and that show consistent volume alterations in depression .

21737434|While judging faces as untrustworthy in comparison to trustworthy , men with XXY displayed less activation than controls in -LRB- i -RRB- the amygdala , which plays a key role in screening information for socio-emotional significance , -LRB- ii -RRB- the insula , which plays a role in subjective emotional experience , as well as -LRB- iii -RRB- the fusiform gyrus and -LRB- iv -RRB- the superior temporal sulcus , which are both involved in the perceptual processing of faces and which were also less involved during age judgments in men with XXY .

21726490|Impaired top-down regulation of the amygdala , and its modulation by serotonin -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- , is strongly implicated in the dysregulation of negative emotion that characterizes a number of affective disorders .

21726490|This study investigated the role of 5-HT within the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- , on the expression of appetitive Pavlovian conditioned emotional responses and their reversal in a primate , the common marmoset .

21726490|These data demonstrate the critical role of the amygdala in the expression of appetitive autonomic conditioning , and the region-selective contribution of 5-HT in the amygdala and OFC , respectively , to the expression of conditioned behaviour and the overall coordination of the emotional response .

21725038|Moreover , they also elicited a higher amygdalar response than even the emotional control condition .

21723130|Human voices play a fundamental role in social communication , and areas of the adult '' social brain '' show specialization for processing voices and their emotional content -LRB- superior temporal sulcus , inferior prefrontal cortex , premotor cortical regions , amygdala , and insula -RRB- .

21691052|Based on evidence for structural and functional preservation of the amygdala in older adults and findings that older adults show greater prefrontal cortex activity than younger adults while engaging in emotion-processing tasks , we argue that the cognitive control hypothesis is a more likely explanation for older adults ' positivity effect than the aging-brain model .

21689767|Whereas correlation analysis did not indicate any link between brain activation and extraversion , strong positive correlations between measures of neuroticism and hemodynamic responses of the right amygdala , the left postcentral gyrus as well as medial frontal structures including the right anterior cingulate cortex emerged , suggesting that brain mechanisms mediating the decoding of emotional speech melody may vary depending on differences in neuroticism among individuals .

21683947|It suggests that emotional responses to music can be at least partially preserved at a non-verbal level in patients with unilateral temporal lobe damage including the amygdala .

21666130|Brain imaging revealed increased activation of both primary emotional areas such as the amygdala and of higher cognitive areas such as the inferior frontal gyrus -LRB- IFG -RRB- and medial frontal gyrus .

21666130|The dynamic causal modeling with Bayesian model selection suggested that the IFG first receives the input and that the connections are bidirectional , suggesting that during such emotional picture-word pair learning , the frontal cortex drives the amygdala activation .

21666130|Specifically , the interaction between the frontal regions and the amygdala was enhanced by active learning involving both negative and positive emotional stimuli as compared with neutral stimuli .

21664448|Little is known about neuroapoptosis in the central extended amygdala and the pyriform cortex , which are key structures in emotional/social behaviors .

21621549|Connectivity between right parahippocampus and bilateral amygdala/periamygdala was also enhanced during correct post-sleep attribution of emotional contexts .

21620907|Additional connectivity analyses revealed that a negative coupling between lateral PFC on the one hand and amygdala and OFC on the other is related to enhanced interference resolution which can be tentatively interpreted as evidence that emotional regulation is an integrated part of an agent 's efforts to preserve cognitive performance in affective situations .

21618234|The amygdala is part of a neural network that contributes to the regulation of emotional behaviors .

21568644|Although we found no evidence for greater amygdala reactivity or reduced amygdala-sgACC coupling in short variant 5-HTTLPR homozygotes -LRB- s/s -RRB- , we observed an interaction between genotype and emotion in sgACC .

21562275|Since modulation of amygdala activity is known to alter the consolidation of emotionally influenced memories allocated in other brain regions , the nongenomic action of GC on the amygdala shown herein may also participate in the amygdala-dependent modulation of memory consolidation .

21451037|In adult animals , the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- plays a significant role in regulating emotions and projects to the amygdala and periaqueductal gray -LRB- PAG -RRB- to modulate emotional responses .

21440607|Research data suggest that the amygdala is central in regulating emotional processing of visual stimuli , even if it is presented subliminally .

21420406|The C/C genotype was associated with greater anxiety symptoms in patients with IBS and controls and increased activation of the amygdala under emotional and nonemotional conditions .

21420406|Regardless of diagnosis , the C/C genotype of the c.-42C > T polymorphism in HTR3A , compared with T carrier status , is associated with increased anxiety and amygdala responsiveness during emotional and nonemotional tasks .

21414462|All participant groups , including those with amygdala lesions , detected emotional targets more efficiently than neutral targets .

21414462|These data indicate that the amygdala is not necessary for emotion-guided visual search and suggest that other mechanisms beyond the amygdala help guide attention toward threatening stimuli .

21381821|SM , a patient with complete , focal , bilateral amygdala damage , and deficits in social and emotional processing , and five healthy comparison participants , each interacted with a familiar partner .

21381821|These results support the conclusion that the amygdala , a structure critical for social and emotional processing , plays an important role in the acquisition and use of common ground and in social communication more broadly .

21375794|Using a pharmacological strategy of tackling this stress-related mechanism to enhance human episodic -LRB- autobiographical -RRB- memory , we measured amygdala-hippocampal responses during encoding of emotional and neutral stimuli with functional magnetic resonance imaging in 51 healthy subjects under four pharmacological conditions in a double-blind parallel group design : -LRB- i -RRB- placebo ; -LRB- ii -RRB- the NE-reuptake inhibitor reboxetine -LRB- 4 mg -RRB- ; -LRB- iii -RRB- hydrocortisone -LRB- synthetic CORT -RRB- -LRB- 30 mg -RRB- ; or -LRB- iv -RRB- both agents in combination .

21363930|Here , we report the expression of Kiss1 in the amygdala , predominantly in the medial nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- MeA -RRB- , a region implicated in social and emotional behaviors as well as various aspects of reproduction .

21356318|Patients exhibited an amygdala hyperactivation during the emotional task and decreased functional coupling of the left amygdala with the medial orbitofrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus .

21352899|Functional neuroimaging studies in humans have revealed that the hippocampus , amygdala and anterior cingulate , areas of the brain involved in emotion , attention and spatial processing , are also involved in auditory memory and tinnitus perception .

21332487|Considering that activities in such emotion-responsive areas as the amygdala and insula can be detected through functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- , we used fMRI to further study the transferable placebo anxiolytic effect .

21320764|In this study , the neuropsychological hypotheses of amygdala and prefrontal cortex involvement in WS hypersociability was explored using three behavioral tasks -- facial emotional recognition task , a social approach task and a go no/go task .

21320610|We further combined our paradigm with high-resolution fMRI which enabled us to localize clusters of activation in amygdala subregions : purely facial-expression evoked signal changes were observed in the accessory basal nucleus , whereas our data suggest a critical role of the corticomedial amygdala in linking contextual information to emotional faces and in deciphering the significance of the faces for the observer .

21320516|In women , the ventral system implicated ín detection and appraisal of emotion was activated , including amygdala , insula , and Anterior Cingulate Cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- .

21316467|Previous studies have observed a sex-dependent lateralization of amygdala activation related to emotional memory .

21316467|Using a large sample of 235 male adolescents and 235 females matched for age and handedness , we investigated the sex-specific lateralization of amygdala activation during an emotional face perception fMRI task .

21316467|Our results indicate that adolescents display a sex-dependent lateralization of amygdala activation that is also present in basic processes of emotional perception .

21316204|The constellation of increased activity of the amygdala and decreased activity of the cingulate cortex likely represents parts of a negative feedback loop of emotional processing .

21309108|The amygdala , a limbic structure related to emotional behavior , has a putative role in the evaluation of emotional events and formation of fearful memories ; it is also a target of the neurochemical and hormonal mediators of stress .

21309108|Clinical and experimental data have correlated changes in the structure/function of the amygdala with emotional disorders such as anxiety .

21296865|Neurally , reappraisal of bottom-up generated emotions resulted in a paradoxical increase of amygdala activity .

21284912|Both groups exhibited increased brain activity during the perception of emotional faces relative to neutral ones in multiple brain regions , including multiple prefrontal regions bilaterally , the right amygdala , right cingulate cortex and cuneus .

21284912|These results suggest that many of the brain regions involved in emotional face perception , including the amygdala , are equally recruited in both schizophrenia and controls , but flat affect can also moderate activity in some other brain regions , notably in the left amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus bilaterally .

21272655|Fear and stop : a role for the amygdala in motor inhibition by emotional signals . .

21272655|Brain imaging data revealed that emotional cues during stop trials interacted with activity in limbic regions encompassing the basal amygdala and sublenticular extended amygdala region , as well as with the supplementary motor area -LRB- SMA -RRB- .

21272655|Taken together , our findings suggest that the amygdala may not only promote protective motor reactions in emotionally-significant contexts -LRB- such as freezing or defensive behavior -RRB- but also influence the execution of ongoing actions by modulating brain circuits involved in motor control , so as to afford quick and adaptive changes in current behavior .

21262244|It is well known that amygdala activity during encoding corresponds with subsequent memory for emotional information .

21259387|Although there were no differences in memory performance between groups , the common deletion variant of ADRA2B was related to enhanced activity in the amygdala and inferior frontal gyrus during successful emotional memory formation , but not retrieval .

21259387|Our results demonstrate that the ADRA2B polymorphism influences emotional memory formation but not memory retrieval in the amygdala and left inferior frontal gyrus .

21258093|Analysis showed that with increasing cognitive demand -LRB- long relative to short sequences -RRB- , neural responses to emotional pictures were significantly reduced in amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex .

21256226|The primary focus of research on the amygdala has been on the detection of and response to emotion but the amygdala also sometimes responds to new or unexpected stimuli without specific emotional content .

21256226|Both emotional and neutral images of humans evoked more amygdala activity when novel than when repeated .

21256226|Surprisingly , emotion was not necessary for amygdalar novelty responses , but the presence of a human representation was important .

21256142|Introduction to the Special Issue on the human amygdala and emotional function . .

21254899|Mice lacking GRPR presented with deficient light-induced phase shift in activity as well altered emotional learning and amygdala function .

21248136|Neuroplasticity in the amygdala plays a key role in emotional-affective pain responses and depends on group I metabotropic glutamate receptors -LRB- mGluRs -RRB- and protein kinases .

21246665|The short allele of the serotonin-transporter-linked promoter region -LRB- 5-HTTLPR -RRB- polymorphism is associated with increased amygdala activation in response to emotional stimuli .

21246665|Although top-down processes may moderate this association , available evidence is conflicting , showing the genotype influence on amygdala reactivity to be either decreased or increased during emotion regulation .

21246665|First , there was a genotype × condition interaction in the right amygdala : short allele carriers displayed increased amygdala activation and decreased functional connectivity with the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex in self-referential processing versus emotion labeling .

21246665|Second , in line with our hypothesis , there was a genotype × condition × stress interaction in bilateral amygdala the amygdala activation during self-referential processing was negatively correlated with self-reported life stress in short allele carriers and positively in individuals homozygous for the long allele , whereas an opposite pattern was observed during emotion labeling .

21241462|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- can modulate cortical functions and interactions between this structure and the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- are important for integrating emotionally salient information .

21238489|Impaired conditioned emotional response and object recognition are concomitant to neuronal damage in the amygdala and perirhinal cortex in middle-aged ischemic rats . .

21232892|With the GLM-detected brain activation regions in the emotion-related cortex during the block design paradigm , the conditional GCM method was proposed to study the causality of the habituation between the left amygdala and pregenual cingulate cortex during emotion processing .

21228162|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- assigns emotional significance to sensory stimuli .

21221523|Affect dysregulation subsumes enhanced resting arousal , increased emotional responsiveness as well as deficient emotional regulation and is associated with structural and functional abnormalities in a prefrontal-limbic network , above all orbitofrontal hypoactivity and amygdalar as well as insular hyperactivity .

21215794|The amygdala is widely recognized to play a central role in emotional processing .

21215794|In nonhuman primates , the amygdala appears to be critical for generating appropriate behavioral responses in emotionally salient contexts .

21215794|Despite a large literature documenting the role of the amygdala in emotional processing in adult rhesus macaques , little research has assessed the role of the amygdala across the macaque neurodevelopmental trajectory .

21215794|Taken together , these findings suggest that early damage to the amygdala , like damage sustained during adulthood , permanently compromises emotional processing .

21215733|The inversion effect for neutral and emotional facial expressions on amygdala activity . .

21215733|Neuroimaging studies have reported activation of the amygdala in response to faces and emotional facial expressions .

21215733|Here we investigated amygdala activity during the presentation of upright and inverted facial expressions of neutral and fearful emotions by measuring functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- while healthy subjects passively viewed these stimuli .

21215733|The right amygdala was found to be more active in response to upright compared to inverted faces displaying both neutral and fearful emotions .

21215733|These results suggest that the amygdala is involved in configural/holistic visual processing for faces and emotional facial expressions .

21215728|During the anticipation of emotional stimuli of prior known negative and prior ambiguous emotional valence , brain activity in patients with SAD was increased in the upper midbrain/dorsal thalamus , the amygdala , and in temporo-occipital and parietal regions as compared to control subjects .

21204425|Our findings indicate that adrenal stress hormones influence memory consolidation of emotional experiences via interactions with arousal-induced activation of noradrenergic mechanisms within the amygdala .

21204425|Many of these studies have been guided by findings from animal research that identified the amygdala as a key candidate brain region crucial to emotional memory .

21195392|The attempt to increase negative emotions resulted in enhanced activity in amygdala and insula , whereas no group differences were found .

21195195|Using an emotional face matching task we demonstrated that duloxetine reduced neural responses in affect processing regions including the amygdala , the anterior insula , the thalamus and the ventral aspect of the anterior cingulate cortex .

21195103|Using functional magnetic resonance imaging , we observed amygdala activation associated with the reduced attentional blink for emotional T2 in the face of neutral T1 .

22833192|During negative words -LRB- in comparison with neutral -RRB- , the NAC group showed PFC activations , coupled with deactivation of task-irrelevant emotional processing regions such as the amygdala and hippocampus .

22832611|The serotonin transporter-linked promoter region -LRB- 5-HTTLPR -RRB- polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene is associated with amygdala response during negative emotion .

22432955|Prior neuroimaging studies have indicated that BPD patients have -LRB- 1 -RRB- excessive amygdala activation to negative emotion and -LRB- 2 -RRB- diminished frontal regulation .

22375491|The results of a series of studies carried out in patients with focal brain lesions allow to describe the involvement of different temporal lobe regions and , in particular , of the amygdala in these emotional judgments before discussing the therapeutic benefits of music to handle Alzheimer 's disease .

21185265|Our results suggest that HCN channel activity can modulate the GABAergic synaptic transmission in the BLA , which in turn control the amygdala-related emotional behaviors such as anxiety .

21182851|Neuroimaging studies have reported greater activation of the human amygdala in response to emotional facial expressions , especially for fear .

21167644|Connectivity between 2 pairs of coupled brain regions during the cognitive and emotional tasks -LRB- prefrontal-cingulate and amygdala-cingulate -RRB- was also examined .

21167644|Furthermore , compared to controls , patients showed increased task-evoked responses in brain areas implicated in attention -LRB- eg , lateral prefrontal , inferior parietal -RRB- , emotional processes -LRB- eg , amygdala , pregenual anterior cingulate -RRB- , motor planning and performance -LRB- eg , supplementary and primary motor areas -RRB- , and activation of the default-mode network -LRB- medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate -RRB- .

21167188|The serotonin transporter gene polymorphism and the effect of baseline on amygdala response to emotional faces . .

21167188|In particular , relative to individuals homozygous for the l-allele , carriers of the s-allele display heightened amygdala activation to emotional compared to non-emotional stimuli .

21167188|Overall , these results suggest that the increased amygdala response observed in s-allele carriers to emotional faces is primarily driven by an increased response to emotional faces rather than a decreased response to neutral faces or an increased resting baseline .

21162731|Neuroplasticity in the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , particularly its latero-capsular division -LRB- CeLC -RRB- , is an important contributor to the emotional-affective aspects of pain .

21161192|To investigate this putative relationship between emotion and action , we examined the effect of an emotional stimulus on oculomotor actions controlled by the superior colliculus -LRB- SC -RRB- , which has connections with subcortical structures involved in the perceptual prioritization of emotion , such as the amygdala through the pulvinar .

21160563|The eccentricity of the emotional stimuli did not affect responses in the amygdala and no interaction effect between attentional load and spatial location was found .

21160563|We conclude that the processing of emotional stimuli in the amygdala is strongly dependent on the availability of attentional resources without a preferred processing of stimuli presented in the periphery and provide firm evidence for the concept of the attentional load theory of emotional processing in the amygdala .

21159729|Reduced amygdala activation in individuals with schizophrenia is thought to contribute to impairments in emotion recognition and social functioning .

21159729|The authors investigated amygdala modulation during emotion recognition in patients by manipulating the gaze direction of threat-related expressions .

21159729|Analysis of percent signal change in the amygdala bilaterally revealed a three-way interaction of emotion , gaze , and group , demonstrating significantly reduced amygdala responses to direct-gaze anger expressions in the patient group but comparable levels of activation across groups in all other conditions .

21159729|These findings extend previous reports of amygdala hypoactivation in schizophrenia by identifying abnormal amygdala modulation in response to varying emotional stimuli .

21152341|These functional abnormalities in social phobic patients extend beyond emotion-related brain areas , such as the amygdala , to include cortical networks that modulate attention and process other facial features , and they are also associated with an alteration of the task-related activation/deactivation trade-off .

21148006|Recent evidence suggests that putting feelings into words activates the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- and suppresses the response of the amygdala , potentially helping to alleviate emotional distress .

21148006|Manually prescribed regions of interest for the left amygdala were used to extract percentage signal change in this region occurring during the contrast of label emotion versus match forms .

21145923|Many researchers have proposed an emotion regulation circuit that includes the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala .

21145923|These results suggest that briefly presented emotion stimuli access the fast route of emotion recognition perhaps via the amygdala .

21134387|Limbic areas in the amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus demonstrated a stronger activation for the identity than the emotion condition .

21134387|One explanation for this finding is that the repetitive presentation of faces with different identities but the same emotional expression during the identity-task is responsible for the stronger increase in BOLD signal in the amygdala .

21130145|Within the brain , the amygdala is an important area involved in processing emotional responses such as anxiety .

21130141|The functional connectivity between amygdala and extrastriate visual cortex activity during emotional picture processing depends on stimulus novelty . .

21130141|Enhanced perceptual processing of emotional stimuli may be accomplished via amygdala-back-projections into the inferior temporal cortex .

21130141|The amygdala showed stronger activation to emotional arousing stimuli that decreased rapidly when the same pictures were presented repeatedly .

21130141|Emotional modulation of the amygdala was reinstated when novel emotional and neutral pictures were presented .

21130141|ITC and amygdala activity were highly correlated only during processing of novel emotional pictures .

21130141|Therefore , we concluded that enhanced perceptual processing of emotional stimuli is triggered by an initial significance detection and corresponding feedback information by the amygdala but is maintained by other mechanisms .

21127721|While studies among adults implicate the amygdala and interconnecting brain regions in encoding emotional stimuli , few studies have examined whether developmental changes occur within this emotional-memory network during adolescence .

21127721|The present study examined whether adolescents and adults differentially engaged the amygdala and hippocampus during successful encoding of emotional pictures , with either positive or negative valence .

21124739|The allocation of attention modulates negative emotional processing in the amygdala .

21124739|However , the role of passive exposure time to emotional signals in the modulation of amygdala activity during active task performance has not been examined .

21123853|A number of studies have demonstrated under-recruitment of the amygdala in response to emotional stimuli , while others have shown intact recruitment of this region .

21123853|To date , there have been few attempts to synthesize this literature using quantitative criteria or to use a formal meta-analytic approach to examine which variables may moderate the magnitude of between-group differences in amygdala activation in response to aversive emotional stimuli .

21123853|However , present findings indicate that this under-recruitment is dependent on the use of a neutral vs emotion interaction contrast and is not apparent if amygdala activation by patients and controls is evaluated in a negative emotional condition only .

21115377|A phasic glutamatergic excitatory pathway from the central amygdala to the SLD PS-on neurons activated during emotion would induce such activation .

21111837|Our results showing emotional blunting and hypersensitivity to negative emotional situations in symptomatic tgHD animals extend the face validity of this model regarding neuropsychiatric symptoms as seen in manifest HD patients , and suggest that some of these symptoms may be related to amygdala dysfunction .

21111828|In addition , unpredictable threat led to transient activity in the ventral amygdala-hippocampal area and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex , as well as transient activation and subsequent deactivation of subgenual anterior cingulate cortex , limbic structures that have been implicated in the regulation of emotional behavior and stress responses .

21109253|First , the PTSD group showed greater recruitment of the amygdala/hippocampus during the construction of negative versus positive emotionally intense AMs , when compared to controls .

21106812|On the group level , patients were able to downregulate negative emotions and corresponding amygdala activation , but this ability decreased with increasing symptom severity .

21095066|The amygdala is a main candidate for the emotional area , and the hypothalamus for the corporal area , but other areas may also provide those inputs .

21094178|In this paper , we review key polymorphisms linked to emotional and mnemonic processing and their influence on neuromodulator activity in the amygdala and other emotion-related structures .

21093597|The central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- is traditionally portrayed in fear conditioning as the key neural output that relays conditioned information established in the basolateral amygdala complex to extra-amygdalar brain structures that generate emotional responses .

21093547|PP1 is abundant in brain structures involved in emotional processing like the amygdala , it may therefore be involved in the regulation of fear memory , a form of memory related to post-traumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- in human .

21093547|Our results underscore the importance of nuclear PP1 in the amygdala as an epigenetic regulator of emotional memory , and the relevance of protein phosphatases as potential targets for therapeutic treatment of brain disorders like PTSD .

21093462|The amygdala is a temporal lobe structure that is the center of emotion processing in the mammalian brain .

21088708|Several studies have investigated the neural responses triggered by emotional pictures , but the specificity of the involved structures such as the amygdala or the ventral striatum is still under debate .

21084688|The basal amygdala -LRB- BA -RRB- plays a key role in mediating the facilitating effects of emotions on memory .

21081170|In the social neuroscience of face processing , multiple roles are attributed to amygdala : signalling of fear/threat-stimuli , of emotional expression , and general salience .

21081170|The current study aimed at a direct comparison of amygdala activation attributable to these conditions by contrasting amygdala responses to matched emotional -LRB- threatening and non-threatening -RRB- and of non-emotional salient faces in a visual search paradigm using cartoon faces .

21081170|While significant amygdala activation was obtained for all trials with salient faces -LRB- compared to those containing only non-target faces -RRB- , no significant differences in activation emerged between emotional threatening , emotional non-threatening , and non-emotional targets .

21061852|Irrespective of whether volunteers were sleep deprived , negative emotional -LRB- relative to neutral -RRB- distracters elicited greater maintenance-related activity in the amygdala , ventrolateral prefrontal cortex , and fusiform gyri , while concurrently depressing activity in cognitive control regions .

21061852|Individuals who maintained or increased distracter-related amygdala activation after sleep deprivation showed increased working memory disruptions by negative emotional distracters .

21061852|These individuals also showed reduced functional connectivity between the amygdala and the ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices , regions postulated to mediate cognitive control against emotional distraction .

21061852|Increased distraction by emotional stimuli following sleep deprivation is accompanied by increases in amygdala activation and reduced functional connectivity between the amygdala and prefrontal cognitive control regions .

21059913|The amygdala is a sexually dimorphic brain region critical for the regulation of social , cognitive , and emotional behaviors , but both the nature and the source of sex differences in the amygdala are largely unknown .

21055874|Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a thermal pain paradigm we show that practitioners of Zen , compared to controls , reduce activity in executive , evaluative and emotion areas during pain -LRB- prefrontal cortex , amygdala , hippocampus -RRB- .

21048119|The lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- plays a key role in emotional learning and is the main site for sensory input into the amygdala .

21042209|The physiologic role played by this latter region in the coordination of autonomic responses to fear-induced emotional changes raises the question as to whether the involvement of amygdala in PS might elicit a disconnection between subjective symptoms and neurovegetative signs .

21042209|These findings suggest that the limited involvement of amygdala and hippocampus in PS triggers the repertoire of fear-related sympathetic responses uncoupled from alterations in emotional status .

21041607|During affect labeling , participants recruited the dorsal inferior frontal gyrus and exhibited decreased amygdala activity , consistent with successful emotion regulation ; there was no group difference in this effect .

21041200|Both strategies were successful in reducing subjective emotional state ratings and lowered activity in the bilateral amygdala .

21041200|Functional connectivity patterns of the amygdala activation confirmed the roles of these specific activations for the 2 emotion regulation strategies .

21039484|In an emotional faces task designed to constrain group differences in attention , the present study used functional MRI to characterize activation in the amygdala , ventral prefrontal cortex -LRB- vPFC -RRB- , and striatum , three structures involved in socio-emotional processing in adolescents with ASD .

20978908|This finding supports the contemporary paradigm shift extending the amygdala 's role from dominantly processing negative emotional stimuli to processing socially relevant ones .

20975662|Differential striatal and thalamic deactivation in bipolar disorder is interpreted as a loss of amygdala -LRB- emotional brain -RRB- modulation by the ventrolateral prefrontal-subcortical circuit , which interferes with attentional maintenance .

20974959|During emotional processing , the functional connectivity between the voice area , the amygdala , and the hypothalamus was selectively enhanced in the context of blue illumination , which shows that responses to emotional stimulation in the hypothalamus and amygdala are influenced by both the decoding of vocal information in the voice area and the spectral quality of ambient light .

20974266|Further analyses revealed that , independent of emotional valence congruency , the left amygdala was consistently activated when the information from both modalities was emotional .

20974266|If a neutral stimulus was present in one modality and emotional in the other , activation in the left amygdala was significantly attenuated .

20974266|Furthermore in audiovisual pairing amygdala responses seem to signal also the absence of any neutral feature rather than only the presence of an emotionally charged one .

20971474|Children and adults displayed differing patterns of increased anterior cingulate cortex and decreased amygdala activation during episodes in which emotion regulation was required .

20971474|We found reliable increases in effective connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex and the amygdala during periods of increased demand for emotion regulation .

20971127|Given the importance of the amygdaloid complex in emotional behavior , we hypothesized that this brain area may play a pivotal role in decreasing social isolation-induced aggression .

20970421|Activation of GluR2-expressing non-calcium-permeable AMPA-type glutamate receptors in the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- may play an important role in integrating emotion and memory with goal-directed behaviors involved in opioid addiction .

20956301|Mouse Ahi1 protein is abundant in the hypothalamus and amygdala , which are important brain regions for controlling emotion .

20955802|Resting activity in ACC and insula as well as their coupling were strongly enhanced by preceding emotions , while coupling between ventral-medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala was selectively reduced .

20955766|The amygdala plays a critical role in determining the emotional significance of sensory stimuli and the production of fear-related responses .

20951152|Previous studies have implicated the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis , central nucleus of the amygdala and the shell of the nucleus accumbens -LRB- collectively called the extended amygdala -RRB- as playing an important role in mediating the aversive emotion associated with opioid withdrawal .

20951152|The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus -LRB- PVT -RRB- provides a very dense input to the extended amygdala , and the PVT is densely innervated by orexin neurons , which appear to be involved in producing some of the physical and emotional effects associated with morphine withdrawal .

20948583|Research on emotion has considered the pulvinar to be an important component of a subcortical pathway conveying visual information to the amygdala in a largely '' automatic '' fashion .

20946960|The amygdala plays a key role in emotional processing .

20946960|The specific contribution of the amygdala during the experience of one 's own emotion , however , remains controversial and requires clarification .

20946960|There is a long-standing debate on hemispheric lateralization of emotional processes , yet few studies to date directly investigated differential activation patterns for the left and right amygdala .

20946960|Limited evidence supports right amygdala involvement in automatic processes of emotion and left amygdala involvement in conscious and cognitively controlled emotion processing .

20946960|The left amygdala showed augmented activity with higher intensity ratings of negative emotional valence .

20946960|Thus , the central role of the amygdala may not be restricted to the perception of emotion in others but also extend into processes involved in regulation of mood .

20943906|Haploinsufficiency in peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase leads to altered synaptic transmission in the amygdala and impaired emotional responses . .

20943906|The mammalian amygdala expresses various neuropeptides whose signaling has been implicated in emotionality .

20943906|In the present study , we evaluated emotionality and examined molecular and cellular responses that characterize neurophysiological differences in the PAM -LRB- + / - -RRB- amygdala .

20943906|These physiological findings represent perturbations in the PAM -LRB- + / - -RRB- amygdala that may underlie the aberrant emotional responses in the intact animal .

20939663|Emerging evidence from literature on humans suggests the valence of emotionally laden environmental stimuli may dictate whether amygdala activation is greater in one hemisphere relative to the contralateral side .

20937394|The pregenual ACC and the FI , together with other regions , such as the amygdala , were preferentially activated in response to fearful face priming , suggesting that these regions are involved in the rapid processing of salient facial emotional information .

20934190|First , prior to treatment and relative to controls , patients exhibited overall reduced activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- , diminished discrimination between emotional and neutral items in the amygdala , caudate , and hippocampus , and enhanced responses to negative versus positive stimuli in the left anterior temporal lobe -LRB- ATL -RRB- and right dorsolateral PFC. Second , CBT-related symptom improvement in MDD patients was predicted by increased activity at baseline in ventromedial PFC as well as the valence effects in the ATL and dorsolateral PFC. Third , from pre - to post-treatment , MDD patients exhibited overall increases in ventromedial PFC activation , enhanced arousal responses in the amygdala , caudate , and hippocampus , and a reversal of valence effects in the ATL .

20933529|Modulating amygdala responses to emotion : evidence from pharmacological fMRI . .

20933529|In particular , emotional responding of the amygdala has become a central interest , and pharmacological fMRI has been used to specifically probe , and modulate , amygdala activation in response to facial expressions of emotion and emotionally laden scenes .

20933525|Given its contribution to the integration of emotion , perception and cognition -LRB- including memory for past autobiographical events -RRB- the amygdala also forges the establishment and maintenance of an integrated self .

20933525|With respect to memory processing , we propose that the amygdala 's role is to charge cues so that mnemonic events of a specific emotional significance can be successfully searched within the appropriate neural nets and re-activated .

20920513|For example , decision-making is believed to involve areas of the brain involved in emotion -LRB- e.g. , amygdala , ventromedial prefrontal cortex -RRB- and memory -LRB- e.g. , hippocampus , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -RRB- .

20920513|Decades of research have shown that the amygdala is involved in associating a stimulus with its emotional value .

20920513|This tradition has been extended in newer work , which has shown that the amygdala is especially important for decision-making , by triggering autonomic responses to emotional stimuli , including monetary reward and punishment .

20920513|We have posited that the amygdala is part of an '' impulsive , '' habit type system that triggers emotional responses to immediate outcomes .

20920512|The human amygdala is known to be involved in processing social , emotional , and reward-related information .

20889144|A specialized projection from pOFC to the intercalated masses of the amygdala is poised to flexibly affect autonomic responses in emotional arousal or return to homeostasis .

20889144|The amygdala projects to the magnocellular mediodorsal thalamic nucleus , which projects most robustly to pOFC among prefrontal cortices , suggesting sequential processing for emotions .

20888872|The findings contribute to previous findings that revealed abnormal activities of emotion-related regions including the amygdala and insular cortex during facial perception in SAD .

20877429|Two recent studies acquired millisecond-level data to investigate the timing of emotion and attention effects in the amygdala -LRB- Luo et al. , 2010 ; Pourtois et al. , 2010 -RRB- .

20869375|The neural correlates of emotion processing have been shown to vary with age : older adults -LRB- OAs -RRB- exhibit increased frontal activations and , under some circumstances , decreased amygdala activations relative to young adults -LRB- YAs -RRB- during emotion processing .

20869375|fMRI results reveal that emotion-related activity in the amygdala is preserved in aging and insensitive to elaboration demands .

20869122|Previous research has indicated that symptom severity and amygdala reactivity during the viewing of facial expressions of emotion are related in depression .

20840167|Stress and sex hormones help to mediate adaptive structural plasticity , which has been extensively investigated in the hippocampus and to a lesser extent in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala , all brain regions that are involved in cognitive and emotional functions .

20855060|Previous research has highlighted the role of the amygdala and its interactions with the hippocampus in mediating the effect of enhanced memory for emotional information in healthy individuals .

20855060|Exaggerated amygdala activation during the encoding of emotionally negative stimuli in PTSD is related to symptom severity and to hippocampal activation .

20851164|Healthy adults carrying the short -LRB- S -RRB- allele of the human serotonin transporter gene linked polymorphism -LRB- 5-HTTLPR -RRB- show increased amygdala activation during visual processing of emotionally negative stimuli compared to healthy adults homozygous for the long -LRB- L -RRB- allele .

20846328|Furthermore , the present data provide evidence for potentially robust trans-thalamic -LRB- via magnocellular MD -RRB- afferent , as well as direct and reciprocal , amygdaloid connections of areas 45A and 45B , suggesting the contribution of emotional information to the differential role of these two areas in non-spatial information processing .

20843875|Abnormally reduced dorsomedial prefrontal cortical activity and effective connectivity with amygdala in response to negative emotional faces in postpartum depression . .

20843875|The authors examined activity in response to negative emotional faces in the dorsomedial pre-frontal cortex and amygdala , key emotion regulatory neural regions of importance to both mothering and depression .

20843875|Reduced amygdala activity in response to negative emotional faces is associated with greater postpartum depression severity and more impaired maternal attachment processes in postpartum depressed mothers .

20833253|Together , these findings suggest that animals that are more vulnerable to stress differ in the intracellular mechanisms that control GABA-A receptor trafficking in limbic structures -LRB- hippocampus and amygdala -RRB- , which are involved in the control of emotional behaviour .

20832497|Localization of emotional learning in the amygdala and discrete motor learning in the cerebellum provides empirical means to study the mechanisms mediating the interaction between fast emotional and slow motor learning .

20832497|This facilitatory effect of the amygdala may be conceptualized under the ` two-stage theory of learning ' , which predicts that emotional learning in the first stage accelerates the motor learning in the second stage .

20831946|This has lead to the characterization of a third division of the chemosensory amygdala , the mixed chemosensory amygdala , providing a new perspective of how chemosensory information is processed in the amygdaloid complex , in particular in relation to emotional behaviors .

20818541|Previous studies have stressed the importance of the right amygdala for discriminating facial emotional expressions and for classical conditioning .

20809213|Whole-brain analysis showed significant group × emotion interactions in a right amygdala-hippocampal region and left fronto-striatal cortex .

20808182|Furthermore , among stressed men viewing angry faces , brain regions involved in interpreting and understanding others ' emotions -LRB- the insula , temporal pole , and inferior frontal gyrus -RRB- showed reduced coordination with the fusiform face area and the amygdala , whereas the functional connectivity among these regions increased with stress for women .

20807058|Voluntary explicit versus involuntary conceptual memory are associated with dissociable fMRI responses in hippocampus , amygdala , and parietal cortex for emotional and neutral word pairs . .

20805682|These components are implemented by a complex network of distributed , often recursively connected , interacting neural regions including the superior temporal sulcus , insula , medial and orbitofrontal cortices , amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex , as well as autonomic and neuroendocrine processes implicated in social behaviors and emotional states .

20805537|Relative to low-anxiety -LRB- LA -RRB- subjects , high-anxiety -LRB- HA -RRB- subjects showed greater amygdala activity to task-relevant emotional information and impaired performance and greater conflict-related activity in the dACC when emotional content was task-irrelevant .

20800687|While functional neuroimaging studies have focused on memory for emotional but not for neutral stimuli , in order to probe amygdala function , structural imaging studies have tied episodic memory to hippocampal function .

20740648|Particularly , a higher MD of the left amygdala , reflecting a decreased microstructural integrity , was associated with shorter dream reports and lower scores on emotional load .

20732901|The amygdala was also activated by emotion .

20732901|Furthermore , emotion increased functional connectivity between the vACC and activity in the amygdala and the dACC .

20729768|Sex differences in the correlation of emotional control and amygdala volumes in adolescents . .

20729768|We examined male and female adolescents -LRB- 8-18 years of age -RRB- that were scanned with structural brain MRI and looked for a correlation between volume of the right or the left amygdala and parent-reported ability of emotional control .

20729768|A sex difference was found in the correlation between emotional control and the corrected volume of the left amygdala -LRB- that is the amygdala volume adjusted for total cranial volume -RRB- .

20729768|In girls , smaller left amygdala volumes were associated with better emotional control .

20729768|In boys , larger left amygdala volumes were associated with better emotional control .

20729768|These findings suggest that healthy girls and boys show a difference in the correlation between parental reports of emotional control and the left amygdala volume .

20727904|Dysfunction of the amygdala and hippocampus in early AD may impair recollection , but AD did not disrupt the effect of emotion on false recollection judgments .

20720535|In a functional magnetic resonance imaging study utilizing a double-blind placebo-controlled within-subjects design , we measured amygdala activation to an emotional face matching task of fearful , angry , and happy faces following acute intranasal administration of OXT -LRB- 24 IU or 40.32 ?g -RRB- and placebo in 18 GSAD and 18 CON subjects .

20720535|Both the CON and GSAD groups activated bilateral amygdala to all emotional faces during placebo , with the GSAD group exhibiting hyperactivity specifically to fearful faces in bilateral amygdala compared with the CON group .

20720535|OXT had no effect on amygdala activity to emotional faces in the CON group , but attenuated the heightened amygdala reactivity to fearful faces in the GSAD group , such that the hyperactivity observed during the placebo session was no longer evident following OXT -LRB- ie , normalization -RRB- .

20716480|The amygdala is the central region devoted to the processing of emotional valence and its sub-nuclei including the baso-lateral and centro-medial are organized in a relative hierarchy of affective processing .

20715084|Emotion triggers executive attention : anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala responses to emotional words in a conflict task . .

20715084|In response to conflict , we found activation of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- and of the amygdala for emotional stimuli .

20714708|The goal of the present study was to investigate whether juvenile stress influences emotional control via postsynaptic 5-HT -LRB- 1A -RRB- receptor in the hippocampus and amygdala using contextual fear conditioning test in adult rats .

20708906|Fifteen MDD patients and 15 matched healthy controls were scanned using fMRI during the performance of an emotional face task known to robustly activate the amygdala and prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- .

20708906|The current study replicates previous research on unmedicated subjects showing no significant differences in amygdala function in depressed vs. control subjects with respect to simple tasks involving emotion observation .

20703221|Positive correlations were found between attentional bias and reactivity to smoking images in brain areas involved in emotion , memory , interoception , and visual processing , including the amygdala , hippocampus , parahippocampal gyrus , insula , and occipital cortex .

20696168|IBS patients differed from controls in that there were more consistent activations in regions associated with emotional arousal -LRB- pregenual anterior cingulate cortex , amygdala -RRB- and activation of a midbrain cluster , a region playing a role in endogenous pain modulation .

20693390|These results suggest that a negative impression from face may be formed by orchestrated activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex , dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala , and that the activity has a prominent role in the initial acquisition of negative emotion .

20688087|In particular , we propose that the amygdala interacts with these structures to promote enhancements in perceptual processing , semantic elaboration , and attention , which serve to benefit subsequent memory for emotional material .

20679212|We found that the cognitive down-regulation of craving was associated with -LRB- i -RRB- activity in regions previously associated with regulating emotion in particular and cognitive control in general , including dorsomedial , dorsolateral , and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices , and -LRB- ii -RRB- decreased activity in regions previously associated with craving , including the ventral striatum , subgenual cingulate , amygdala , and ventral tegmental area .

20676360|The ventral prefrontal cortex -LRB- VPFC -RRB- and amygdala are highly interconnected structures that jointly play a central role in emotional regulation .

20676360|Numerous research groups have reported prominent structural and functional abnormalities within the VPFC and amygdala supporting their essential role in a neural system underlying the emotional dysregulation that is a core feature of BD .

20675973|Neurological data demonstrate that emotion-processing deficits in pediatric BD involve dysfunction within a distributed fronto-striatal-limbic network , including the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex , anterior cingulate cortex , striatum , and amygdala .

20673804|Previous neuroimaging studies suggest that prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- modulation of the amygdala and related limbic structures is an underlying neural substrate of effortful emotion regulation .

20668188|Functionally , increased activity was observed in regions associated with facial expression processing , including the amygdala and fusiform gyrus during emotional awareness .

20668188|The possibility is raised that interactions between pgPFC and the amygdala , previously implicated in extinction , may also influence whether or not an emotional stimulus is accessible to consciousness .

20666145|The amygdala is a brain structure that is critically involved in the processing of memory and emotion , including fear and anxiety .

20661452|In addition , the relationship between state anxiety and gaze on emotional intensity ratings mirrored the relationship between anxiety and the amygdala/SI response .

20660101|In the amygdala , NMDA-dependent synaptic plasticity resulting from convergent somatosensory and auditory inputs contributes to emotional memory ; however , the role of Src tyrosine kinase has not been investigated .

20655508|The results of the study are consistent with the neuroplasticity hypothesis of depression , showing decreased synaptic plasticity in a dorsal executive network that comprises the hippocampus and elevated synaptic plasticity in a ventral emotional network that includes the amygdala in depression .

20655320|Association between amygdala response to emotional faces and social anxiety in autism spectrum disorders . .

20654262|Events with moderate or elevated emotional intensity are printed as important -LRB- by limbic structures like amygdala and orbito-frontal cortex -RRB- being more easily recorded .

20647384|Activation and interregional coupling of the amygdala during the processing of emotionally salient social cues was significantly affected by genotype .

20643164|Recent psychological studies suggest that the amygdala is not essential for early stages of emotional facial processing , and that the colliculo-pulvinar pathway might play this role .

20637290|Previous studies have indicated phase-related differences in HPA activity and amygdala responsiveness in women , such that the response to negative emotional images is reduced during high-estrogen phases of the menstrual cycle .

20637217|Previous research has indicated that the amygdala is a critical neural substrate of the emotional modulation of attention .

20637217|However , a recent case study suggests that the amygdala may not be essential for all types of emotion-attention interactions .

20637217|All participant groups , including those with amygdala lesions , detected emotional targets more efficiently than neutral targets .

20637217|These data indicate that the amygdala is not necessary for emotion-guided visual search and suggest that other mechanisms beyond the amygdala help guide attention toward threatening stimuli .

20630713|The response-focused emotion regulation style ` Expressive suppression ' has been associated with symptoms of lower psychological well-being and increased function magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- activation of the sublenticular extended amygdala -LRB- SLEA -RRB- in patients with major depression .

20625482|In mice , removal of Mecp2 in the forebrain recapitulates most of behavioral deficits found in global Mecp2 deficient mice , including amygdala-related hyper-anxiety and lack of social interaction , pointing a role of Mecp2 in emotional learning .

20624690|Corticotropin-releasing factor in the rat amygdala differentially influences sensory-discriminative and emotional-like pain response in peripheral neuropathy . .

20624690|An increase in free endogenous corticotropin-releasing factor in the central nucleus of the amygdala was accompanied by increased cutaneous hypersensitivity and decreased emotional painlike behavior in neuropathic animals .

20624690|This finding indicates that CRF in the amygdala may have differential effects on sensory and emotional aspects of neuropathic pain .

20621741|The amygdala , situated in the anterior medial temporal lobe -LRB- MTL -RRB- , is involved in the emotional enhancement of memory .

20619280|The amygdala is a fascinating , complex structure that lies at the center of much of our current thinking about emotion .

20616670|Unlike similar studies in younger populations , these results suggest a more significant engagement of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and less amygdala activation in emotional regulation in midlife women .

20603454|Hence , we investigated neurophysiological responses to emotional and neutral faces in regions associated with antisocial behavior -LRB- ie , the amygdala , ventromedial prefrontal cortex , insula , and orbitofrontal cortex -RRB- in individuals with EO-CD and AO-CD and in healthy control subjects .

20602430|However , the profile of amygdala activation in response to facial expressions in obsessive-compulsive disorder -LRB- OCD -RRB- may be a distinguishing feature ; a prior study found that compared with healthy adults , adults with OCD exhibited less amygdala activation to emotional and neutral faces , relative to fixation -LSB- Cannistraro et al. -LRB- 2004 -RRB- .

20602430|Compared to the HC group , the OCD group showed less amygdala/hippocampus activation in all emotion and neutral conditions relative to fixation .

20602430|Like previous reports in adult OCD , pediatric OCD may have a distinct neural profile from other anxiety disorders , with respect to amygdala activation in response to emotional stimuli that are not disorder specific .

20600336|Right prefrontal HF-rTMS attenuates right amygdala processing of negatively valenced emotional stimuli in healthy females . .

20600336|In this fMRI study , we focused on lateralized amygdala functioning when processing salient emotional visual stimuli after one high-frequency -LRB- HF -RRB- - rTMS session .

20595014|Exaggerated medial prefrontal cortical and subcortical -LRB- putamen and amygdala -RRB- responses to emotional signals may represent heritable neurobiological abnormalities underlying bipolar disorder .

26271495|These include : -LRB- 1 -RRB- a cortical-hippocampal circuit that mediates declarative memory , our capacity to recollect facts and events ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- procedural memory subsystems involving a cortical-striatal circuit that mediates habit formation and a brainstem-cerebellar circuit that mediates sensorimotor adaptations ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- a circuit involving subcortical and cortical pathways through the amygdala that mediates the attachment of affective status and emotional responses to previously neutral stimuli .

20583145|Medial temporal lobe brain structures , such as the amygdala , play an important role in the normal perception and generation of emotional behavior .

20583145|We assessed emotional behavioral responses of rhesus macaques that received bilateral ibotenic acid lesions of the amygdala or hippocampus at 2 weeks of age and sham-operated controls .

20579005|Consistent with previous studies , emotional pictures activated an emotional network including amygdala , medial prefrontal cortex , orbitofrontal cortex and occipito-temporal areas in both groups .

20573339|PTSD neuroimaging studies have identified functional differences in the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- / medial prefrontal cortex during emotion processing .

20563312|Neurobiological mechanisms for negative reinforcement , defined as drug taking that alleviates a negative emotional state , involve changes in the brain reward system and recruitment of brain stress -LRB- or antireward -RRB- systems within forebrain structures , including the extended amygdala .

20557486|Compared with soundscapes that evoked no -LRB- neutral -RRB- emotional response , those evoking a pleasant or unpleasant emotional response engaged an additional neural circuit including the right amygdala .

20555311|They underwent BOLD fMRI while performing an emotion information-processing task that activates the amygdala and two prefrontally dependent cognitive tasks-a working memory -LRB- WM -RRB- task and a variable attentional control -LRB- VAC -RRB- task .

20553618|With the intentions of identifying gene-specific expression in particular brain parts and comparing brains of aggressive and non-aggressive dogs , we studied amygdala , frontal cortex , hypothalamus and parietal cortex , as these tissues are reported to be involved in emotional reactions , including aggression .

20548294|Prolonged and site-specific over-expression of corticotropin-releasing factor reveals differential roles for extended amygdala nuclei in emotional regulation . .

20548294|These results show possible differential roles for CRF expressed by distinct loci of the extended amygdala , in mediating stress-induced emotional behaviors .

20542121|Further , while the effect of arousal on memory for positive information was restricted to amygdalar efferents , arousal had a more widespread effect for negative items , enhancing connectivity between other nodes of the emotional memory network .

20534533|The strong emotional symptoms of FXS , on the other hand , are likely to involve the amygdala .

20528979|The amygdala is a part of the limbic system that is associated with mediating the emotional and hormonal response to stress and although studies have focused on the central amygdala , there is increasing evidence that the medial amygdala is a major region activated by stressful stimuli .

20515226|Highly arousing emotions were associated with increased BOLD signal intensities in the left thalamus , globus pallidus , caudate , parahippocampal gyrus , amygdala , premotor cortex , and cerebellar vermis .

20510373|Here we investigated the impact of the COMT Val158Met polymorphism on amygdala activity and connectivity during processing of emotional and neutral pictures using functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- in 56 healthy participants .

26952802|Main findings suggest that long-term MM practice allows a more flexible emotional regulation by engaging frontal cortical structures to dampen automatic amygdala activation .

20508750|Two components were correlated with intensity ratings , including temporal lobe regions implicated in memory and emotional functions , such as the hippocampus and amygdala , as well as a midline fronto-cingulo-parietal network implicated in social cognition and self-relevant processing .

20503057|Muscarinic cholinergic neurotransmission in the basolateral nuclear complex -LRB- BLC -RRB- of the amygdala is critical for memory consolidation in emotional/motivational learning tasks .

20498341|Previous work has demonstrated that during working memory -LRB- WM -RRB- negative emotional distraction disrupts activation in the lateral prefrontal regions while also engaging the amygdala .

20498341|These results provide further evidence for an inverse relationship between dorsal prefrontal cortical regions and the amygdala when processing aversive stimuli competes with ongoing cognitive operations , and further support the importance of the prefrontal cortex in resisting emotional interference .

20494265|The amygdala and hippocampus are key components of the neural system mediating emotion perception and regulation and are thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of autism .

20491283|Using this model , the amygdala was found to be one of the most potent modulators of the mechanisms responsible for the emotional memory system .

20488680|Increased amygdala activation during automatic processing of facial emotion in schizophrenia . .

20488680|The amygdala is a central part of a brain network that is involved in the perception of facial emotions .

20488680|In the present study , we investigated the automatic responsivity of the amygdala to emotional faces in schizophrenia and its relationship to clinical symptomatology by applying an affective priming task .

20486013|In general , children showed heightened amygdala activation in response to emotional faces relative to adults .

20478833|The human amygdalae are involved in processing visual information about the eyes within faces , and play an essential role in the use of information from the eye region of the face in order to judge emotional expressions , as well as in directing gaze to the eyes in conversations with real people .

20478833|Here we investigated this question by applying the ` Bubbles ' method , which asks viewers to discriminate facial emotions from randomly sampled small regions of a face , to 23 neurological participants with focal , unilateral amygdala damage -LRB- 10 to the right amygdala -RRB- .

20478833|The findings have implications for the amygdala 's role in emotion recognition and gaze direction during face processing .

20463194|Our previous studies showed that the amygdala plays a key role in emotional-affective pain responses and pain modulation .

20459886|The amygdala plays a central role in the fronto-limbic network involved in the processing of emotions .

20459886|We therefore provide evidence that schizophrenia is associated with disrupted tissue organization of the right amygdala , despite partially preserved size , which may ultimately lead to abnormal emotional processing in schizophrenia .

20456660|Activation in some of these conjunctly activated regions was even stronger during affective ToM than during emotion recognition , namely in the inferior frontal gyrus , the superior temporal sulcus , the temporal pole , and the amygdala .

20453040|Increased amygdala activation to emotional auditory stimuli in the blind . .

20453040|While the human amygdala receives input from all sensory modalities , it is the visual modality that is most important for emotional aspects in social interactions .

20453040|Consequently , amygdala involvement in visual emotional processing has been unequivocally established , whereas its role in auditory emotional processing is less clear .

20453040|To investigate amygdala involvement in auditory emotional processing , we used functional magnetic resonance imaging in sighted and connatally blind volunteers , the latter of which lack visual experience during development but have outstanding capabilities to process auditory signals , which are their dominant source of information in social interactions .

20453040|Our results indicate that the responsivity of the amygdala to emotional signals develops even in the absence of visual emotional experience and serves the sensory modality which is the most reliable source of emotional information .

20452398|The amygdalae play an important role in the evaluation and processing of emotionally salient visual stimuli .

20452398|However , individual differences in personality traits , such as Harm Avoidance -LRB- HA -RRB- , have been reported to influence emotional amygdalae responses .

20452398|Only in withdrawal-related emotional experience , we observed a negative correlation between HA and left amygdala activity , suggesting that during passive viewing females scoring higher on HA ` avoid ' images with highly aversive content .

20452398|When investigating the amygdala 's emotional role in passive viewing paradigms , personality features such as HA should be taken into account .

20451622|MDD relative to non-MDD individuals showed greater activity during fear matching trials in the amygdala and other emotion processing structures , lower activity during fear matching trials in emotional control structures such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and lower fractional anisotropy -LRB- FA -RRB- in several white matter tracts including the superior longitudinal fasciculus -LRB- SLF -RRB- .

20445054|Ablating the Y2 gene in the basolateral and central amygdala resulted in an anxiolytic phenotype , whereas deletion in the medial amygdala or in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis had no obvious effect on emotion-related behavior .

20434632|Whereas the former process is subserved by hyperactivations in regions involved in reward evaluation such as the nucleus accumbens , the latter has been proposed to be subserved by hypoactivations in regions involved in negative emotions such as the amygdala or the insular cortex .

20427643|There has been a long controversy concerning whether the amygdala 's response to emotional stimuli is automatic or dependent on attentional load .

20427643|Using magnoencephalography and an advanced beamformer source localization technique , we found that amygdala automaticity was a function of time : while early amygdala responding to emotional stimuli -LRB- 40-140 ms -RRB- was unaffected by attentional load , later amygdala response -LRB- 280-410 ms -RRB- , subsequent to frontoparietal cortex activity , was modulated by attentional load .

20425314|The literature reveals that individuals who present with an increased risk for reactive , but not instrumental , aggression show increased amygdala responses to emotionally evocative stimuli .

20425314|In contrast , individuals with psychopathic tendencies show decreased amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex responses to emotionally provocative stimuli or during emotional learning paradigms .

20416363|Elevated response of human amygdala to neutral stimuli in mild post traumatic stress disorder : neural correlates of generalized emotional response . .

20416363|Previous evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- studies has shown that amygdala responses to emotionally neutral pictures are exaggerated at a group level in patients with severe post-traumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- -LSB- Hendler T , Rotshtein P , Yeshurun Y , Weizmann T , Kahn I , Ben-Bashat D , Malach R , Bleich A -LRB- 2003 -RRB- Neuroimage 19 -LRB- 3 -RRB- :587 -600 -RSB- .

20416363|Control subjects showed enhanced amygdala responses to emotionally negative stimuli compared to neutral stimuli .

20416363|On the contrary , PTSD patients were characterized by high amygdala responses to both neutral and emotional pictures , with no statistically significant difference between the two classes of stimuli .

20416363|Results of this study suggest that amygdala responses and the selectivity of the emotional response to neutral stimuli are elevated as a function of disease severity in PTSD patients with mild symptoms .

20403415|The dynamics of the zinc in the amygdala was analyzed in rats , which were subjected to inescapable stress , to understand the role of the zinc in emotional behavior .

20403415|In the communication box , two rats were subjected to foot shock stress and anxiety stress experiencing emotional responses of foot-shocked rat under amygdalar perfusion .

20403415|The present paper demonstrates that zinc released in the lateral amygdala may participate in emotional behavior in response to fear .

20401751|Manipulations of amygdala dopamine impact the earliest stage of learning in which emotional reactions may be most prevalent .

20400272|Among these brain areas suggested to be implicated in the modulation of motivation and of emotional states , the basolateral amygdala has a crucial role in the emergence of negative affective state during ethanol withdrawal .

20398771|Additionally , we confirmed activation of the right amygdala and right thalamus to the masked surprised faces , which was previously proved to be involved in the unconscious emotional perception system .

20392966|Normal functions of the intact amygdala and prefrontal cortex are required for emotion-based decision-making that relies on the ability to assess risk , attribute value , and identify advantageous strategies .

20392966|In contrast to the differential effects of BLA versus CeA hyperactivity on cortical-cognitive functions , both amygdala nuclei modulate emotional-affective pain behavior .

20392966|Thus , this study shows that the amygdala contributes not only to emotional-affective but also cognitive effects of pain .

20392942|Emotional processing in a salient motion context : integration of motion and emotion in both V5/hMT + and the amygdala . .

20392942|Most importantly , task salience was found to further increase amygdala 's activity when presented together with an emotional face .

20392942|Our data support a more general role of the amygdala as a behavioral relevance detector , which flexibly integrates behavioral relevant , salient context information to decode the emotional content of a visual scene .

20392275|These aspects help to clarify the amygdala 's contributions to recognizing emotion from faces , to social behavior toward conspecifics , and to reward learning and instrumental behavior .

20385663|Across both age groups , cognitive reappraisal activated prefrontal regions similar to those reported in prior studies of emotion regulation , while emotional experience activated the bilateral amygdala .

20381628|Interventions targeting the amygdalar fear memory may be essential in specifically and persistently dampening the emotional impact of fear .

20373351|These findings suggest that human narcolepsy is accompanied by abnormal emotional learning , and that , in line with animal data , the hypocretin system and the amygdala are involved in this process .

20371820|Oxytocin enhances amygdala-dependent , socially reinforced learning and emotional empathy in humans . .

20371820|Overall these findings provide the first demonstration that OT can facilitate amygdala-dependent , socially reinforced learning and emotional empathy in men .

20370668|During emotional processing , it is consistently found that ATD modulates the BOLD response in the amygdala .

20368518|In humans , low NPY expression predicts amygdala response and emotional reactivity .

20368515|Fusiform gyrus cortical thickness , amygdala volume , emotional face processing .

20368515|In light of recent evidence of the involvement of the fusiform gyrus and amygdala in social perception as well as the areas of social cognition and emotional awareness , all of which are relevant to autism , our findings might represent a core pathophysiological mechanism of autism .

20362598|Further analyses of the moral conflicts revealed that hedonistic decisions in contrast to morally guided decisions were associated with significantly higher rankings of uncertainty and unpleasant emotions and induced significant more activation in the amygdala/parahippocampal region .

20360351|In attempting to understand the mechanisms underlying this relation , we tested the hypothesis that 5-HTTLPR genotype affects the speed with which amygdala is recruited during emotional processing in young girls with no history of psychiatric disorder .

20360351|Future research should examine how exposure to negative life events and more chronic sadness modify the time course of amygdala activity during the experience of negative emotion .

20360158|Our results suggest that networks implicated in the allocation of attentional resources -LRB- VMPFC -RRB- and emotion processing -LRB- amygdala , cerebellum -RRB- are differentially affected in patients on CONV versus RLAI .

20357118|Memory formation is thought to require plasticity in synaptic circuits , and so we examined whether the memory for a drug-paired environment correlates with changes in the synaptic circuits of the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , in which emotional learning is a recognized phenomenon .

20350176|fMRI analyses revealed that the right amygdala predicted subsequent emotional memory in the shallow more than deep condition , whereas the right ventrolateral PFC demonstrated the reverse pattern .

20350176|Taken together , these results suggest two distinct activation patterns underlying emotional memory formation : an amygdala component that promotes memory during shallow encoding , especially for negative information , and a prefrontal component that provides extra benefits during deep encoding , especially for positive information .

20346351|The basolateral nuclear complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLC -RRB- receives robust sensory inputs from the rhinal cortices -LRB- RCx -RRB- that are important for the generation of emotional behavior .

20339549|For centrally presented faces , the emotions were separated fast , first in the right superior temporal sulcus -LRB- STS ; 35-48 ms -RRB- , followed by the right amygdala -LRB- 57-64 ms -RRB- and medial pre-frontal cortex -LRB- 83-96 ms -RRB- .

20339549|For faces presented in the periphery , the emotions were separated first in the ipsilateral amygdala and contralateral STS .

20331984|These results suggest that amygdalar and hippocampal volumes assessed using MRI may be a useful intermediate phenotype that will uncover the biological pathway linking 5-HT synthesis and emotional behaviors and affective disorders .

20331854|Besides the amygdala , of which emotion roles have been intensively studied , the cerebellum has also been demonstrated to play a critical role in simple classical fear conditioning in both mammals and fishes .

20331363|Neuroscientists have often described cognition and emotion as separable processes implemented by different regions of the brain , such as the amygdala for emotion and the prefrontal cortex for cognition .

20331363|In this framework , functional interactions between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex mediate emotional influences on cognitive processes such as decision-making , as well as the cognitive regulation of emotion .

20308198|The model comprises abnormalities in oxytocinergic and dopaminergic signaling in the amygdala that result in impaired emotional salience processing with consequent social cognitive deficits .

20303069|The participants who reported the largest increase in pain unpleasantness after the sad mood induction showed greater inferior frontal gyrus and amygdala activation , linking changes in emotion regulation mechanisms with enhancement of pain affect .

20299811|In addition , neuroimaging studies in BPD patients indicate differences in the volume and activity of specific brain regions related to emotion and impulse control , such as the prefrontal and cingulate cortex , amygdala and hippocampus .

20237266|Memory enhancement for emotional events is dependent on amygdala activation and noradrenergic modulation during learning .

20236805|Behavioral control , including both over - and under-control , is likely to be subserved by neural circuitry associated with emotion regulation including the right OFC and the amygdala .

20233962|Results imply that depression , particularly when accompanied by anxious arousal , may result in a failure to implement top-down processing by appropriate brain regions -LRB- left DLPFC , right IFG -RRB- due to increased activation in regions associated with responding to emotionally salient information -LRB- right DLPFC , amygdala -RRB- .

20233957|Temporal precedence of emotion over attention modulations in the lateral amygdala : Intracranial ERP evidence from a patient with temporal lobe epilepsy . .

20233957|Previous fMRI studies have reported mixed evidence for the influence of selective attention on amygdala responses to emotional stimuli , with some studies showing '' automatic '' emotional effects to threat-related stimuli without attention -LRB- or even without awareness -RRB- , but other studies showing a gating of amygdala activity by selective attention with no response to unattended stimuli .

20233957|Our results revealed an early emotional effect in the amygdala arising prior to , and independently of , attentional modulation .

20233957|These results suggest separate influences of emotion and attention on amygdala activation and may help reconcile previous discrepancies concerning the relative responsiveness of the human amygdala to emotional and attentional factors .

20233954|Relative to comparison youths , youths with a history of caregiver deprivation and emotional neglect showed significantly greater left amygdala and left anterior hippocampus activation during the processing of threatening information .

20227444|In the first part of the review the neuroanatomical and neurochemical foundations of the interaction between brain areas generating emotions , such as the amygdala , and those allowing the association of multi-dimensional stimuli into an episodic memory , such as the hippocampus , are delineated .

20226766|Neurones in the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- projecting to the caudal dorsomedial medulla oblongata play a key role in the autonomic expression of emotional behaviour .

20222060|We provide a neurobiological model of adolescence that proposes an imbalance in the development of subcortical limbic -LRB- e.g. , amygdala -RRB- relative to prefrontal cortical regions as a potential mechanism for heightened emotionality during this period .

20211695|These between-strain differences seem to depend on strain differences in emotionality , given that : -LRB- i -RRB- they are abolished by IP administration of the GABAergic anxiolytic diazepam -LRB- Torres et al. -LSB- 32 -RSB- -RRB- and -LRB- ii -RRB- avoidance responding appears to correlate with cellular density in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- Gómez et al. -LSB- 9 -RSB- -RRB- .

20205498|Overlapping biological processes including amygdala hyperreactivity , volume changes in subgenual anterior cingulate cortex , and deficient serotonergic function appear to underlie emotional dysregulation in both disorders .

20204074|Results showed that increased saliency of emotion-specific acoustic cues was associated with increased activation in superior temporal cortex -LSB- planum temporale -LRB- PT -RRB- , posterior superior temporal gyrus -LRB- pSTG -RRB- , and posterior superior middle gyrus -LRB- pMTG -RRB- -RSB- and amygdala , whereas decreased saliency of acoustic cues was associated with increased inferior frontal activity and temporo-frontal connectivity .

20204074|Auditory regions may thus integrate acoustic information with amygdala input to form emotion-specific representations , which are evaluated within inferior frontal regions .

20194512|The changing face of emotion : age-related patterns of amygdala activation to salient faces . .

20194512|This study presents novel data on neural correlates of face processing in childhood and indicates that preferential amygdala activation for emotional expressions changes with age .

20191578|The distinctive metabolic features found in the right amygdala of patients with FM suggest the possible existence of a neural dysfunction in emotional processing .

20189956|The interaction between amygdala-driven and hippocampus-driven activities is expected to explain why emotion enhances episodic memory recognition .

20188516|Emotion regulation processes , such as reappraisal , are thought to operate through interactions between prefrontal emotion-control regions and subcortical emotion-generation regions such as the amygdala .

20185282|The medial extended amygdala modulates pheromonal perception , influencing emotional and social behavior .

20184808|In response to emotional faces , those in the ASD group showed greater right amygdala activation than those in the control group .

20184808|When attention bias to emotional faces was equivalent between ASD and control groups , ASD was associated with greater amygdala activation .

20184808|Preliminary analyses showed that ASD participants had stronger connectivity between the amygdala ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- a network implicated in emotional modulation -RRB- and weaker connectivity between the amygdala and temporal lobe -LRB- a pathway involved in the identification of facial expressions , although areas of group differences were generally in a more anterior region of the temporal lobe than what is typically reported for emotional face processing -RRB- .

20183549|We investigate the performance of a patient , HS , with a unilateral lesion to the left temporal pole and orbito-frontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- -LRB- including left amygdala -RRB- , on a well-established approach/avoid task that taps into emotion-driven action .

20183549|This finding suggests that the left temporal lobe and OFC structures , including the amygdala , appear to be involved in the action component of emotion , specifically in avoiding negative items .

20183113|The amygdala-the brain structure responsible for processing emotion and anxiety-demonstrates plasticity , and the purpose of therapy may be to allow the cortex to establish more effective and efficient synaptic links with the amygdala .

20176860|Individuals with schizophrenia showed intact amygdala activity in response to emotionally evocative stimuli , but demonstrated altered dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- and hippocampal activity while performing an emotionally loaded WM-task .

20176860|Higher levels of social anhedonia were associated with diminished amygdala responses to emotional stimuli and increased DLPFC activity in individuals with schizophrenia .

20170666|The amygdala is important for integrating the emotional , endocrine and autonomic responses to stress .

20159144|Abnormal left and right amygdala-orbitofrontal cortical functional connectivity to emotional faces : state versus trait vulnerability markers of depression in bipolar disorder . .

20159144|Effects of group , laterality , and emotion intensity upon amygdala-OFC FC and amygdala-OFC FC white matter fractional anisotropy -LRB- FA -RRB- relationships were examined .

20158678|Augmented amygdala involvement in patients reflects general emotional hyperarousal .

20156568|Recent findings have suggested that the hypothalamus plays a role beyond mere control of HPA-axis function ; this is also supported by the existence of rich anatomical connections between the hypothalamus and the amygdala , a region known for its important role in emotional processing .

20154357|We examined the roles of the amygdala and hippocampus in the formation of emotionally relevant memories using an ethological model of conditioned fear termed conditioned defeat -LRB- CD -RRB- .

20153402|The amygdala is a key structure in the brain 's emotional system and in recent years the crucial importance of the amygdala in drug-seeking and relapse has been increasingly recognized .

20152109|Strikingly , gene expression in the dorsal hippocampus correlates with cortical regions involved in information processing , while genes expressed in the ventral hippocampus correlate with regions involved in emotion and stress -LRB- amygdala and hypothalamus -RRB- .

20148438|The amygdaloid complex -LRB- AC -RRB- , a key component of the limbic system , is a brain region critical for the detection and interpretation of emotionally salient information .

20148438|Because we have included quantitative comparisons with great apes and humans , our conclusions apply to human brains , and our scaling laws can potentially be used to study the anatomical correlates of the amygdala in disorders involving pathological emotion processing .

20148332|During acquisition , fMRI results showed increased activation for the conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS + -LRB- unpaired -RRB- -RRB- when compared with the non-conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS - -RRB- in the right amygdala , the insulae , the anterior cingulate cortex and the parahippocampal gyrus , all regions known to be involved in emotional processing .

20147457|The regulation of negative emotion through reappraisal has been shown to induce increased prefrontal activity and decreased amygdala activity .

20147457|Notably , this prefrontal activation was inversely correlated with the amygdala response to negative scenes , further supporting its role in down-regulating emotion-generation regions .

20141730|Combining the TCM theory with the modern psychological theory on stress , and from the points of views of the emotion regulation , the formation , consolidation , extraction and extinction of fear memory , and the plasticity of amygdala-hippocampus-prefrontal cortex nervous pathway , as well as the results of pharmacological studies of prescriptions and herbs for invigorating the kidney , the authors explained in this article the pathological mechanisms of kidney deficiency due to attack of fear , and revealed the material basis , the action modes , and the neurobiological mechanisms of the kidney in controlling and regulating emotional activity .

20141305|During the breath-focused attention task -LRB- but not the distraction-focused attention task -RRB- , they also showed -LRB- a -RRB- decreased negative emotion experience , -LRB- b -RRB- reduced amygdala activity , and -LRB- c -RRB- increased activity in brain regions implicated in attentional deployment .

20141298|Similarly , when viewing emotional faces , amygdala reactivity was positively correlated with depressive symptomatology and negatively correlated with dispositional mindfulness , an effect that was largely attributable to differences in resting activity .

20127869|Research on emotional perception and learning indicates appetitive cues engage nucleus accumbens -LRB- NAc -RRB- and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- , whereas amygdala activity is modulated by the emotional intensity of appetitive and aversive cues .

20127869|NAc and mPFC activity were each correlated with the rated pleasure of the imagined scenes , while amygdala activity was correlated with rated emotional arousal .

20123913|Failure of anterior cingulate activation and connectivity with the amygdala during implicit regulation of emotional processing in generalized anxiety disorder . .

20123913|The authors recently reported that in healthy volunteers the pregenual anterior cingulate regulates emotional conflict on a trial-by-trial basis by dampening activity in the amygdala .

20123913|By contrast , patients with generalized anxiety disorder were completely unable to regulate emotional conflict and failed to engage the pregenual anterior cingulate in ways that would dampen amygdalar activity .

20122966|The amygdala , the anterior insula , the STS , and the OFC showed increased activation during processing of emotional as well as social stimuli independent of the sensory modality in which the stimuli were presented .

20121862|Prolonged institutional rearing is associated with atypically large amygdala volume and difficulties in emotion regulation . .

20121862|Late adoption was associated with larger corrected amygdala volumes , poorer emotion regulation , and increased anxiety .

20121862|The findings are consistent with previous reports describing negative effects of prolonged orphanage care on emotional behavior and with animal models that show long-term changes in the amygdala and emotional behavior following early postnatal stress .

20120731|In order to reveal characteristics of functioning of amygdalar neuronal network during unconditioned fear , firing patterns of basal and central nuclear neurons and their interaction were studied during freezing -LRB- fear -RRB- , active unconditioned motor reactions -LRB- in the absence of fear -RRB- to emotionally significant stimuli , and during quiet wakefulness .

20097294|Recent animal studies suggest that BDNF mediates memory for emotional experiences in the amygdala , but it is currently unknown whether BDNF Val66Met influences memory processing in the amygdala .

20097232|Influence of amygdaloid glutamatergic receptors on sensory and emotional pain-related behavior in the neuropathic rat . .

20097232|The role of amygdaloid glutamatergic receptors -LRB- GluRs -RRB- in maintenance of the sensory versus emotional component of neuropathic pain was studied by assessing monofilament-induced limb withdrawal response -LRB- sensory pain -RRB- and aversive place-conditioning behavior -LRB- emotional pain -RRB- following amygdaloid administration of various glutamatergic compounds in nerve-injured animals .

20097232|The results indicate that endogenous activation of amygdaloid group I metabotropic GluRs , mGluR -LRB- 1 -RRB- and mGluR -LRB- 5 -RRB- , and the NMDA-R contributes to maintenance of sensory and emotional components of neuropathic pain .

20097232|The predominant effect by amygdaloid group I mGluRs was facilitation of emotional-like pain behavior .

20096793|Neuroimaging studies suggest that the amygdala integrates emotional expression and gaze direction , but the findings are inconsistent .

20096793|We hypothesized that the dynamic facial expressions , which are more salient stimuli than static facial expressions are , would reveal the integration of emotional expression and gaze direction in amygdala activity .

20096793|These results suggest that the amygdala integrates emotional expression and gaze direction in dynamic facial expressions and modulates emotional arousal .

20095437|Brain activation in the PFC and functional connectivity between the PFC and amygdala on receiving negative emotional stimuli were weakened after CBT .

20093991|We used functional magnetic resonance imaging at 1.5-T field strength to determine whether amygdala responses to emotional pictures would predict performance on an immediate recognition memory test .

20079775|Although we could not find correlations between recognition performance and activity of these three regions , we speculate that the right hippocampus may integrate the effects of emotion -LRB- processed in the amygdala -RRB- and monetary reward -LRB- processed in the orbitofrontal cortex -RRB- on episodic memory encoding .

20071145|Unlike control subjects and non-hallucinators , the group of hallucinatory patients showed an increase of activity in the parahippocampal gyrus and the amygdala during the emotional session .

20071145|These findings may reflect an increase in parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala activity during passive listening of emotional words in patients with schizophrenia and auditory hallucinations .

20064939|TP has been implicated in different cognitive functions such as emotion , attention , behavior , and memory , based on functional studies performed in healthy controls and patients with neurodegenerative diseases through its anatomical connections -LRB- amygdala , pulvinar , orbitofrontal cortex -RRB- .

20056024|Region-of-interest analysis of functional brain imaging data revealed no difference between groups during aToM , but a hyperactivation in the schizophrenia group in the left amygdala and right STS during emotion recognition and the processing of neutral facial expressions .

20045736|Unattended emotional faces elicit early lateralized amygdala-frontal and fusiform activations . .

20045736|The amygdalae are known to play a key role in emotion processing .

20045736|The present study investigated event-related neural responses during processing of facial emotions in the unattended hemifield using magnetoencephalography -LRB- MEG -RRB- and found activations of the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex to fear as early as 100 ms. The right amygdala exhibited temporally dissociated activations to input from different visual fields , suggesting early subcortical versus later cortical processing of fear .

20045475|Current related neural models concern the intended control of reactions towards external events , mediated by prefrontal cortex regions upon basal emotion processing as in the amygdala .

20045475|The conditions of self-reflection and emotion-introspection showed distinguishable activations in medial and ventrolateral prefrontal areas , in parietal regions and in the amygdala .

20045475|Notably , amygdala activity decreased during emotion-introspection and increased compared to ` neutral ' during self-reflection .

20045021|The paraventricular nucleus of the midline thalamus -LRB- PVT -RRB- innervates areas of the extended amygdala known to play a key role in the expression of emotional behaviors .

20044070|Furthermore , amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- responsiveness to emotional stimuli has been suggested as a predictor of treatment response .

20044070|This study investigated the association between genetic variants of the interleukin 1 beta -LRB- IL1B -RRB- gene and amygdala and ACC responsiveness to emotional stimuli and response to antidepressant treatment .

20044070|The imaging analyses show that the number of G-alleles in both SNPs -LRB- rs16944 and rs1143643 -RRB- was associated with reduced responsiveness of the amygdala and ACC to emotional stimulation .

20042481|The amygdala is a key area of the brain where the emotional memories are stored throughout the lifespan .

20040245|Differential patterns of initial and sustained responses in amygdala and cortical regions to emotional stimuli in schizophrenia patients and healthy participants . .

20040245|We evaluated brain activity and connectivity in the amygdala and cortical regions during the initial -LRB- first 21 seconds of each stimulation block -RRB- and sustained -LRB- last 21 seconds -RRB- stages of an emotional processing task , and we determined changes in amygdala activity across the emotional processing task .

20040245|The controls showed increasing amygdala activity across the emotional blocks , whereas activity progressively decreased in the schizophrenia group .

20036269|This study was designed to compare three models that relate abnormal social behavior with amygdala function in WS -LRB- indiscriminate sociability , emotional and empathic sociability and social fearlessness -RRB- .

20036269|These findings contribute to our understanding of social and emotional functioning in neurodevelopmental conditions and provide evidence that in WS , amygdala response to fear modulates social behavior .

20035882|Activation of the amygdala and the fusiform face area -LRB- FFA -RRB- are consistent findings in imaging studies on emotional face processing .

20035882|There is evidence that these activations occur even when emotional faces are unattended ; however , it was also shown that amygdala and FFA activation were modulated by the attentional resources allocated to these stimuli .

20035801|The central nucleus of amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , part of the limbic system , plays an important role in learning , memory , regulation of feeding , anxiety and emotional behavior .

20034306|-LSB- Somatotopy in the emotional expression by the amygdala -RSB- . .

20034306|Sensory information of various modalities is integrated in the amygdala , where the emotional information is subsequently generated .

20034306|Taking into account the above mentioned emotional system , the examination of somatotopic representation in the amygdala and related structures is very difficult .

20034306|Accordingly , the amygdala-cingulate cortex-facial nucleus system is involved in the emotional expression by the facial movement .

20034306|Furthermore , the amygdala-cingulate cortex projection develops from adolescence to adulthood and reflects the emotional maturation and the development of social adaptation .

20030625|Because the amygdala is a critical site for emotional memory formation , and many emotional and neurodevelopmental pathologies have been linked to amygdala-based abnormalities , considerable efforts have been devoted to the characterization of its circuitry .

20026086|Errors recruit both cognitive and emotional monitoring systems : simultaneous intracranial recordings in the dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus and amygdala combined with fMRI . .

20026086|More surprisingly , we found that the left amygdala also participated to error monitoring -LRB- although no emotional stimuli were used -RRB- , but with a very different neurophysiological profile as compared with the dorsal cingulate cortex .

20025856|These results suggest that the amygdala is not involved in the visual but is involved in the emotional processing of dynamic facial expressions , including specifically the elicitation of subjective emotions .

20023652|This result suggests that automatic emotional processing in the amygdala lies at the core of prosocial value orientation .

20017134|By contrast , amygdala damage did not affect explicit perception of fearful expressions nor a distinct emotional ERP effect at 150-250 ms. These results demonstrate two distinct time-points at which the amygdala influences fear processing .

20006965|There are indications that the medial amygdaloid nucleus may be a pivotal player in acute responses to emotional environmental stimuli .

20005830|Findings revealed that the breaking of the promise is associated with increased activation in the DLPFC , ACC , and amygdala , suggesting that the dishonest act involves an emotional conflict due to the suppression of the honest response .

20005239|This was confirmed by a recent PET study where these emotional modifications were correlated with changes in glucose metabolism in different brain regions , including the amygdala and the orbitofrontal regions that are well known for their involvement in emotional processing .

20004715|Together , these data suggest a complex neurobehavioral phenotype , wherein IFN-gamma deletion engenders a state of heightened basal emotionality coupled with increased monoaminergic activity in the amygdala .

20001123|Self-relevance processing in the human amygdala : gaze direction , facial expression , and emotion intensity . .

20001123|This interaction pattern was observed behaviorally for emotion intensity ratings , and neurally for functional magnetic resonance imaging activation in amygdala , as well as fusiform and medial prefrontal cortices , but only for mild - and not high-intensity expressions .

20001123|These results support an involvement of human amygdala in the appraisal of self-relevance and reveal a crucial role of expression intensity in emotion and gaze interactions .

20001112|The dopaminergic and the serotonergic neurotransmitter system have been found to modulate the amygdala-connected circuitries that are crucial in emotional modulation and response to fearful stimuli .

19997525|Factor 1 is associated with deficits in amygdala-mediated emotion , while Factor 2 is related to deficits in higher-order cognitive processes .

19995593|The amygdalar complex is a limbic structure that plays a key role in emotional processing and fear conditioning .

19969089|Individuals carrying the short allele of a common polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene -LRB- 5-HTTLPR -RRB- exhibit heightened amygdala responses to passive stimulation with aversive emotional material .

19969089|In turn , the level of amygdala activation in response to emotion can be decreased by will , for example by using cognitive emotion regulation strategies .

19969089|In the present study , 37 female subjects -LRB- s-carriers : n = 21 ; l/l-homozygotes : n = 16 -RRB- performed an emotion regulation task during functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine whether cognitive emotion regulation can modulate the genetically determined amygdala hyperreactivity in 5-HTTLPR short allele carriers .

19969089|Our results demonstrate that cognitive emotion regulation diminishes the difference in amygdala reactivity to threat-related stimuli between 5-HTTLPR genotype groups .

19962442|However , it remains unclear whether 5-HTTLPR modulates amygdala responses specifically to negative stimuli or rather to emotionally salient stimuli in general .

19962442|We observed a robust emotion by genotype group interaction in the right amygdala .

19959343|Coronary Artery Disease -LRB- CAD -RRB- and Major Depressive Disorder -LRB- MDD -RRB- commonly co-occur and may be linked by a network of brain regions involved in emotion regulation , including the orbitofrontal cortex , amygdala/parahippocamal region and insula .

19958569|The amygdala has a key role in automatic non-conscious processing of emotions .

19958569|Highly salient emotional stimuli elicit amygdala activity , and happy faces are among the most rapidly perceived facial expressions .

19957268|During cognitively decreasing emotional reactions , women recruited parts of the orbitofrontal cortex , the anterior cingulate , and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to a lesser extent than men , while there was no sex effect on amygdala activity .

19957268|In contrast , compared to women , men showed an increased recruitment of regulatory cortical areas during cognitively increasing initial emotional reactions , which was associated with an increase in amygdala activity .

19948192|Three interconnected neural regions , the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- , basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and the ventral tegmental area -LRB- VTA -RRB- have received considerable experimental attention , both in animal and clinical research models , as essential interconnected processors of emotional information .

19944302|SWS benefits the consolidation of hippocampus-dependent declarative memories , whereas REM sleep improves amygdala-dependent emotional memories and procedural skill memories involving striato-cortical circuitry .

19940182|The timing of emotional discrimination in human amygdala and ventral visual cortex . .

19940182|Models of visual emotional perception suggest a reentrant organization of the ventral visual system with the amygdala .

19940182|Using focused functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans with a sampling rate of 100 ms , here we determine the relative timing of emotional discrimination in amygdala and ventral visual cortical structures during emotional perception .

19940182|Results show that amygdala and inferotemporal visual cortex differentiate emotional from nonemotional scenes approximately 1 s before extrastriate occipital cortex , whereas primary occipital cortex shows consistent activity across all scenes .

19940182|This pattern of discrimination is consistent with a reentrant organization of emotional perception in visual processing , in which transaction between rostral ventral visual cortex and amygdala originates the identification of emotional relevance .

19940176|Dopamine D -LRB- 2 -RRB- receptor signaling is involved in modulation of emotional behavior and activity of associated brain regions such as the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex .

19940176|Functional magnetic resonance imaging in a sample of 24 individuals indicated greater amygdala activity during implicit processing and greater dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- response during explicit processing of facial emotional stimuli in GG subjects compared with GT .

19940176|Other results also demonstrate an interaction between DRD2 genotype and facial emotional expression on functional connectivity of both amygdala and dorsolateral prefrontal regions with overlapping medial prefrontal areas .

19940176|Moreover , rs1076560 genotype is associated with differential relationships between amygdala/DLPFC functional connectivity and emotion control scores .

19932757|Considerable evidence indicates that glucocorticoid hormones enhance the consolidation of memory for emotionally arousing events through interactions with the noradrenergic system of the basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

19931855|The amygdala is a key region implicated in processing emotionally salient stimuli , including emotional facial expressions .

19931855|It is unclear , however , whether abnormal amygdala activity during positive and negative emotion processing represents a persistent marker of BD regardless of illness phase or a state marker of depression common or specific to BD and MDD depression .

19931855|The BDd-relative to HC , BDr , and MDD-showed elevated left amygdala activity to mild and neutral facial expressions in the sad -LRB- p < .009 -RRB- but not other emotion experiments that was not associated with medication .

19931853|The amygdala is a key region of the limbic system and plays an important role in impulsivity , affect regulation , and emotional information processing and thus is likely related to BPD symptoms .

19931853|Decreased tNAA and tCr might indicate disturbed affect regulation and emotional information processing in the amygdala of BPD patients .

19931400|BDNF gene polymorphism -LRB- Val66Met -RRB- predicts amygdala and anterior hippocampus responses to emotional faces in anxious and depressed adolescents . .

19909691|The '' washing '' factor seems to involve particular brain structures dealing with emotional control -LRB- mainly the orbito-frontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- , anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , amygdala and insula -RRB- , but the predominant areas in the '' forbidden thoughts '' factor are cognitive control brain regions -LRB- mainly basal ganglia and ACC -RRB- , and in hoarding obsessions and compulsions they are decision-making areas -LRB- mainly ventro-medial parts of the OFC and dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- -RRB- .

19904802|The effects of DRD2/3 availability in emotion-related brain regions and nicotine dependence on amygdala response to unpleasant stimuli were examined by multiple regression analysis .

19895869|Limbic system activation that occurs when a person experiences several emotions is primarily represented by the amygdala output that influences autonomic brainstem nuclei that control autonomic nervous function , thus modulating the endocrine and immune systems .

19885620|The amygdala is known to play an important role in fear , rage and emotional memory .

19880592|Integrated cannabinoid CB1 receptor transmission within the amygdala-prefrontal cortical pathway modulates neuronal plasticity and emotional memory encoding . .

19880592|The CB1 receptor is found in high concentrations in brain structures that are critical for emotional processing , including the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- .

19876409|Synaptic plasticity in the amygdala is essential for emotional learning .

19864015|Furthermore , when listening to the mother 's voice , activation was modulated in several areas , including areas involved in emotional processing -LRB- amygdala , orbito-frontal cortex -RRB- , but also , crucially , a large extent of the left posterior temporal lobe , suggesting that the mother 's voice plays a special role in the early shaping of posterior language areas .

19854625|Additionally , NPY gene impact on amygdala activation during facial emotion processing was analyzed in a subsample of 35 depressed patients .

19847311|Less is known , however , about the role of the amygdala and the striatum in learning how to exert control over emotions and avoid negative outcomes .

19836379|This role for the ventral hippocampus in anxiety is distinct from the role of the amygdala in other aspects of emotional processing , such as fear conditioning .

19833214|Both escitalopram and citalopram attenuated BOLD-signal in the amygdala and parahippocampal cortex to emotionally significant stimuli compared to control stimuli .

19828596|Here we investigated facial emotion recognition and its interaction with gaze in patients with unilateral amygdala damage -LRB- n = 19 -RRB- , compared to healthy controls -LRB- n = 10 -RRB- , using computer-generated dynamic face stimuli expressing variable intensities of fear , anger or joy , with different gaze directions -LRB- direct versus averted -RRB- .

19828596|Our results confirm a critical role for the amygdala in self-relevance appraisal , showing an interaction between gaze and emotion in healthy controls , a trend for such interaction in left-damaged patients but not in right-damaged patients .

19826083|A genetic variation of the noradrenergic system is related to differential amygdala activation during encoding of emotional memories . .

19826083|Carriers of the ADRA2B deletion variant exhibited increased activation of the amygdala during encoding of photographs with negative emotional valence compared with noncarriers of the deletion .

19824174|These invariant representations are ideally suited to provide the inputs to brain regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala that learn the reinforcement associations of an individual 's face , for then the learning , and the appropriate social and emotional responses generalize to other views of the same face .

19824174|These neurons thus provide important additional inputs to parts of the brain such as the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala that are involved in social communication and emotional behaviour .

19818382|By contrast , increased demands in the emotion task -LRB- reappraisal -RRB- were associated with increased activity in ventromedial PFC along with decreased amygdala activity .

19795102|The following links exist between the auditory and stress systems : the limbic system , which regulates instinctive behavior and emotions , is linked to the auditory system via the medial geniculate body -LRB- amygdala -RRB- .

26952770|The ventral prefrontal cortex -LRB- VPFC -RRB- and amygdala are highly interconnected structures that jointly play a central role in emotional regulation .

26952770|Numerous research groups have reported prominent structural and functional abnormalities within the VPFC and amygdala supporting their essential role in a neural system underlying the emotional dysregulation that is a core feature of BD .

19782686|Sex hormones have actions in brain regions important for emotion , including the amygdala and prefrontal cortex .

19782686|We hypothesized that hormones would affect the amount or persistence of emotion-induced brain activity in the amygdala and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- VLPFC -RRB- .

19750552|Notably , interactions between the developing amygdala and HPA axis underlie critical periods for emotional learning , which are modulated by developmental support and maternal care .

19748540|The emotional discrimination task activated brain areas that are known to participate in processing of emotional faces -LRB- fusiform gyrus , insula and amygdala -RRB- regardless of the psychiatric condition .

19748078|Patients responded aggressively and showed heightened rGMR in emotional brain areas , including amygdala and OFC , in response to provocation but not in more dorsal brain regions associated with cognitive control of aggression .

19748075|A robust emotion by group interaction was observed in the right amygdala .

19748075|Thus , depression is characterized by mood-congruent processing of emotional stimuli in the amygdala already at an automatic level of processing .

19736355|Findings support prior hypotheses of amygdala deficits in individuals with psychopathy and indicate that amygdala abnormalities contribute to emotional and behavioral symptoms of psychopathy .

19735293|We conclude that : -LRB- i -RRB- impairment in decision-making and recognition of facial emotions occurs at the early stages of PD , -LRB- ii -RRB- these neuropsychological deficits are accompanied by degeneration of OFC and amygdala , and -LRB- iii -RRB- bilateral OFC reductions are associated with impaired recognition of emotions , and GM volume loss in left lateral OFC is related to decision-making impairment in PD .

19727065|Schizophrenia is a disorder in which disturbances in the integration of emotion with cognition plays a central role and probably involves several different regions , including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , the rostral anterior cingulate cortex , the hippocampal formation , and basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

19726029|The amygdala has long been a site of intense interest in the search for neuropathology in autism , given its role in emotional and social behavior .

19718035|The amygdala plays key roles in emotion and social cognition , but how this translates to face-to-face interactions involving real people remains unknown .

19718035|The amygdala may be required to trigger the strong emotional reactions normally following personal space violations , thus regulating interpersonal distance in humans .

19710309|Anatomically overlapping , additive effects of spatial and emotional cuing were identified in the IPS , FEFs , and FG , regions that also displayed augmented connectivity with the amygdala after cues predicting angry faces .

19709644|We explored human amygdala function during explicit behavioral decision making about discrete emotional facial expressions that can represent socially unambiguous and ambiguous cues .

19709644|Imaging data on stimuli judged to be avoided revealed a significant task by emotion interaction in the amygdala .

19706473|Substantial similarity in amygdala neuronal activity during conditioned appetitive and aversive emotional arousal . .

19706473|The amygdala is important for determining the emotional significance of environmental stimuli .

19706473|Together , our results suggest that a substantial proportion of neuronal circuits within the amygdala can contribute to both appetitive and aversive emotional arousal .

19703320|These Fronto-amygdalar Age-related Differences in Emotion -LRB- FADE -RRB- may reflect emotional regulation strategies mediated by frontal brain regions that dampen emotion-related activations in the amygdala .

19699795|On the one hand , higher memory load attenuated emotion-related amygdala activation in controls but not in the exposed adolescents ; on the other hand , prefrontal activation associated with memory load decreased in the presence of emotional distraction in the controls but increased in the exposed group .

19699473|During this period the amygdala , which regulates emotions , undergoes structural reorganization .

19699473|Auditory fear conditioning , a form of amygdala-dependent emotional learning , occurs differently in juvenile and adult rodents .

19696688|Response and habituation of the amygdala during processing of emotional prosody . .

19696688|Using event-related functional MRI -LRB- fMRI -RRB- , we showed increased amygdalar responses to various emotions -LRB- anger , fear , happiness , eroticism -RRB- expressed by prosody , a means of communication bound to language and consequently unique to humans .

19696688|The smallest signal increases were found for fearful prosody , a finding that could not be explained by rapid response habituation to stimuli of this emotional category , challenging classical theories about fear specificity of the human amygdala .

19695759|This review discusses the emotional and incentive-driven behavioral changes in adolescents and their associated neural mechanisms , focusing on the dynamic interactions between the amygdala , ventral striatum , and prefrontal cortex .

19693001|These early studies identified the amygdala , hippocampus , and other parts of what was termed the ` limbic ' system as central parts of the emotional brain .

19683585|Neuroticism modulates amygdala-prefrontal connectivity in response to negative emotional facial expressions . .

19683585|Activity and functional amygdala connectivity -LRB- psycho-physiological interaction -LSB- PPI -RSB- -RRB- related to faces of negative emotional valence -LRB- angry , fearful and sad -RRB- was compared to neutral facial expressions , while neuroticism scores were entered as a regressor .

19679112|Research regarding the lateralization of processing emotional visual stimuli suggests various roles for affective information-processing by the amygdalae .

19673803|Changes in dissonance induced event-related potentials -LRB- ERPs -RRB- in the auditory areas from 200 ms onward , in the orbito-frontal cortex -LRB- 500-1000 ms -RRB- , and later in the amygdala and anterior cingulate gyrus -LRB- 1200-1400 ms -RRB- , suggesting the sequential involvement of these brain structures in implicit emotional judgment of musical dissonance .

19673745|However , whereas control participants showed stronger activation in the amygdala and hippocampus when viewing faces with emotional -LRB- relative to neutral -RRB- expressions , the alcoholics responded in an undifferentiated manner to all facial expressions .

19673745|Prefrontal modulation of emotional function as a compensation for the blunted amygdala activity during a socially relevant face appraisal task is in agreement with a distributed network engagement during emotional face processing .

19673745|Deficient activation of amygdala and hippocampus may underlie impaired processing of emotional faces associated with long-term alcoholism and may be a part of the wide array of behavioral problems including disinhibition , concurring with previously documented interpersonal difficulties in this population .

19665877|The results showed that children with autism exhibited intact emotion matching , while showing diminished activation of the fusiform gyrus -LRB- FG -RRB- and the amygdala .

19665877|In summary , the data are consistent with abnormalities in circuits involved in emotion and face processing reported in studies of older subjects with autism showing reductions in amygdala activation related to emotion processing and reduced fusiform activation involved in face processing .

19664757|We propose a deleterious role of intraneuronal Abeta on amygdala-dependent emotional responses by affecting the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase -LRB- ERK/MAPK -RRB- signaling pathway .

19663654|The hippocampus and amygdala form part of the limbic system , which plays a central role in controlling such expressions of emotional reactivity .

19660562|Is the contribution of the amygdala to the sex - and enhancement-related effects of emotional memory time-dependent ? .

19660562|Whether the sex-related lateralization of amygdala function -LRB- i.e. , the female-left/male-right effect -RRB- in the emotional enhancement of memory -LRB- EEM -RRB- is time-dependent remains unclear .

19660562|The present and previous studies indicate that sex-related lateralization of amygdala function occurs in the 2 - to 3-week EEM , but it does not occur in the 1-week , 24-h , or less than 30-min EEM , suggesting that this effect on emotional memory may also be time-dependent .

19659454|Only colostrum induced the activation of the cortical amygdala and insular cortex , two structures involved in learning , associative processes , reward and emotion .

19658066|mr and gr are located primarily in the hippocampus , amygdala and prefrontal cortex which regulate emotion and cognition .

19653893|General and specific responsiveness of the amygdala during explicit emotion recognition in females and males . .

19653893|The ability to recognize emotions in facial expressions relies on an extensive neural network with the amygdala as the key node as has typically been demonstrated for the processing of fearful stimuli .

19653893|This high-resolution fMRI study addresses some of the relevant parameters , such as emotional valence , gender and poser ethnicity on amygdala activation during facial emotion recognition in 50 Caucasian subjects .

19653893|Bilateral amygdala activation was obtained to all emotional expressions -LRB- anger , disgust , fear , happy , and sad -RRB- and neutral faces across all subjects .

19653893|No significant influence of poser ethnicity on amygdala activation occurred , but analysis of recognition accuracy revealed a significant impact of poser ethnicity that was emotion-dependent .

19653893|Applying high-resolution fMRI while subjects were performing an explicit emotion recognition task revealed bilateral amygdala activation to all emotions presented and neutral expressions .

19646532|We localised emotion networks individually in thirteen participants using fMRI and trained them to upregulate target areas , including the insula and amygdala .

19643146|The amygdala has been shown to be functionally asymmetrical in both rats and humans and its involvement in stress and emotion processing is well documented .

22640382|In contrast , we hypothesized that bipolar subjects would show altered brain activation in regions responsible for emotionally homeostasis , including the striatum and amygdala .

19641623|Chemosensory cues to conspecific emotional stress activate amygdala in humans . .

19641623|In an fMRI experiment and its replication , we showed that scanned participants showed amygdala activation in response to samples obtained from donors undergoing an emotional , but not physical , stressor .

19639751|The amygdala has well-established roles in stress and emotion ; the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CNA -RRB- projects to REM regulatory regions in the brainstem and has been found to play a key role in the regulation of REM .

19632787|The neuropeptide oxytocin -LRB- OXT -RRB- has previously been found to reduce amygdala reactivity to social and emotional stimuli in healthy men .

19627640|We suggest that this increase may reflect a compensatory cortical control mechanism with the effect of limiting emotional dysregulation in limbic regions such as the amygdala .

19607886|The central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- is an important neuroanatomical substrate of emotional processes that are critically involved in addictive behaviors .

19607886|Thus , postsynaptic co-modulation of central amygdala neurons may be a key cellular substrate mediating glutamate and opioid interaction on neural signaling and plasticity associated with normal and pathological emotional processes associated with addictive behaviors .

19605649|They mirror deficits observed in patients with amygdala lesions and open a window for future studies on patients with autism spectrum disorder , in which deficits in emotion recognition , probably related to atypical gaze patterns and abnormal amygdala activation , have been observed .

19603072|Eyes wide shut : amygdala mediates eyes-closed effect on emotional experience with music . .

19603072|More specifically , we focused on the amygdala as a central node of the limbic system and on its co-activation with the Locus Ceruleus -LRB- LC -RRB- and Ventral Prefrontal Cortex -LRB- VPFC -RRB- ; regions involved in processing of , respectively , ` low ' , visceral - , and ` high ' , cognitive-related , values of emotional stimuli .

19603072|In correspondence , fMRI results showed greater activation in the amygdala when subjects listened to the emotional music with eyes closed relative to eyes open .

19603072|This finding supports a system-based model of perceived emotionality in which the amygdala has a central role in mediating the effect of context-based processing style by recruiting neural operations involved in both visceral -LRB- i.e. ` low ' -RRB- and cognitive -LRB- i.e. ` high ' -RRB- related processes of emotions .

19595679|Furthermore , after localizing an emotion task-induced activation in the anterior cingulate cortex , inferior frontal sulcus and amygdala , the directional influences among these brain regions were resolved using our new approach .

19594507|Bipolar and healthy individuals did not differ in amygdala activity in response to either emotion .

19589603|The relationships between the MPFC , the rostral ACC , and the amygdala appear to reflect an interaction between the self-referential processing and the negative emotional information processing , and we propose that the strong connection between the MPFC and the rostral ACC is associated with depressive symptoms .

19573050|The amygdala plays a major role in processing emotional stimuli .

19568481|The amygdala and insula are known to serve broad functions in emotional processing , including integration of affective information .

19568481|In addition to prior findings of probes of social information processing , our findings suggest that the amygdala and insula responses are hyper-reactive to general emotional images with negative emotional content and that these brain regions may play divergent roles in their representation of different phenotypes .

19565652|Emotional and anxiety-related behaviors were also improved by enriched stimuli , but the effect of enriched environments on the amygdala , one of the major emotion-related structures in the central nervous system , remains largely unknown .

19560270|Sex differences were apparent in the homeostatic afferent network -LRB- parabrachial nucleus , thalamus , insular and dorsal anterior cingulate cortices -RRB- , in an emotional-arousal network -LRB- amygdala , locus coeruleus complex -RRB- , and in cortical areas modulating these networks -LRB- prefrontal cortex -RRB- .

19559575|The mOFC is involved in emotional decision-making under uncertain conditions and has the ability to suppress the amygdala , both of which are hypothesized functions of worry .

19553918|These alterations are proposed to be due in part to adaptations in the brain regions that regulate emotional behavior , including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- , a principal output nucleus of the amygdala .

19543398|This finding is discussed in relation to previous behavioral research relating personality to selective attention for trait-congruent emotional information , neuroimaging studies relating differences in personality to amygdala reactivity to socially relevant stimuli , and genetic studies suggesting linkages between the serotonin transporter gene and neuroticism .

19540895|Relative to animals showing no significant levels of defensive burying activity , rats showing sustained elevations in defensive burying displayed higher levels of arginine vasopressin -LRB- AVP -RRB- mRNA and increased numbers of androgen receptor positive cells in the medial amygdala and posterior bed nuclei of the stria terminalis , brain regions that integrate emotional appraisal and sensory information .

19539268|Following ATD , habenula blood flow increased significantly in the rMDD subjects relative to the control subjects , and increasing amygdala blood flow was associated with more negative emotional bias score across both groups .

19530218|Activity in limbic regions , including the amygdala and ventral striatum , has previously been shown to correlate with identification of emotional content in faces ; however , little work has been done describing how these signals may influence emotional face memory .

19530218|These effects of prior emotion were independent of task performance , with differences being seen in the amygdala and ventral striatum even if only incorrect trials were considered .

19526456|Besides genes modulating neural transmission and influencing amygdala reactivity and anxiety-related temperamental traits a different plasticity regulating genes affect interindividual differences in emotional regulation .

19524887|A reduced automatic reactivity of the amygdala and visual occipito-temporal areas could implicate less automated engagement in the encoding of emotional stimuli in high alexithymia .

19524887|In addition , a low spontaneous insular and amygdalar responsivity in high alexithymia individuals could be related to an attenuation of basic emotional experiences which may contribute to problems in identifying and differentiating one 's feelings .

19505685|These findings are consistent with data from previous studies demonstrating critical roles for certain brain regions - particularly the amygdala and insular cortex - in processing facially and vocally displayed basic emotions , and furthermore , suggest that recognition of bodily expressed emotions may not depend on neural structures involved in facial and vocal emotion recognition .

19501062|Comparing dynamic stimuli to static faces indicated enhanced emotion-specific brain activation patterns in the parahippocampal gyrus -LRB- PHG -RRB- including the amygdala -LRB- AMG -RRB- , fusiform gyrus -LRB- FG -RRB- , superior temporal gyrus -LRB- STG -RRB- , inferior frontal gyrus -LRB- IFG -RRB- , and occipital and orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- .

19494159|The central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- has been traditionally viewed in fear conditioning to serve as an output neural center that transfers conditioned information formed in the basolateral amygdala to brain structures that generate emotional responses .

19493626|In studies employing functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- , reactivity of the amygdala to threat-related sensory cues -LRB- viz. , facial displays of negative emotion -RRB- has been found to correlate positively with interindividual variability in testosterone levels of women and young men and to increase on acute administration of exogenous testosterone .

19492692|These changes involve a shift in control over behavior away from regions geared toward emotional processing , such as the amygdala and reward system , toward the frontal lobes , which are involved in making plans for the future , suppressing impulses , weighing options , and other critical cognitive skills needed to function in the adult world .

19486944|The emotional arousal effects were mediated by the right amygdala .

19482265|The results point to a role of amygdalar NPY in negative emotion and might reflect state processes at least in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy .

19481570|In line with their localization in the hippocampus , amygdala , hypothalamus , striatum and spinal cord , their functions are related to learning and memory , emotional control , stress response and pain .

19480985|Research data suggest that the amygdala and some related brain structures modulate the processing of emotional visual stimuli even when they are not consciously perceived .

19480985|In this study , we examined neural responses to investigate whether and how other brain areas anatomically connected to the amygdala might become activated during both overt and covert presentation of conditioned emotional visual stimuli .

19480985|In the overt condition , an angry face associated with a painful stimulus -LRB- CS + -RRB- , a happy -LRB- H -RRB- and a neutral face -LRB- N -RRB- were presented for 75 ms. Based on results of functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- in 10 healthy volunteers , we show evidence that a network of brain structures anatomically connected to the amygdala -LRB- including the anterior insula , the fusiform gyrus and the superior temporal sulcus -RRB- are involved in the subliminal processing of visual emotional stimuli .

19480227|We aimed to test for metabolic changes in specific brain areas , '' regions of interest , '' thought to be involved in emotional processing , sleep regulation and pathophysiology of narcolepsy : hypothalamus , pontomesencephalic junction and both amygdalae .

19479638|Furthermore , cultural aspects influence the neural correlates of face and emotion processing thereby also affecting the response of the amygdala .

19478294|Effect of a single dose of citalopram on amygdala response to emotional faces . .

19478294|To investigate the effect of a single dose of an SSRI on the amygdala response to emotional faces .

19475335|Dopamine and acetylcholine neurons in the brainstem and basal forebrain/septal areas , which send outputs to NAc , hippocampus and amygdala , are also regulated by PFC glutamatergic projections , and seem to be of special relevance in modulating motor , emotional and mnemonic functions .

19474217|The lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is implicated in emotional and social behaviors .

19466680|In conjunction with earlier findings , these results suggest that risky decision-making is dependent on the integrity of a neural circuitry that includes several brain regions known to be critical for the experience and expression of emotions , namely the insula , amygdala , and ventromedial prefrontal cortex .

19462002|This study provides evidence that stimulus order in the presentation of emotional stimuli has a markedly larger influence on the brain 's response in remitted PD than in controls , leading to abnormal responses of the dACC/dmPFC and lower limbic structures -LRB- including the amygdala -RRB- and brainstem .

19454919|Previous study supports the presence of reduced volume and elevated response to emotional stimuli in amygdala in adolescents with bipolar disorder -LRB- BD -RRB- .

19454919|We hypothesized that amygdala volume would be inversely associated with amygdala response to emotional stimuli , such that BD participants with the smallest amygdala volumes would exhibit the highest amygdala response .

19454919|Adolescents with BD showed decreased amygdala volume -LRB- p = .009 -RRB- and increased amygdala response to emotional faces -LRB- p = .043 -RRB- .

19454919|A significant inverse association between amygdala volume and activation during emotional face processing was observed -LRB- r = -0.54 , p = .029 -RRB- .

19454919|Decreased volume and increased response to emotional stimuli in the amygdala in adolescents with BD are consistent with previous reports .

19454919|This study represents the first report , to our knowledge , of the two findings in the same adolescent BD sample and supports an amygdala structure-function relation characterized by an inverse association between volume and response to emotional stimuli .

19454919|This preliminary finding requires replication and suggests a possible pathophysiological link between abnormalities in amygdala structure and response to emotional stimuli in BD .

19452191|18FDG PET study of amygdalar activity during facial emotion recognition in schizophrenia . .

19452191|The role of the amygdala during facial emotion recognition -LRB- FER -RRB- tasks as well as its clinical implications in schizophrenia patients remains unclear .

19452191|Left amygdalar hyperactivation among the schizophrenia group was shown in both emotional and control tasks when compared to healthy subjects .

19452191|Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia exhibit a non-task specific amygdalar hyperactivation during a continuous emotional and non-emotional task when compared to matched healthy controls .

19450794|We employed dynamic causal modeling to examine significant among-group alterations in effective connectivity -LRB- EC -RRB- between right - and left-sided neural regions supporting emotion regulation : amygdala and orbitomedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- OMPFC -RRB- .

19447194|Both effects , enhanced memory for emotional words and retrograde amnesia for preceding words , are dependent on intactness of the amygdala .

19447194|In this study we asked whether patients with temporal lobe epilepsy -LRB- TLE -RRB- , a disease that often involves the amygdala as well , show altered memory for emotional words and the words presented in close temporal proximity .

19447194|Hence , we conclude that patients with TLE have a specific deficit in the emotion-driven encoding enhancement mediated by the amygdala-hippocampus loop .

19446795|We tested the hypothesis that violent patients with schizophrenia who had high psychopathy scores would show attenuated amygdala responses to emotional -LRB- particularly fearful -RRB- faces compared with those with low psychopathy scores .

19446638|In contrast , within the amygdala , activity associated with identifying positive target expressions declined with the introduction of neutral and incongruent expressions ; however , activity associated with fearful target expressions was less susceptible to the influence of emotional context .

19446538|In mammals the amygdala , a limbic structure involved in the control of emotion and mood , receives 5-HT-containing projections originating in the RDN .

19434554|The basolateral amygdala has a key role in mediating emotional memories in general .

19430471|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- mediates the facilitating effects of emotions on memory .

19429164|The dorsal region of the AIC may be involved in auditory-motor integration , while the ventral part of the AIC may interface the amygdala with insular regions involved in the regulation of physiological changes related to emotional states .

19428222|Earlier imaging studies in schizophrenia have reported abnormal amygdala and prefrontal cortex activity during emotion processing .

19428222|We investigated with functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- during emotion processing changes in activity of the amygdala and of prefrontal cortex in patients with schizophrenia during 8 weeks of olanzapine treatment .

19428222|These results suggest that longitudinal treatment with olanzapine may be associated with specific changes in activity of the amygdala and prefrontal cortex during emotional processing in schizophrenia .

19427632|Abnormalities in the morphology and function of two gray matter structures central to emotional processing , the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- pACC -RRB- and amygdala , have consistently been reported in bipolar disorder -LRB- BD -RRB- .

19427632|The significant association between pACC-amygdala functional connectivity and the structural integrity of white matter that contains pACC-amygdala connections suggest that disruptions in white matter connectivity may contribute to disturbances in the coordinated responses of the pACC and amygdala during emotional processing in BD .

19427530|Anatomical specificity of functional amygdala imaging of responses to stimuli with positive and negative emotional valence . .

19427530|Moreover , these results show that a core region of the amygdala is responsive to stimuli both of positive and negative emotional valence .

19420090|Functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- appears , therefore , to be a sensible tool to explore neurobiological mechanisms of emotions in multiple sclerosis since it also allows investigation of the functional connectivity or ` communication ' between critical regions in affective behaviour -LSB- e.g. the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- and amygdala -RSB- .

19409390|In Experiment 2 , we found that increases in locomotor activity following co-administration of CRF -LRB- 25 ng -RRB- and fluoxetine -LRB- 100 ng -RRB- were associated with decreased 5-HT concentrations in a number of forebrain structures involved in regulation of emotional behavior and emotional states , including the ventral striatum , amygdala pars lateralis , and dorsal hypothalamus , measured 37 min after treatment .

19403890|Our results support the view that the amygdala is involved in the early processing of coarse threat related information and that theta is important in integrating activity within emotion-processing networks .

19394205|These findings suggest that BPD patients show greater amygdala activity and heightened activity of visual processing regions relative to findings for HC subjects in the processing of negative social emotional pictures compared with rest .

19386910|At 6 month retest , recollection was associated with significantly larger responses in subjects allowed to sleep than in sleep-deprived subjects , in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vMPFC -RRB- and the precuneus , two areas involved in memory retrieval , as well as in the extended amygdala and the occipital cortex , two regions the response of which was modulated by emotion at encoding .

19386755|The amygdala formation is implicated in generation of emotional states such as anxiety and fear .

19383529|Overall , these findings suggest that GIT1 is involved in the regulation of amygdala-mediated experience-based emotional behaviors .

19376098|A fMRI study revealed that higher cortisol levels were associated with a stronger amygdala response to emotional stimuli .

19360655|Findings of this study thus point to reduced influence of emotion on memory processes in ASD than in typically developing individuals , possibly owing to amygdala dysfunctions .

19359671|In this review , the authors present neuroscientific data highlighting the function of two brain areas -- the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- -- in PTSD and related emotional processes .

19359671|A convergent body of human and nonhuman studies suggests that the amygdala mediates the acquisition and expression of conditioned fear and the enhancement of emotional memory , whereas the vmPFC mediates the extinction of conditioned fear and the volitional regulation of negative emotion .

19348735|Conversely , across all emotional conditions the parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala , fusiform gyrus , lingual gyrus , precuneus , inferior and middle occipital gyrus , posterior cingulated , middle temporal gyrus , inferior frontal and superior frontal gyri were activated bilaterally -LRB- p = 0.001 -RRB- .

19348735|There was a valence-specific lateralization of brain response during negative emotions processing in the left amygdala -LRB- p = 0.001 -RRB- .

19348528|Impact of amygdala , orbital frontal , or hippocampal lesions on threat avoidance and emotional reactivity in nonhuman primates . .

19348528|The authors measured the effects of bilateral amygdaloid , orbital frontal , or hippocampal lesions on emotional reactivity and passive avoidance in rhesus monkeys -LRB- Macaca mulatta -RRB- .

19348528|These results expand our understanding of how the primate brain evaluates reward and threat , and indicate a highly specialized role for the amygdala in mediating passive avoidance and emotional reactivity to potentially life-threatening stimuli .

19341764|Furthermore , growing evidence indicates that these different glucocorticoid effects all depend on emotional arousal-induced activation of noradrenergic transmission within the basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and on interactions of the BLA with other brain regions , such as the hippocampus and neocortical regions .

19336391|When processing facial expressions of emotions , both patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls activated the bilateral amygdala and right fusiform gyri .

19336391|A marked underrecruitment of the amygdala , accompanied by a substantial limitation in activation throughout a ventral temporal-basal ganglia-prefrontal cortex '' social brain '' system may be central to the difficulties patients experience when processing facial emotion .

19328775|Additional research indicates that activation of efferent projections of the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , a brain region implicated in mammalian emotion , modulates memory processes occurring in other brain structures .

19327970|Neuro-cognitive models of human anxiety and findings from fMRI suggest dysfunction in amygdala-prefrontal circuitry underlies biases in emotion activation and regulation .

19325644|Influence of emotional arousal on the N150 of the Auditory Evoked Potential from the rat amygdala . .

19325644|This study tested whether a general increase in emotional arousal is a sufficient determinant for the evocation of the N150 , a negative wave in amygdalar Auditory Evoked Potentials -LRB- AEPs -RRB- .

19321655|Feedback inhibition of the amygdala via medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- is an important component in the regulation of complex emotional behaviors .

19321655|Furthermore , functional coupling between the amygdala and mPFC was positively correlated with 5-HT -LRB- 2A -RRB- density suggesting that effective integration of emotionally salient information within this corticolimbic circuitry may be modulated , at least in part , by mPFC 5-HT -LRB- 2A -RRB- .

19321315|These results suggest that visually elicited phobic reactions activate object recognition areas and deactivate prefrontal areas involved in cognitive control over emotion-triggering areas like the amygdala , resulting in motor readiness to support fight or flight .

19318989|Youths with callous-unemotional traits experience emotional processing deficits seemingly on par with deficits showed by patients with amygdala damage .

19308794|The amygdala is another structure that has been widely implicated in emotion processing and social decision-making , and the question arises as to whether the amygdala , in a manner akin to what has been observed for the prefrontal cortex , might have sex-related functional asymmetry in regard to social and emotional functions .

19308794|These data provide preliminary support for the notion that sex-related functional asymmetry of the amygdala may entail functions such as social conduct , emotional processing , and decision-making , a finding that in turn could reflect -LRB- as either a cause or effect -RRB- differences in the manner in which men and women apprehend , process , and execute emotion-related information .

19292997|VBM results indicated that the true recognition correlated positively with grey-matter -LRB- GM -RRB- density in bilateral amygdala , anterior cingulate and middle temporal gyrus , i.e. , brain regions , involved in the memory of emotional material , as revealed by fMRI results .

19284600|Next , structural encoding of facial features -LRB- N170 -RRB- occurred between 160-200 ms in the inferior temporal/fusiform region , and perhaps early emotion processing -LRB- Vertex Positive Potential or VPP -RRB- in the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex .

19273493|Given that randomized controlled trials are now investigating a few doses of + / -3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine -LRB- MDMA , ` ecstasy ' -RRB- in combination with psychotherapy for treatment-resistant anxiety disorders , we would like to suggest the following three mechanisms for this potentially important new approach : 1 -RRB- MDMA increases oxytocin levels , which may strengthen the therapeutic alliance ; 2 -RRB- MDMA increases ventromedial prefrontal activity and decreases amygdala activity , which may improve emotional regulation and decrease avoidance and 3 -RRB- MDMA increases norepinephrine release and circulating cortisol levels , which may facilitate emotional engagement and enhance extinction of learned fear associations .

19270039|This study revealed regions common to all three tasks : The amygdala and LPFC as common regions may be involved in emotion-cognition interactions , and the DMPFC may possibly play integrative roles in explicit emotional evaluation .

19268657|Present results also suggest that the release of an endogenous BDZ receptor inverse agonist within the amygdala seems to be an important correlate of the emotional state induced by the plus-maze test .

19255436|Extensive evidence indicates that the basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- modulates the consolidation of memories for emotionally arousing experiences , an effect that involves the activation of the glucocorticoid system .

19255377|To compare amygdala response to varying attention and emotion conditions among adolescents with major depressive disorder -LRB- MDD -RRB- or anxiety disorders , relative to adolescents with no psychopathology .

19255377|Left and right amygdala activation differed as a function of diagnosis , facial expression , and attention condition both when patients with comorbid MDD and anxiety were included and when they were excluded -LRB- group x emotion x attention interactions , P < or = .03 -RRB- .

19246323|Functional neuroimaging has identified brain regions associated with voluntary regulation of emotion , including the prefrontal cortex and amygdala .

19246323|Results showed that amygdala activity elicited by unpleasant pictures was positively correlated with neuroticism and negatively correlated with a specific psychopathic trait related to emotional underreactivity .

19242292|Increased amygdala activation observed in patients with PBD elicited by incidental emotional processing relative to directed emotional processing may indicate more intense automatic emotional reactivity .

19232481|A continuous emotional task activates the left amygdala in healthy volunteers : -LRB- 18 -RRB- FDG PET study . .

19232481|Human amygdalar activation has been reported during facial emotion recognition -LRB- FER -RRB- studies , mostly using fast temporal resolution techniques -LRB- fMRI , H -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- 15 -RRB- O PET or MEG -RRB- .

19232481|In conclusion , our study reveals left amygdalar activation assessed with FDG PET , as well as other major emotion recognition-related brain areas during FER tasks .

19225430|Cortisol reactivity to the paradigm was positively associated with amygdalar and hippocampal activity and negatively associated with ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity in conditions involving emotional imagery .

19224582|Also , our findings support the view that an emotionally charged reminder cue activates the amygdala but that , as a previously fear-evoking memory cue becomes instructive , the involvement of the amygdale lessens .

19224113|Social cognitive abilities , focusing on affective aspects , were examined by an emotion intensity recognition task , which is sensitive to the amygdala function , and the emotion attribution tasks , which rely mainly on the frontal lobe function .

19202900|Accessory regulation occurs in response to environmental conditions and stimuli such as memory , stress , emotion , reward and hedonic feeling , which are operated by the limbic system , particularly the hippocampus and amygdala .

19196909|The rat basolateral amygdala is important for emotional learning ; this is modulated by noradrenaline and corticosterone .

19185207|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is a major emotional center in the brain and regulates the expression of anxiety .

19175976|High stress levels during encoding and consolidation of emotional material involve increased amygdala and hippocampus activation .

19172653|Possibly , this deficiency is related to disturbed modulations of emotion-related face processing in the FG by the amygdala and prefrontal cortex .

19166914|Epileptogenesis alters gene expression pattern in rats subjected to amygdala-dependent emotional learning . .

19164587|In men , but not in women , food stimulation with inhibition significantly decreased activation in amygdala , hippocampus , insula , orbitofrontal cortex , and striatum , which are regions involved in emotional regulation , conditioning , and motivation .

19164102|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is critical for the formation of emotional memories .

19154647|Influence of the fusiform gyrus on amygdala response to emotional faces in the non-clinical range of social anxiety . .

19154647|Functional imaging has demonstrated an increase in amygdala response to emotional faces in subjects with social anxiety .

19154647|We assessed the influence of the fusiform gyrus activation on amygdala response to emotional faces in the non-clinical range of social anxiety .

19154647|Relevant interactions among the emotional face-processing stages exist in the non-clinical range of social anxiety that may ultimately attenuate amygdala responses .

19154540|Memory with emotional content , brain amygdala and Alzheimer 's disease . .

19154540|We studied the performance of Alzheimer 's disease -LRB- AD -RRB- patients and elderly controls using a memory battery with emotional content , and we correlated these results with the amygdala and hippocampus volume .

19152542|Activity in the amygdala predicted enhanced emotional memory , with subsequent-memory activity greater for negative stimuli than for neutral stimuli , across age groups , a finding consistent with an overall enhancement of emotional memory .

19152542|These findings suggest that age-related differences in the enhancement of emotional memory might reflect decreased connectivity between the amygdala and typical subsequent-memory regions , as well as the engagement of regulatory processes that inhibit emotional responses .

19151376|Within cognitive neuroscience memorable emotional images evoke a greater amygdala response .

19151376|We explored how differences in ratings of impact influenced amygdala activity to negative emotional images matched for valence , arousal and other factors .

19151376|Our findings demonstrate that the amygdala response to emotional stimuli is not a function of arousal -LRB- or valence -RRB- alone and accord more with the proposal that the amygdala responds to the significance or relevance of an event .

19145562|The anxiogenic-like behavioral phenotype observed following both pharmacological and genetic blockade of cannabinoid CB1 receptors , together with the abundant expression of cannabinoid receptors within brain areas particularly involved in emotional control , such as amygdala , hippocampus and cortex , are among the numerous evidences that account for the participation of the endocannabinoid system in the regulation of anxiety states .

19144740|The amygdala plays a crucial role in evaluating the emotional significance of stimuli and in transforming the results of this evaluation into appropriate autonomic responses .

19144740|Lesion and stimulation studies suggest involvement of the amygdala in the generation of the skin conductance response -LRB- SCR -RRB- , which is an indirect measure of autonomic activity that has been associated with both emotion and attention .

19139843|In contrast , responses within subcortical structures -LRB- amygdala and basal ganglia -RRB- were positively correlated with emotional eating and rated appetite for the food stimuli and negatively correlated with dietary self-care .

19136216|Neuroimaging studies have documented modulation of the activity of the amygdala - a key node in the neural network underlying emotion perception and processing , and one that has also been associated with regulating aggression - by exogenous testosterone .

19136216|However , results on the impact of normal range testosterone levels on explicit emotion recognition as a prerequisite for social interaction and amygdala activation in healthy young males are missing .

19136216|Hence , we performed functional MRI at 3T in a group of 21 healthy males during explicit emotion recognition with a protocol specifically optimized to reliably detect amygdala activation .

19136216|We observed similar amygdala activation to all emotions presented without any effect of gender of poser or laterality .

19136216|Hence , our results demonstrate that testosterone levels affect amygdala activation and also behavioral responses particularly to threat-related emotions in healthy young males .

19126572|In a multivariate imaging analysis it was shown that the sarcasm -LRB- and emotion recognition -RRB- deficit was dependent on a circuit involving the lateral orbitofrontal cortex , insula , amygdala and temporal pole , particularly on the right .

21949675|Neuroimaging has demonstrated that voluntary emotion regulation is effective in reducing amygdala activation to aversive stimuli during regulation .

21949675|This effect was related to an immediate increase of amygdala signal in task 1 once active emotion regulation has been terminated : The larger this peak postregulation signal in the amygdala in task 1 , the smaller the sustained regulation effect in task 2 .

20582274|This review outlines the latest findings obtained from human studies and animal models related to the role of the emotional brain in the regulation of enteric function , specifically how increasing the gain of the amygdala to induce anxiety-like behavior using corticosterone or chronic stress increases responsiveness to both visceral and somatic stimuli in rodents .

20374149|In response to emotional stimuli bipolar patients show a dysfunction in a ventral-limbic brain network including the amygdala , insula , striatum , subgenual cingulate cortex , ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex .

20374146|The findings from these studies identify altered brain activation in five regions in cortico-limbic pathways responsible for emotional regulation : portions of the prefrontal cortex ; anterior cingulate cortex ; amygdala ; thalamus ; and striatum .

19110061|The amygdala is composed of structurally and functionally distinct nuclei that contribute to the processing of emotion through interactions with other subcortical and cortical structures .

19109443|Early childhood maltreatment -LRB- i.e. , physical , sexual , emotional abuse -RRB- and caregiver disruptions are hypothesized to be instrumental in altering the neurobiology of the brain , particularly the amygdala , and contributing to the development of the affective deficits examined in individuals with psychopathy .

19108504|-LSB- Relationship between the amygdala activity and emotion/stress responses as revealed by fMRI and genetic analysis -RSB- . .

19108504|Animal experiments have shown that neural interaction between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex is involved in emotion and aversive conditioning .

19108504|The relationship between the amygdala activity and emotion/stress responses is investigated by means of neuroimaging and genetic analysis of neurotransmitters .

19107806|It is important to know the mechanisms of amygdalar development in order to analyze the pathogenesis of emotional disorders , but they are still not adequately understood .

19094988|Peripheral neuropathy has been associated with structural and functional changes of the amygdala , a key player in emotions .

19094988|The results suggest that following nerve injury , the amygdaloid group I mGluR , particularly subtype mGluR -LRB- 1 -RRB- , has an enhanced pronociceptive effect providing a potential mechanism for emotional enhancement of pain in peripheral neuropathy .

19091328|The goal was to examine differences in functional networks associated with working memory -LRB- dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and lateral parietal cortex -RRB- and emotion processing -LRB- amygdala , ventrolateral prefrontal cortex , and fusiform gyrus -RRB- .

19085964|The amygdalae have been a focus of mood disorder research due to their key role in processing emotional information .

19084048|A novel aspect of narcoleptic patients ' behaviours now appears depending on the emotional valence of the context : how can we explain the fact that narcoleptic patients may experience pleasant-triggered -LRB- e.g. laughing -RRB- cataplexy as well as unpleasant-related drawback performance -LRB- Tucci , V. , Stegagno , L. , Vandi , S. , Ferrillo , F. , Palomba , D. , Vignatelli , L. , Ferini-Strambi , L. , Montagna , P. , Plazzi , G. , Emotional information processing in patients with narcolepsy : a psychophysiologic investigation , Sleep 26 -LRB- 2003 -RRB- 558-564 ; Khatami , R. , Birkmann , S. , Bassetti , C.L. , Amygdala dysfunction in narcolepsycataplexy , J. Sleep Res .

19076365|In a previous work it was demonstrated that emotional stressors trigger the in vivo release of the neuropeptide substance P -LRB- SP -RRB- in brain areas known to be implicated in stress and anxiety mechanisms , such as the amygdala , lateral septum , nucleus accumbens , and locus coeruleus .

19058793|On the basis of these preliminary findings it might be speculated that reduced pain sensitivity or at least the emotional component of it is associated with amygdala deactivation in patients with both disorders , whereas BPD patients without PTSD use different yet unknown antinociceptive mechanisms .

19056437|In particular , AChE activity was upregulated in major cholinergic cell nuclei -LRB- medial septum , vertical diagonal band , substantia inominata -RRB- and in cortical and thalamic regions -LRB- eye field , posterior parietal and visual cortices , posterior thalamic and lateral geniculate nuclei -RRB- responsible for selective attention and visuomotor coordination , as well as limbic structures -LRB- hippocampal formation and amygdala -RRB- with related regions -LRB- midline , periventricular , reticular thalamic nuclei , and lateral prefrontal , agranular insular cortices -RRB- involved in cognition , arousal , emotion , and plasticity .

19052197|Results showed that placebo response was accompanied by reduced stress-related activity in the amygdala , a brain region crucial for emotional processing .

18985304|On the brain level , EAM is based on the synchronous activation of cognitive fact-processing and emotional , evaluating structures -LRB- e.g. , hippocampal formation , amygdaloid body -RRB- .

19050462|The combined data indicate that music-syntactically irregular events elicit brain activity related to emotional processes , and that , in addition to intensely pleasurable music or highly unpleasant music , single chord functions can also modulate amygdala activity .

19048542|Furthermore , the prefrontal cortex , along with the amygdala and the hippocampus forms the limbic system , which is an important neural substrate of emotion processing ; therefore the psychopath 's capacity of affective processing could also be impaired .

19047574|However , we also observed increases in gamma band ERS within the amygdala , visual , prefrontal , parietal , and posterior cingulate cortices to emotional relative to neutral stimuli , irrespective of their availability to conscious access .

19042093|The regulation of emotions is ensured via inhibitory control over the amygdala .

19037205|Bipolar disorder -LRB- BD -RRB- is associated with abnormalities of the ventral anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- vACC -RRB- and its connection sites , including the amygdala , which are key components of a corticolimbic neural system that subserves emotional regulation .

19036981|We therefore hypothesized that amygdala responses to emotional facial expressions would be susceptible to pharmacologically induced increases in central NE and CORT levels .

19036981|To specifically test this hypothesis , we measured amygdala activation to emotional faces using functional magnetic resonance imaging in 62 healthy subjects under four pharmacological conditions : -LRB- 1 -RRB- single oral dose of placebo , -LRB- 2 -RRB- 4 mg of the selective NE-reuptake inhibitor reboxetine -LRB- RBX -RRB- , -LRB- 3 -RRB- 30 mg of hydrocortisone , or -LRB- 4 -RRB- both drugs in combination .

19036981|We found that a decrease in amygdala activation to positive facial emotion was coupled with an increase in amygdala activation to negative facial emotion in the RBX-CORT combined challenge condition .

19036491|Individuals with autism spectrum disorders -LRB- ASD -RRB- are impaired in social interaction , show deficits in face and emotion processing , show amygdala abnormalities and display a disadvantage in the perception of social threat .

19028592|The amygdala modulates the consolidation of memories of emotionally arousing experiences .

19019455|The amygdala plays an important role in the regulation of emotions and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorders .

19015115|This has led to the proposal that amygdala activity might be an indicator of emotional arousal , at least in the chemosensory domain .

19015115|The proposed difference in the relation between amygdala activity and stimulus-related arousal between the chemosensory and the audiovisual domain is discussed in terms of the amygdala 's embedding within these sensory systems and the processes by which emotional meaning is derived .

19015105|Results demonstrated -LRB- i -RRB- that both tasks activated anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula , consistent with prior work ; -LRB- ii -RRB- whereas self-pain activated anterior and mid insula regions implicated in interoception and nociception , other pain activated frontal , premotor , parietal and amygdala regions implicated in emotional learning and processing social cues ; and -LRB- iii -RRB- that levels of trait anxiety correlated with activity in rostral lateral prefrontal cortex during perception of other pain but not during self-pain .

19015086|Emerging data on the neural mechanisms of impulse control highlight brain regions involved in emotion and decision making , including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- , anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- and amygdala .

19015082|The role of the amygdala in implicit evaluation of emotionally neutral faces . .

19015082|We examined whether the amygdala is engaged during the evaluation of emotionally neutral faces along trait-specific dimensions such as trustworthiness and attractiveness or along a general valence dimension .

19014547|The putative neural circuit of aggressive motivation identified with fMRI includes neural substrates contributing to emotional expression -LRB- i.e. cortical and medial amygdala , BNST , lateral hypothalamus -RRB- , emotional experience -LRB- i.e. hippocampus , forebrain cortex , anterior cingulate , retrosplenial cortex -RRB- and the anterior thalamic nuclei that bridge the motor and cognitive components of aggressive responding .

19001247|Our findings , together with previously published data , suggest that foreign language ictal speech automatisms are more likely to occur in men with nondominant amygdala onset seizures , an observation that might reflect the sexual dimorphism observed in the right amygdala during emotional processing .

18985136|Recent studies suggest the involvement of frontal cortical regions in the modulation of amygdala reactivity and the mediation of effective emotion regulation .

18985133|Across subjects , amygdala responses to emotional bodies positively correlated with the modulation of body-selective areas .

18985133|Together , these results suggest that emotional cues from body movements produce topographically selective influences on category-specific populations of neurons in visual cortex , and these increases may implicate discrete modulatory projections from the amygdala .

18985107|It is hypothesized that the rule-breaking behavior common to antisocial , violent and psychopathic individuals is in part due to impairments in some of the structures -LRB- dorsal and ventral PFC , amygdala and angular gyrus -RRB- subserving moral cognition and emotion .

18982530|We determined whether effective connectivity of amygdala with medial orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- MOFC -RRB- and lateral orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- LOFC -RRB- differentiates the perception of emotion faces in a manner consistent with the dimensional and/or categorical view .

18982530|Greater effective connectivity from right LOFC to amygdala differentiated emotion expressions conducive to perceiver approach -LRB- happy , neutral , and fear -RRB- from angry expressions that elicit perceiver withdrawal .

18980734|The hippocampus and amygdala are key limbic regions for memory formation and emotion modulation that are potentially involved in the cognitive and affective symptoms of bipolar disorder .

18980734|In adults , it is unclear whether hippocampal volumes are abnormal , whereas the amygdala is reported to be larger and hyperactive to external emotional stimuli .

18978778|Our results suggest that individual dopamine storage capacity in amygdala subserves modulation of emotional processing in amygdala and dorsal cingulate , thereby contributing to individual differences in anxious temperament .

18977415|In WIN-treated rats , an increase in CNR1 transcript levels was observed in the hypothalamus and striatum , whereas in the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex , brain regions involved in emotional processing , a decrease was observed .

18973598|The basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- plays a key role in emotional arousal and anxiety , and expresses high levels of corticotropin-releasing factor receptor -LRB- CRFR -RRB- 1 .

18958192|The basolateral nucleus -LRB- BLA -RRB- of the amygdala contributes to the consolidation of memories for emotional or stressful events .

18958190|We tested two inbred mouse strains -LRB- BALB/c , C57BL/6J ; male ; 3-month-old -RRB- for glucocorticoid stress system markers -LRB- expression of MR and GR mRNA and protein in hippocampus , amygdala , and prefrontal cortex ; blood plasma corticosterone -RRB- , used behavioral tasks for emotions and cognitive performance -LRB- elevated plus maze , holeboard -RRB- to assess the interdependence of these factors .

18950748|This study explored these gene-brain associations in adolescents by examining predictive effects of serotonin transporter gene variants -LRB- S and L -LRB- G -RRB- allele carriers vs. L -LRB- A -RRB- allele homozygotes -RRB- and their interaction with diagnosis -LRB- healthy vs. patients -RRB- on amygdala responses to emotional faces .

18948174|The basolateral nuclear complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLC -RRB- receives a dense dopaminergic innervation that plays a critical role in the formation of emotional memory .

18938187|Persisting neuroadaptions in the amygdala as a result of chronic alcohol use have been associated with negative emotional states that may lead to increased alcohol intake .

18930182|Participants who are instructed to use reappraisal to downregulate negative emotion show decreased amygdala responses and increased prefrontal responses .

18930182|Greater use of reappraisal in everyday life was related to decreased amygdala activity and increased prefrontal and parietal activity during the processing of negative emotional facial expressions .

18930036|Fourteen healthy participants -LRB- 7 women -RRB- performed a perceptual matching task of negative emotional faces -LRB- angry and fearful -RRB- and geometric shapes that was designed for functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- studies to maximize amygdala activation .

18925984|The amygdala is considered crucial in emotional modulation and stronger amygdala reactivity in response to fearful stimuli has been found in carriers of the short -LRB- S -RRB- allele of the 5-HTT gene in imaging studies .

18854439|Because the cingulate cortex and amygdala are involved in emotion processing , gray matter loss in these regions may contribute to the development of early behavioral symptoms of SSPE .

18849132|Although we were unable to replicate past research demonstrating relatively increased amygdala activation among individuals with an '' s '' allele to negative stimuli , women with an s allele evidenced decreased left fusiform gyrus activation to positive emotional stimuli -LRB- as expected -RRB- .

18838042|This review summarizes information about the structure and function of the amygdala with attention to its role in experienced emotion and mood .

18838040|The amygdala , striatum , and structures within the prefrontal cortex are highly involved in mediating these stages of emotion processing , and evidence indicates that these regions show structural and functional alterations in different types of psychopathology , including anxiety , depression , and autism spectrum disorders .

18838037|Using functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- , we compared 12 adolescents with Cushing syndrome with 22 healthy control adolescents on amygdala and anterior hippocampus activation during an emotional faces encoding task .

18835399|We have previously found that synaptic pathway from the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- to the dentate gyrus -LRB- DG -RRB- displays N-methyl-D-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- receptor-independent form of long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- , which should be a valuable model for elucidating neural mechanisms linking emotion and memory .

18829960|This representation of state value could underlie how the amygdala helps coordinate cognitive , emotional , and behavioral responses depending on the value of one 's state .

18827720|Neurofunctional and neuropathologic studies have implicated the amygdala as a primary brain structure involved in the regulation of emotion .

18826444|Our results for individuals from an Asian population countered a previous finding for a Caucasian population and identified the moderating role of genetic background in the relationships between these serotonergic gene polymorphisms and amygdala function elicited by negative emotional stimuli .

18823167|The model addresses how brain regions responsible for affective learning and habit learning interact and answers a central question : What are the relative contributions of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex to emotion and behavior ?

18823167|Interactions of the basal ganglia and amygdala with sensory and orbitofrontal cortices enable the model to replicate the complex pattern of spared and impaired behavioral and emotional capacities seen following lesions of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex .

18818053|Our findings suggest that the persistence of AHs in schizophrenia may induce functional disturbances of the emotion-related interconnected neural networks , including reduced responsiveness in the amygdala and hippocampus to negative stimuli .

18817740|Results identified two separable pathways that together explained approximately 50 % of the reported variance in self-reported emotion : -LRB- 1 -RRB- a path through nucleus accumbens that predicted greater reappraisal success , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- a path through ventral amygdala that predicted reduced reappraisal success -LRB- i.e. , more negative emotion -RRB- .

18817724|In this issue of Neuron , Wager et al. use a novel mediation analysis of neuroimaging data to show two independent pathways for the control of emotion by the prefrontal cortex : a path through the amygdala predicts a greater negative emotional response , and a path through the nucleus accumbens/ventral striatum predicts a greater positive response .

18809501|Evidence for endogenous opioid release in the amygdala during positive emotion . .

18807934|The limbic system -LRB- comprising the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex -RRB- and the prefrontal cortex -LRB- the orbital and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices -RRB- have been implicated in emotional and behavioral control .

18804514|A test of the interaction between derogatory emotion and its self-directedness revealed significant activation of the amygdala .

18804514|Our findings indicate an important role of the amygdala in the processing of unpleasant emotion or self-relevance of information in the real world may also be expanded to the processing of self-directedness of unpleasant emotion in the imagined world , and thereby contribute to human higher social cognitive process .

18804183|The perception of and memory for faces , with or without emotional content , were studied in 43 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy who had undergone unilateral resection of the hippocampus and the amygdala and in 43 healthy participants for comparison .

18793699|This modulation could be distinguished from effects of emotion dimensions -LRB- e.g. valence , intensity -RRB- and evoked effects of self-relatedness during the stimulus period itself the latter being observed rather in subcortical regions , e.g. amygdala , ventral striatum , and tectum .

18789345|The mesiotemporal lobe is involved in decision making processes because bilateral amygdala damage can cause impairments in decision making that is mainly based on the processing of emotional feedback .

18787229|We found that the mirror neuron system , the insula and amygdala were more active during emotional expressions , that this circuit is engaged to a greater extent when interacting with one 's own child , and that it is correlated with maternal reflective function -LRB- a measure of empathy -RRB- .

18786365|Our results suggest that the lateral PFC regions engaged by cognitive emotion regulation strategies may influence the amygdala , diminishing fear through similar vmPFC connections that are thought to inhibit the amygdala during extinction .

18775476|However , it has been reported that the human amygdala responds to multiple expressions of emotions as well as emotionally neutral stimuli of a novel , uncertain or ambiguous nature .

18771714|As compared to HC , SPP showed increased neural activity not only in regions involved in emotional processing including left amygdala and insula , as expected from previous reports , but also in the bilateral superior temporal sulcus -LRB- STS -RRB- , a part of the core system for face perception that is involved in the evaluation of expression and personal traits .

18759550|While we are at a preliminary stage in understanding the neural circuitry behind emotional processing , there appears to be a top-down regulation of affect with prefrontal systems modulating subcortical structures such as the amygdala and the ventral striatum .

18756965|The main centers affected in the NERD-H patients included the secondary somatosensory cortex -LRB- SII -RRB- , primary somatosensory cortex -LRB- S1 -RRB- , right prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- , right orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- , insular cortex , amygdala , striatum , motor cortex and its supplementary area , and cerebellum cortices , which form part of the matrix controlling emotional , autonomic modulatory responses to pain .

18756092|Patients and controls showed significant differences in signal dynamics between excitatory and inhibitory components of the negative feedback loop that controls emotional arousal , specifically between the right amygdala and Brodmann area 9 -LRB- BA9 -RRB- , when viewing angry facial expressions -LRB- p = 0.002 -RRB- .

18725236|The negative emotional state that drives such negative reinforcement is hypothesized to derive from dysregulation of key neurochemical elements involved in reward and stress within the basal forebrain structures involving the ventral striatum and extended amygdala .

18723260|The results also suggest that the amygdala is associated with self-referential processing of both positive and negative emotional stimuli .

18722390|Neuroimaging studies have shown that altered decision-making in addiction is associated with abnormal functioning of a distributed neural network critical for the processing of emotional information , and the experience of '' craving '' , including the VMPC , the amygdala , the striatum , the anterior cingulate cortex , and the insular/somato-sensory cortices , as well as non-specific neurotransmitter systems that modulate activities of neural processes involved in decision-making .

18722390|We conclude that there are at least two underlying types of dysfunction where emotional signals -LRB- somatic markers -RRB- turn in favor of immediate outcomes in addiction : -LRB- 1 -RRB- a hyperactivity in the amygdala or impulsive system , which exaggerates the rewarding impact of available incentives , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- hypoactivity in the prefrontal cortex or reflective system , which forecasts the long-term consequences of a given action .

18717814|The findings in nucleus accumbens may reflect dopaminergic motor-stimulant activity caused by acute cocaine , whereas the effects in amygdala may be associated with changes in emotional state that occur after acute and chronic cocaine exposure .

18717711|We used functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- to investigate the role of the amygdala in processing emotions in TLE and whether this may be a potential preoperative predictive marker for emotional disturbances following surgery .

18717711|Activation of the right amygdala preoperatively was predictive of emotional disturbances following right ATLR .

18698320|As CRF expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- is important in adaptation to chronic stress , we hypothesized that unrestrained synthesis of CRF in CeA would mimic the consequences of chronic stress exposure and cause dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal -LRB- HPA -RRB- axis , increase emotionality and disrupt reproduction .

18691703|There was significant activation in the superior temporal gyrus -LRB- STG -RRB- ; inferior frontal gyrus -LRB- IFG -RRB- ; and parahippocampal gyrus , including the amygdala , under the bimodal versus the unimodal condition , irrespective of the emotional content .

18685152|In addition to its rewarding properties , nicotine also affects many cognitive and emotional processes that involve several brain regions , including hippocampus and amygdala .

18685152|Here , we study the effect of chronic oral administration of nicotine on the long-term synaptic potentiation in the amygdala , a key structure for emotional memory .

18675521|Facial emotion recognition and amygdala activation are associated with menstrual cycle phase . .

18675521|Here we explored the association of ovarian hormone levels and amygdala activation during an explicit emotion recognition task in two groups of healthy young females : one group was measured while in their follicular phase -LRB- n = 11 -RRB- and the other during their luteal phase -LRB- n = 11 -RRB- .

18675521|From an evolutionary point of view this significant influence of ovarian hormone level on emotion processing and an important neural correlate , the amygdala , may enable a higher social sensitivity in females during their follicular phase , thus facilitating socio-emotional behavior -LRB- and social interaction -RRB- which may possibly facilitate mating behavior as well .

18662324|Dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- receptor and NMDA receptor -LRB- NMDAR -RRB- activation in the lateral -LRB- LA -RRB- nucleus of the amygdala plays a critical role in emotional processing .

18657626|Noradrenergic activation of the basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- modulates the consolidation of memory for many kinds of highly emotionally arousing training tasks .

18650022|We compared the effects of bilateral amygdala , hippocampal or orbital frontal cortex lesions on emotional and hormonal reactivity in rhesus monkeys -LRB- Macaca mulatta -RRB- .

18650022|These results indicate that the amygdala , hippocampus and orbital frontal cortex play distinct , yet complimentary roles in coordinating emotional and hormonal reactivity to threat .

18646623|Functional neuroimaging has also shown that emotional information of episodic memory enhances amygdala-MTL correlations and that this enhancement is observed during both the encoding and retrieval of emotional memories .

18640918|Cognitive and emotional consequences of binge drinking : role of amygdala and prefrontal cortex . .

18639564|Finally , association of the G -LRB- -1019 -RRB- allele with increased raphe 5-HT1A binding potential , increased amygdala reactivity to emotional stimuli , and reduced amygdala volume , particularly in disease states , suggests a functional role for the C -LRB- -1019 -RRB- G site in 5-HT1A receptor dys-regulation and predisposition to mental illness .

18637598|It has been suggested that emotion can significantly enhance learning by producing memories that are processed and stored via the amygdaloid complex which is relatively impervious to extinction and thus forgetting .

18635342|Functional imaging studies have shown that individuals with borderline personality disorder -LRB- BPD -RRB- display prefrontal and amygdala dysfunction while viewing or listening to emotional or traumatic stimuli .

18633835|If confirmed , this demonstration of amygdala and hippocampus activation in a Lie > Truth contrast illustrates the need to integrate the limbic system and its emotional and cognitive correlates into the existing model of deception .

18633822|Compared to emotionally neutral agency , different categories of moral emotions led to distinct activation patterns : -LRB- 1 -RRB- prosocial emotions -LRB- guilt , embarrassment , compassion -RRB- activated the anterior medial PFC and STS , with -LRB- 2 -RRB- empathic emotions -LRB- guilt and compassion -RRB- additionally recruiting the mesolimbic pathway ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- other-critical emotions -LRB- disgust and indignation -RRB- were associated with activation of the amygdala-parahippocampal and fusiform areas .

18633816|The inferior frontal gyrus -LRB- IFG -RRB- and posterior parietal cortex have been considered to compose a mirror neuron system -LRB- MNS -RRB- for the motor components of facial expressions , while the amygdala and insula may represent an '' additional '' MNS for emotional states .

18633816|Using movies , fear activated the amygdala and disgust the insula , but other emotions activated these structures to a similar degree .

18633799|Impaired recognition of negative basic emotions in autism : a test of the amygdala theory . .

18633799|This is thought to be related to atypical function and structure of the amygdala , and performance by people with ASC on emotion recognition tasks resembles that seen in people with acquired amygdala damage .

18633792|A minority have impaired social responsiveness , poor discrimination of facial emotions -LRB- especially fear -RRB- , and abnormal amygdala-cortical connectivity .

18633776|Specifically , the superior temporal sulcus -LRB- STS -RRB- , known to play a critical role in the visual detection of action , is extensively interconnected with the amygdala , a center for emotion processing .

18633776|To the extent that amygdala activity influences STS activity , one would expect to find systematic differences in the visual detection of emotional actions .

18621068|We highlight findings in brain areas that show some consistency or complementarity across studies , such as the ventrolateral orbitofrontal cortex where modulation by 5-HT is task-specific , and the amygdala in emotional processing where 5-HT is predominantly inhibitory .

18617194|Given that the amygdala is a major emotional center in the brain and regulates the expression of both learned fear and anxiety , neurotransmitter systems within the basolateral amygdala represent likely mechanisms governing the anxiety-related effects of acute ethanol exposure .

18615136|Imaging studies have shown that impaired decision-making in addiction is associated with abnormal functioning of a distributed neural network critical for the processing of emotional information , including the ventromedial cortex , the amygdala , the striatum , the anterior cingulate cortex , and the insular/somato-sensory cortices , as well as non-specific neurotransmitter systems that modulate activities of neural processes involved in decision-making .

18614671|A polymorphism in the human serotonin transporter -LRB- 5-HTT -RRB- gene is implicated in susceptibility to anxiety and depression and in enhanced emotion-induced activation in the amygdala .

18614265|Relative to the control and depressed groups the PTSD group exhibited greater sensitivity to correctly recognised stimuli in the left amygdala/ventral striatum and right occipital cortex , and more specific sensitivity to items encoded in emotional contexts in the right precuneus , left superior frontal gyrus , and bilateral insula .

18614169|The central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- is a critical coordinator of autonomic , behavioral , and emotional systems impacted by opioids , however there is no evidence that the essential NMDA-NR1 -LRB- NR1 -RRB- subunit gene in the amygdala plays a role in opioid dependence .

18604284|Its role in fear conditioning has been confirmed , but the human amygdala also interacts with cortical regions to mediate other aspects of emotional memory .

18603301|Amygdala activity and strength of amygdala-cingulate FC during emotional face processing were contrasted between the groups .

18603301|Although both groups activated the extended amygdala -LRB- EA -RRB- during emotion processing , the MDD relative to the HC group showed more task-related co-activation of the subgenual cingulate , which is involved in processing negative self-referential information ; and less co-activation of the supragenual cingulate , which is involved in the cognitive control of emotion .

18603005|The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism affects amygdala activity in response to emotional stimuli : evidence from a genetic imaging study . .

18603005|Carriers of the 66Met variant showed stronger amygdala activation in the right hemisphere in response to emotional stimuli compared to neutral stimuli .

18599044|In the present study , we assessed emotional behaviour and performed a structural analysis of the amygdala -LRB- AMY -RRB- in neuropathic rats after two months of hyperalgesia and allodynia , induced by the spared nerve injury model -LRB- SNI -RRB- .

18594696|The amygdala expresses marked developmental plasticity and plays instrumental roles in processing emotional information , regulating emotion-related behaviors and orchestrating biobehavioral stress responses throughout life .

18586524|These results are in line with an amygdala-prefrontal-cingulate network controlling different appraisal levels , and suggest a specific role of the left inferior frontal gyrus in explicit evaluation of emotional prosody .

18580572|Direct contrasts between-race emotional faces -LRB- happy and sad -RRB- also showed differential effects : the contrast of own-race relative to other-race had more activations in limbic areas -LRB- amygdala and hippocampus -RRB- , whereas the contrast of other-race relative to own-race had more activations in frontal , occipital , and parietal lobes .

18579737|Extensive evidence indicates that stress hormone effects on the consolidation of emotionally influenced memory involve noradrenergic activation of the basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

18565602|The amygdala and emotional modulation of competition between cognitive and habit memory . .

18565602|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is implicated in the neurobiology of emotion , and can also modulate the cognitive and habit memory processes mediated by the hippocampus and dorsal striatum , respectively .

18563394|The present study examined the effects of bilateral infusions of GRP or its receptor antagonist -LRB- RC-3095 -RRB- into the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- on the conditioned emotional response .

18562330|We show that , during imitation of angry facial expressions , reduced feedback due to BTX treatment attenuates activation of the left amygdala and its functional coupling with brain stem regions implicated in autonomic manifestations of emotional states .

18544183|The amygdala plays a pivotal role in a cortico-limbic circuitry implicated in emotion processing and regulation .

18544183|In the present study , functional connectivity of the amygdala with prefrontal areas involved in emotion regulation was investigated during a facial expression processing task in a sample of 34 depressed inpatients and 31 healthy controls .

18541279|Additionally , emotion attribution induced left amygdala activity .

18541279|Furthermore , the involvement of the amygdala in the ToM precursor ability to link facial expressions with an emotional situation may indicate that the amygdala is involved in the development of stable ToM abilities .

18539249|In this functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- study , the focus was on the amygdala activation and we investigated whether individual differences in activity of the amygdala following presentation of emotional expressions in the face and the whole body may be systematically related to the presence of Type D -LRB- distressed -RRB- personality or to its constituting factors , Negative Affectivity -LRB- NA -RRB- and Social Inhibition -LRB- SI -RRB- .

18538210|It has been suggested that emotion can significantly enhance learning by producing memories that are processed and stored via the amygdaloid complex , which are relatively impervious to extinction and thus forgetting .

18533199|The amygdala plays an important role in the emotional-affective component of pain and in pain modulation .

18515899|To investigate episodic emotional memory in bipolar disorder , as indicated by performance on an amygdala-related cognitive task .

18511957|In all , unilateral damage to the amygdala and medial temporal lobe results in subtle emotion recognition impairments , but these deficits do not appear to extend to self-reported impairments in everyday interpersonal behavior .

18504635|Since amygdala activation is central for emotional valuation , arousal , and salience , we investigated the activation profile of this structure in 10 male subjects with pedophilia -LRB- exclusively attracted to boys -RRB- , all convicted sex-offenders and sentenced to forensic psychiatric treatment along with ten male heterosexual matched controls .

18503512|As emotional events appear to gain preference during encoding , via the modulatory effect of amygdala on prefrontal and medial temporal lobe regions , conscious retrieval of emotional pictures -LRB- relative to neutral ones -RRB- was expected to be less disrupted by sleep loss .

18503512|Taken together , these results suggest that emotion and sleep influence differentially the subjective experience of remembering and knowing and the underlying processes of recollection and familiarity through brain mechanisms probably involving amygdala - and hippocampo-neocortical networks respectively .

18490926|Using an imaging genetics approach in a sample of 121 volunteers studied with an emotional face-matching paradigm , we found that differential activation of amygdala is observed in carriers of risk alleles for RS3 and RS1 .

18486975|Multiple lines of evidence converge on the human amygdala as a core moderator of facial emotion perception .

18486975|The major subregions of the human amygdala have been anatomically delineated , but the individual contribution of these subregions to facial emotion perception is unclear .

18486975|We localized facial emotion-related signal changes in the basolateral and superficial -LRB- cortical -RRB- subregions of the left amygdala , with most robust responses observed to happy faces .

18486975|Our findings extend current models of facial emotion perception in humans by suggesting an intrinsic functional differentiation within the amygdala related to the extraction of value from facial expressions .

18469802|The lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is important for assigning emotional and motivational significance to discrete environmental cues , including those that signal rewarding events .

18466987|Differential amygdala activation to negative and positive emotional pictures during an indirect task . .

18459448|A main characteristic of emotion-related brain regions -LRB- orbitofrontal cortex , anterior cingulated cortex , amygdala , insula -RRB- is their reciprocal anatomical connectivity with each other as well as with neuromodulatory systems -LRB- e.g. , serotonergic dorsal raphe , cholinergic nucleus basalis of Meynert , and dopaminergic ventral tegmentum -RRB- and with other brain areas involved in sensory , motor , and cognitive functions .

18457884|The present paper examines the long-term effects of soman poisoning on emotional reactivity in mice , 30 or 90 days after intoxication using behavioral tasks involving amygdala function .

18455837|Compared to young adults , older adults had greater functional connectivity between the right amygdala and ventral anterior cingulate cortex , possibly reflecting increased emotional regulation .

18450481|Functional connectivity results from partial least squares analyses provided support for the hypothesized involvement of 3 networks corresponding to : 1 -RRB- visceral afferent information proces sing -LRB- thalamus , insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex , orbital frontal cortex -RRB- , 2 -RRB- emotional-arousal -LRB- amygdala , rostral and subgenual cingulate regions , and locus coeruleus complex -RRB- and 3 -RRB- cortical modulation -LRB- frontal and parietal cortices -RRB- .

18446827|Additionally , the role of the amygdala in emotional response makes it a possible region for investigation in children and adults with childhood maltreatment-related PTSD .

18440204|Influence of the catechol-O-methyltransferase val158met genotype on amygdala and prefrontal cortex emotional processing in panic disorder . .

18440204|Our data provide preliminary evidence for a role of the functional val158met COMT polymorphism in amygdala and prefrontal activation in response to emotional faces in panic disorder .

18440037|These observations provide further support for the view that psychophysiological emotional responses do not modulate cognitive processes normally in ASD and further implicate abnormalities of amygdala connectivity -LRB- in particular with the hippocampus -RRB- in the neuropathology underlying this disorder .

18439411|In the unstable hierarchy setting , additional regions related to emotional processing -LRB- amygdala -RRB- , social cognition -LRB- medial prefrontal cortex -RRB- , and behavioral readiness were recruited .

18434283|The amygdala is critical for the formation of stimulus-reinforcement associations , both punishment and reward based , and the processing of emotional expressions .

18417227|In the companion paper -LRB- see part 2 -RRB- , the possible effects of both long-term neuropathology and delayed neuronal regeneration were evaluated on amygdala-driven emotional processes .

18414599|The amygdala has been implicated in emotional processes , although the precise nature of the emotional deficits following amygdala lesions remains to be fully elucidated .

18414599|To address this issue , measures of emotional arousal and valence -LRB- positivity and negativity -RRB- to a graded series of emotional pictures were obtained from patients with lesions of the amygdala and from a clinical contrast group with lesions that spared this structure .

18414599|The relative lack of emotional arousal to negative stimuli may account for many of the clinical features of amygdala lesions .

18414408|Furthermore , functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- studies reveal that s carriers have increased amygdala reactivity in response to aversive stimuli , which is thought to be an intermediate phenotype mediating the influences of the s allele on emotionality .

18411708|We demonstrated the differential patterns of c-fos mRNA induction by chemical somatic -LRB- formalin -RRB- and visceral -LRB- acetic acid -RRB- noxious stimuli in the rat amygdaloid nuclei , the brain regions implicated in emotion .

18400885|A major site of extrahypothalamic expression of corticotropin-releasing factor -LRB- CRF -RRB- and its G-protein-coupled CRF1 and CRF2 receptors is the amygdala , a key player in emotions and affective disorders .

18400885|Pain-related plasticity in the laterocapsular division of the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeLC -RRB- generates emotional-affective responses and anxiety-like behavior .

18396414|Functional brain imaging studies have shown deviant amygdala responses to emotional stimuli in subjects suffering from anxiety and depressive disorder , but both hyperactivity and hypoactivity compared to healthy controls have been reported .

18396414|To test this hypothesis , we assessed amygdala responses to an emotional faces paradigm during functional magnetic resonance imaging in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for the risk of anxiety and depression -LRB- n = 10 pairs -RRB- and in monozygotic twin pairs concordant for high -LRB- n = 7 pairs -RRB- or low -LRB- n = 15 pairs -RRB- risk for anxiety and depression .

18388767|Attention to other people 's eyes is reduced in young people with high psychopathic traits , thus accounting for their problems with fear recognition , and is consistent with amygdala dysfunction failing to promote attention to emotional salience in the environment .

18385673|Lower haplotype-driven NPY expression predicted higher emotion-induced activation of the amygdala , as well as diminished resiliency as assessed by pain/stress-induced activations of endogenous opioid neurotransmission in various brain regions .

18385330|Working memory for social cues recruits orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala : a functional magnetic resonance imaging study of delayed matching to sample for emotional expressions . .

18385330|Neuroanatomically , our predictions focused on the orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- and the amygdala , as these regions have previously been implicated in emotional processing and long-term memory , and studies have demonstrated sustained OFC and medial temporal lobe activity during visual WM. Consistent with previous studies , transient activity during the sample period representing emotion and identity was found in the superior temporal sulcus and inferior occipital cortex , respectively .

18385330|Sustained delay-period activity was evident in OFC , amygdala , and hippocampus , for both emotion and identity trials .

18385330|These results suggest that , although initial processing of emotion and identity is accomplished in anatomically segregated temporal and occipital regions , sustained delay related memory for these two critical features is held by the OFC , amygdala and hippocampus .

18375769|Numerous functional MRI -LRB- fMRI -RRB- studies in humans have shown enhanced responses to faces with different emotional valence , in both the amygdala and the visual cortex .

18375529|Role of amygdala connectivity in the persistence of emotional memories over time : an event-related FMRI investigation . .

18375529|According to the consolidation hypothesis , enhanced memory for emotional information reflects the modulatory effect of the amygdala on the medial temporal lobe -LRB- MTL -RRB- memory system during consolidation .

18375529|Although there is evidence that amygdala-MTL connectivity enhances memory for emotional stimuli , it remains unclear whether this enhancement increases over time , as consolidation processes unfold .

18375529|Activity in the amygdala predicted subsequent memory to a greater extent for emotional than neutral pictures .

18375529|Although this advantage did not vary with delay , the contribution of amygdala-MTL connectivity to subsequent memory for emotional items increased over time .

18375529|Moreover , both this increase in connectivity and amygdala activity itself were correlated with individual differences in recollection persistence for emotional but not neutral pictures .

18375529|These results suggest that the amygdala and its connectivity with the MTL are critical to sustaining emotional memories over time , consistent with the consolidation hypothesis .

18367339|The indirect amygdala-dorsal striatum pathway mediates conditioned freezing : insights on emotional memory networks . .

18367339|Given the well-acknowledged role of the amygdala in emotional learning , we also examined a possible cooperation between DS and the amygdala in TFC , by using asymmetrical electrolytic lesions , consisting of a unilateral lesion of the central amygdaloid nucleus -LRB- CeA -RRB- combined to a contralateral DS lesion .

18365029|The comparison between meditation vs. rest states between experts and novices also showed increased activation in amygdala , right temporo-parietal junction -LRB- TPJ -RRB- , and right posterior superior temporal sulcus -LRB- pSTS -RRB- in response to all sounds , suggesting , greater detection of the emotional sounds , and enhanced mentation in response to emotional human vocalizations for experts than novices during meditation .

18336570|Previous studies have shown that distinct neuronal pathways modulate different emotional behaviours : while the amygdala plays a key role in fear-conditioned-to-cue stimuli , the bed nucleus of stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- is implicated in anxiety behaviour and responses to contextual stimuli .

18331915|However , current ideas about the function of the amygdala do not pay sufficient attention to its chemosensory role , but only view it as the core of the emotional brain .

18331915|In this study , we propose that both roles of the amygdala are intimately linked since the amygdala is actually involved in mediating emotional responses to chemical signals .

18331872|These circuits , which have not changed substantially in birds despite the disappearance of the vomeronasal system , delineate two functional divisions within the amygdala that , together , orchestrate the expression of species-specific behaviours with a strong emotional component .

18329905|In contrast , activation in other regions like the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex , the mediodorsal thalamus and the amygdala was associated only with a general emotional component during sexual arousal .

18329779|Several studies point to a role of the serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism in amygdala activation during emotion perception .

18327828|RESULTS / CONCLUSION : Children display similar structural aberrations of fronto-limbic structures to adults with antisocial behavior , and amygdala dysfunction might be closely related to dysregulated emotions .

18326309|-LSB- Impaired recognition of emotion improved by L-DOPA in a patient with amygdala damage -RSB- . .

18326309|We examined the effect of levodopa -LRB- L-DOPA -RRB- in a patient with a lesion of the amygdala and impaired recognition of emotion .

18326309|We hypothesized that L-DOPA may have activated dopaminergic systems involved in recognition of emotion such as the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex , compensating for the amygdala dysfunction .

18323572|A functional network , different for each attention condition , connected this region and the amygdala , which was associated with emotion and EEM , but not with voluntary attention .

18316676|In independent samples , RGS2 markers , including rs4606 , which has previously been associated with RGS2 expression , were also associated with introversion -LRB- a core personality trait in social anxiety disorder -RRB- and with increased limbic activation -LRB- insular cortex and amygdala -RRB- during emotion processing -LRB- brain phenotypes correlated with social anxiety -RRB- .

18316676|The genotype at rs4606 explained 10 % to 15 % of the variance in amygdala and insular cortex activation to emotional faces .

18316124|The role of the amygdala in emotional processing : a quantitative meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies . .

18316124|Functional neuroimaging studies have provided strong support for a critical role of the amygdala in emotional processing .

18316124|To address these issues , we conducted a meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies of visual emotional perception that reported amygdala activation .

18314269|In the present study automatic amygdala reactivity to facial emotion was investigated as a function of alexithymia -LRB- as assessed by the 20-Item Toronto Alexithymia Scale -RRB- .

18314269|Masked sad and happy facial emotions led to greater right amygdala activation than masked neutral faces .

18314269|Reduced automatic amygdala responsivity may contribute to problems in identifying one 's emotions in everyday life .

18314269|Low spontaneous reactivity of the amygdala to sad faces could implicate less engagement in the encoding of negative emotional stimuli .

18308474|The amygdala modulates memory consolidation with the storage of emotionally relevant information and plays a critical role in fear and anxiety .

18302724|In contrast , the vulnerable group had more activation of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and less activation of the ventral striatum and extended amygdala , bilaterally , to emotional stimuli than the control and resilient groups .

18299209|When vocal processing gets emotional : on the role of social orientation in relevance detection by the human amygdala . .

18299209|Previous work on vocal emotional processing provided little evidence for involvement of emotional processing areas such as the amygdala or the orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- .

18299209|Processing differences between emotional and neutral vocal change in the right amygdala and the bilateral OFC were significantly correlated with the social orientation measure .

18299209|Specifically , higher social orientation scores were associated with enhanced amygdala and OFC activity to emotional as compared to neutral change .

18299209|Given the presumed role of the amygdala in the detection of emotionally relevant information , our results suggest that social orientation enhances this detection process and the activation of emotional representations mediated by the OFC .

18298251|The central nucleus -LRB- CE -RRB- of the amygdala has been gaining attention for its importance in the plasticity underlying conditioned emotional responding .

18295746|A number of recent studies have reported decreased amygdala activation in schizophrenia to emotional stimuli -LRB- such as fearful faces -RRB- compared with matched neutral stimuli -LRB- such as neutral faces -RRB- .

18294820|The pattern of reduced activation of ventrolateral PFC and greater amygdala activation in bipolar children in response to negative stimuli suggests both disinhibition of emotional reactivity in the limbic system and reduced function in PFC systems that regulate those responses .

18283492|The monoamines in the amygdala modulate multiple aspects of emotional processing in the mammalian brain , and organic or pharmacological dysregulation of these systems can result in affective pathologies .

18281412|Extensive work implicates abnormal amygdala activation in emotional facial expression processing in adults with callous-unemotional traits .

18281412|However , no research has examined amygdala response to emotional facial expressions in adolescents with disruptive behavior and callous-unemotional traits .

18279323|Anatomical evidence suggests an interplay between the dorsal CA1 of the hippocampus -LRB- CA1 -RRB- , the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and the entorhinal cortex -LRB- EC -RRB- , but their specific interactions in the context of emotional memory remain obscure .

18261932|Sequence of information processing for emotions through pathways linking temporal and insular cortices with the amygdala . .

18261932|The amygdala has a pivotal role in deciphering the emotional significance of sensory stimuli enabling emotional memory formation .

18261932|These findings may help explain how the amygdala can attach emotional value to environmental stimuli , participate in the sequence of information processing of emotions , and modulate the formation of emotional memories .

18257652|The amygdala is a complex structure playing primary role in the processing and memorizing of emotional reactions .

18257652|Impairment of emotional event memory in patients with Alzheimer 's disease also correlates with the intensity of amygdalar damage .

18249422|The amygdala has been implicated in the recognition of facial emotions , especially fearful expressions , in adults with early-onset right temporal lobe epilepsy -LRB- TLE -RRB- .

18248258|In contrast , the medial pallium , considered homologous to the amygdala , is involved in emotional conditioning in teleost fish .

18243361|The changes in 5-HT activity found in the amygdala and periacqueductal gray matter indicate that 5-HT is involved in the emotional mechanisms activating a memory trace .

18243164|These data suggest a unique mode of synaptic transmission at amygdalar SP-containing terminals where slowly-acting SP is concentrated but both GABA and its synthetic enzyme are maintained at low levels , possibly underlying long-lasting responses in emotions .

18234519|The interference of operant task performance by emotional distracters : an antagonistic relationship between the amygdala and frontoparietal cortices . .

18234519|During a task demonstrating behavioural interference in the context of emotional distracters , increased activity in neural regions implicated in emotional processing -LRB- the amygdala -RRB- was associated with reduced activity in regions thought to be involved in exerting attentional control over task-relevant sensory representations -LRB- a frontoparietal network -RRB- .

18229785|The parabrachial nucleus acts in conjunction with the amygdala and insula -LRB- part of the medial temporal lobe system -RRB- to produce a somatic emotional sense that can result in a '' bad '' feeling .

18227504|It is hypothesized that emotional arousal modulates long-term memory consolidation through the amygdala .

18227504|The behavioral results show that 0.25 % sevoflurane blocks emotional memory , and connectivity results demonstrate that this dose of sevoflurane suppresses the effective influence of the amygdala .

18227504|Collectively , the findings support the hypothesis that the amygdala mediates memory modulation by demonstrating that suppressed amygdala effectiveness equates with a loss of emotional memory .

18226499|The amygdala , a temporal lobe structure that is most well known for its central role in emotional behavior , also plays a key role in epileptogenesis and epilepsy .

18211233|Moreover , the two conditions in which both the self and other were concerned by the harmful action -LRB- guilt and other-anger conditions -RRB- recruited emotional structures -LRB- i.e. , the bilateral amygdala , anterior cingulate , and basal ganglia -RRB- .

18209732|Popular examples are the amygdala in the domain of emotion and the lateral prefrontal cortex in the case of cognition .

18206186|It has been hypothesized that the amygdala mediates the processing advantage of emotional items .

18204824|Strong and discrete expression of their receptors in the extended amygdala suggests a potential role in regulating stress responses , emotion , anxiety and fear ; however , there have been no functional studies to date to support this possibility .

18191960|However , the amygdala is also closely embedded within this mesolimbic circuitry with reciprocal connections to the SN/VTA , raising the possibility that emotionally valenced stimuli might also interact with hippocampal encoding through dopaminergic neuromodulation .

18191960|By the same token , emotional processing in the amygdala might be affected by reward-related processing in the mesolimbic system .

18191116|As in earlier studies , blocked analysis of the facial emotion identification task showed activation of amygdala , fusiform , thalamus , inferior and midfrontal regions .

18181882|Evidence of perturbed amygdala functional connectivity with other brain regions would implicate a distributed neural circuit in the pathophysiology of BD , and would further elucidate the neural mechanisms associated with BD face emotion misinterpretation .

18178177|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is known to be involved in emotional and stress responses , while the dentate gyrus -LRB- DG -RRB- , a subfield of the hippocampus , is implicated in learning and memory .

18178177|These results indicate that neonatal isolation stress alters bidirectional neural plasticity in BLA-DG synapses , which may help to clarify the development of neural mechanisms linking emotional and stress responses in the amygdala with memory consolidation and information processing in the hippocampus .

18176635|In this review , we will focus on three such regions , namely the STS for its role in processing gaze and facial movements , the FFA in face detection and identification and the amygdala in processing facial expressions of emotion .

18175486|His processing of emotionally and socially meaningful information was impaired by the age of 20 , as it is in individuals with amygdala damage ; however , his performance on tasks requiring understanding a '' theory of mind '' improved by age 22 .

18175486|One may tentatively suggest that processing emotional signals , i.e. , functioning related to the amygdala , may not play an important role in the neural systems supporting development of understanding a '' theory of mind '' .

18174910|We observed reduced activity in the amygdala -LRB- AMY -RRB- and fusiform gyrus -LRB- FFG -RRB- to dynamic emotional expressions in people with autism .

20054425|The negative emotional state that drives such negative reinforcement is hypothesized to derive from dysregulation of key neurochemical elements involved in reward and stress within basal forebrain structures , including the ventral striatum and extended amygdala .

19543480|We propose that this rapid activation of the amygdala-hippocampus brain memory system results in a linear dose-response relation between emotional strength and memory formation .

18160226|It has been shown that both , stimuli with emotional/motivational content and the electrical stimulation the basolateral amygdala , can modulate hippocampal LTP .

18160182|We hypothesize that estrogen modifies the influence of the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex on emotion , but that age-related changes in the hippocampus prevent the enhancement of emotional memory in older women .

18094020|These results suggest -LRB- i -RRB- that hypothalamic HCRT activity physiologically modulates the processing of emotional inputs within the amygdala , and -LRB- ii -RRB- that suprapontine mechanisms of cataplexy involve a dysfunction of hypothalamic-amygdala interactions triggered by positive emotions .

18086830|Yet , the same stress hormones can facilitate memory for emotional information , which involves interactions between the hippocampus and amygdala .

18078530|Intact emotion facilitation for nonsocial stimuli in autism : is amygdala impairment in autism specific for social information ? .

18078530|Given the complexity of amygdala function and its known role in many other emotional tasks , we examined whether individuals with autism would demonstrate impaired performance on several tasks that have been shown to require activation of the amygdala but that do not have any explicit social meaning .

18078530|Future research regarding atypical amygdala function and emotion processing in autism should consider whether the response to nonsocial emotion factors -LRB- including negative valence or high arousal -RRB- may be intact , despite difficulties in responding to socially relevant stimuli .

18076995|Predictors of amygdala activation during the processing of emotional stimuli : a meta-analysis of 385 PET and fMRI studies . .

18076995|We conducted a meta-analysis of 385 functional neuroimaging studies of emotional processing , examining the effects of experimental characteristics on the probability of detecting amygdala activity .

18076995|All emotional stimuli were associated with higher probability of amygdala activity than neutral stimuli .

18072812|Impairment of neuroplasticity in the hippocampus , amygdala and cortex is hypothesized to be the mechanism by which cognitive function , learning , memory and emotions are altered in depression .

18070612|Imaging studies show that confronting human subjects with emotional stimuli results in increased amygdala activation and that this activation is noradrenergic dependent .

18068954|Trait anxiety and sex have been shown to separately account for some of the observed individual differences in amygdala responses to emotional stimuli , but the combined effect of both factors remains unknown .

18064583|We observed opposite parametric modulation of self-relatedness and emotion dimensions in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens , whereas neural activity in subcortical regions -LRB- tectum , right amygdala , hypothalamus -RRB- was modulated by self-relatedness and emotion dimensions in the same direction .

18063349|Several studies have implicated the involvement of two major components of emotion regulatory networks , the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- VLPFC -RRB- and amygdala , in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder .

18063349|In healthy subjects , the VLPFC has been shown to negatively modulate amygdala response when subjects cognitively evaluate an emotional face by identifying and labeling the emotion it expresses .

18063349|Compared with healthy subjects , manic patients had a significantly reduced VLPFC regulation of amygdala response during the emotion labeling task .

18058090|Escitalopram effects on insula and amygdala BOLD activation during emotional processing . .

18058090|The amygdala and insular cortex are integral to the processing of emotionally salient stimuli .

18058090|We hypothesized that subchronic -LRB- 21 days -RRB- SSRI treatment attenuates the activation of the amygdala and insula during processing of emotional faces .

18058090|After 21 days of treatment with either escitalopram or placebo , participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- during which all subjects completed an emotion face assessment task , which has been shown to elicit amygdala and insula activation .

18056543|Abnormal amygdala activation in schizophrenia in response to presentation of fearful faces is paradoxically associated with failure to recognize the emotion and with more severe flat affect .

18056238|In borderline patients , under conditions of behavioral inhibition in the context of negative emotion , decreasing ventromedial prefrontal and increasing extended amygdalar-ventral striatal activity correlated highly with measures of decreased constraint and increased negative emotion , respectively .

18054971|Because the amygdala is believed to be critically implicated in memory for emotionally arousing information and because it is part of the primary olfactory area , we hypothesized that patients with a unilateral medial temporal-lobe resection including the amygdala would not show enhanced memory for arousing compared to nonarousing odors .

18054970|The orbitofrontal cortex , together with the amygdala , is confirmed to represent the main center organizing both primary and secondary learned aspects of emotions .

18047598|Initially , rats were selectively bred for speed of amygdala kindling , and , in subsequent generations , were assessed in behavioral paradigms to measure activity , emotionality , impulsivity , and learning .

18049816|The amygdala has been implicated as a substrate for modulating memory for emotionally salient events ; yet no study to date has demonstrated that this area has a direct connection in the primate brain .

18049816|These projections offer anatomical data supporting the hypothesis that the RSC might receive emotionally salient input directly from the amygdala and suggest a role for the RSC as a node within a neural system potentially capable of integrating emotional information for use in memory or other cognitive processes .

18046310|The amygdala is a component of the limbic system that plays a central role in emotional behavior and certain psychiatric diseases .

18046310|The cellular mechanisms for emotional learning in the amygdala are believed to be the result of changes in synaptic transmission efficacy , similar to long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- .

18043766|In a previous study , we demonstrated that amygdala reactivity to masked negative facial emotions predicts negative judgmental bias in healthy subjects .

18039673|Serotonin plays a role in the regulation of emotional states in amygdala which in turn affect the function of hypothalamus .

18038126|Both hypermnesia and peri-emotional amnesia are amygdala-dependent and vary as a function of noradrenergic-glucocorticoid input to the amygdala during emotional episodic encoding .

18037022|Viewing emotional pictures resulted in increased amygdala activation compared to neutral pictures and this effect was enhanced in subjects with a high versus low cortisol level under placebo condition .

18037008|Adrenal stress hormones , amygdala activation , and memory for emotionally arousing experiences . .

18037005|Studying the way emotionality activates the amygdala and the functional impact of this activation we found that the amygdala modulates memory-related processes in other brain areas , such as the hippocampus .

18035523|Ictal EEG showed rhythmic theta waves originated from the right temporal lobe , and SISCOM showed ictal hyperperfusion on right insula , amygdala , hippocampal head , and anterior temporal lobe , whereas interictal FDG-PET showed interictal hypometabolism in the same brain regions , suggesting dysfunction and abnormal activation of right temporo-limbic structures related to an emotional response to music .

18035429|Neural correlates to both emotion and cognitive functions in the monkey amygdala . .

18035429|Recent lesion and non-invasive studies identify the medial temporal lobe , including the amygdala , not only with emotion but also with working memory in relation to the prefrontal cortex .

18035429|In the present study , amygdalar neuronal activity was recorded from monkeys during performance of discrimination tasks that led to presentation of emotion-related -LRB- rewarding or aversive -RRB- stimuli .

18030335|We conclude that , in observers naïve to art criticism , the sense of beauty is mediated by two non-mutually exclusive processes : one based on a joint activation of sets of cortical neurons , triggered by parameters intrinsic to the stimuli , and the insula -LRB- objective beauty -RRB- ; the other based on the activation of the amygdala , driven by one 's own emotional experiences -LRB- subjective beauty -RRB- .

18029095|Increased amygdala activation is related to heart rate during emotion processing in adolescent subjects . .

18028117|Two experiments using functional magnetic resonance imaging show that this signature correlates with brain activity in the amygdala and the hippocampus during the processing of musical stimuli with emotional valence .

18004139|We conducted a study with functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- in 13 healthy volunteers to test the dopaminergic modulation on amygdala response to emotional processing and to evaluate if it was the result of a direct action on amygdalar nuclei or indirect modulation via medial prefrontal cortex projecting on amygdala.A placebo-controlled crossover experimental design was used .

18004139|Amygdala activation was evaluated during a facial emotion recognition test.The statistical comparison between placebo versus levodopa situations revealed a significant reduction in activation of right amygdala during the levodopa fMRI session .

18002729|The results obtain for 65 healthy adults using nonlinear dynamics methods like fractal dimension confirm the key roles of the bilateral amygdala , bilateral hippocampus , BA9 -LRB- dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -RRB- , and BA45 -LRB- ventromedial prefrontal cortex -RRB- in modulating emotional response in healthy adults .

17993209|However , for emotional words , activation in the amygdala , hippocampus , and posterior parahippocampal cortex predicted item recognition only .

17990271|The amygdala controls emotional and social behavior and regulates instinctive reflexes such as defense and reproduction by way of descending projections to the hypothalamus and brainstem .

17990090|Because a functioning amygdala is critical for emotional modulation of the attentional blink , the findings support a role for the amygdala in the pathophysiology of AS .

17988930|The amygdala , reward and emotion . .

17988930|Recent research provides new insights into amygdala contributions to positive emotion and reward .

17988930|In addition , neuropsychological studies reveal that the amygdala is essential for only a fraction of what might be considered ` stimulus-reward processing ' , and that the neural substrates for emotion and reward are partially nonoverlapping .

17988930|Finally , evidence suggests that two systems within the amygdala , operating in parallel , enable reward-predicting cues to influence behavior ; one mediates a general , arousing effect of reward and the other links the sensory properties of reward to emotion .

17986682|This study compares amygdala and nucleus accumbens activation in children and adolescents at high and low risk for major depression under varying attentional and emotional conditions .

17978016|Imaging data lead to the hypothesis that antisocial , violent , and psychopathic behavior may in part be attributable to impairments in some of the brain structures -LRB- dorsal and ventral PFC , amygdala , and angular gyrus -RRB- subserving moral cognition and emotion .

17960136|Here we report that this tendency was related specifically to enhanced activation in the amygdala and in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex when imagining positive future events relative to negative ones , suggesting a key role for areas involved in monitoring emotional salience in mediating the optimism bias .

17959800|A ventral limbic stream via the uncinate fasciculus targets the temporal proisocortex and the amygdala , indicating an additional powerful influence over the emotional motivational sphere .

17959260|Low dose of D-cycloserine -LRB- DCS -RRB- , a partial agonist of glycine binding site on N-methyl-D-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- receptors , can facilitate extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 -LRB- ERK1/2 -RRB- activity in the amygdala and modulate emotional behavior .

17958709|We found that individuals with lesions to the amygdala , an area responsible for processing emotional responses , displayed impaired decision making when considering potential gains , but not when considering potential losses .

17958480|Nature , 395 , 597-600 , 1998 ; Whalen , P. J. , Rauch , S. L. , Etcoff , N. L. , McInerney , S. C. , Lee , M. B. , & Jenike , M. A. Masked presentations of emotional facial expressions modulate amygdala activity without explicit knowledge .

17956744|The human emotional brain without sleep -- a prefrontal amygdala disconnect . .

17950625|Dissociated responses in the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex to bottom-up and top-down components of emotional evaluation . .

17940084|Conversely , recent data suggest that conflict from emotional distracters may be resolved by an alternative route , wherein the rostral anterior cingulate cortex inhibits amygdalar responsiveness to task-irrelevant emotional stimuli .

17940084|The results revealed 2 distinct circuits : a lateral prefrontal '' cognitive control '' system that resolved nonemotional conflict and was associated with enhanced processing of task-relevant stimuli in sensory cortices , and a rostral anterior cingulate '' emotional control '' system that resolved emotional conflict and was associated with decreased amygdalar responses to emotional distracters .

17928582|The amygdala is a heterogeneous brain structure implicated in processing of emotions and storing the emotional aspects of memories .

17928582|In the medial amygdala , c-Fos appears to be evoked by emotional novelty of the experimental situation .

17928436|The AMPA receptor subunit glutamate receptor 1 -LRB- GluR1 or GluR-A -RRB- contributes to amygdala-dependent emotional learning .

17904218|As the amygdala formation has been implicated in generation of emotional states such as anxiety , we tested the effect of CCK on spontaneous synaptic events in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- using whole cell patch recordings in rat brain slice preparation .

17898336|Patients with any of the three disorders consistently showed greater activity than matched comparison subjects in the amygdala and insula , structures linked to negative emotional responses .

17898152|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is a major emotional center in the brain and regulates the expression of both learned fear and anxiety .

17888411|Reappraisal resulted in early -LRB- 0-4 .5 sec -RRB- prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- responses , decreased negative emotion experience , and decreased amygdala and insular responses .

17888411|Suppression produced late -LRB- 10.5-15 sec -RRB- PFC responses , decreased negative emotion behavior and experience , but increased amygdala and insular responses .

17884110|During anticipation of pictures with certain negative valence , activities of supracallosal anterior cingulate cortex , ventrolateral prefrontal cortex , insula , and amygdala were enhanced relative activity levels that for the uncertain emotional anticipation condition .

17884110|It is thought that the limbic system involving the amygdala , ACC , and insula , engaged emotional processes , and that the input system involving the visual cortex entered an idling state .

17872393|The orbitofrontal cortex is strongly connected with limbic areas of the medial temporal lobe that are critically involved in the establishment of declarative memories -LRB- entorhinal and perirhinal cortex and the hippocampal region -RRB- as well as the amygdala and the hypothalamus that are involved in emotional and motivational states .

17870614|Influence of attentional demands on the processing of emotional facial expressions in the amygdala . .

17870614|Thus , emotional processing of peripheral faces in the amygdala also appears to depend on the available perceptual attentional resources .

17870235|The amygdala is known to be critical for the enhancement of memory for emotional , especially negative , material .

17870235|Consistent with our hypothesis , we found that the hemispheric laterality of the amygdala involvement in successful memory for emotional material was influenced not only by the sex of the subjects , as previously proposed , but also by the sex of the faces being remembered .

17870235|These results confirm the existence of sex differences in amygdala lateralization in emotional memory but also demonstrate a subtle relationship between the observer and the stimulus in this process .

17853075|In contrast , REM sleep-rich late sleep was shown to improve in particular emotional memories involving amygdalar function , as well as procedural memories -LRB- for skills -RRB- not depending on hippocampal or amygdalar function .

17853075|Preventing the increase in cortisol during late REM sleep-rich sleep by administration of metyrapone impaired hippocampus-dependent declarative memory but enhanced amygdala-dependent emotional aspects of memory .

17846154|This chapter explores the way in which the amygdala and OFC contribute to emotion and reward processing in macaque monkeys , taking into account recent methodological and conceptual advances .

17846154|Contrary to the prevailing view , the amygdala and OFC make distinct contributions to emotional responses and reward processing .

17846152|It receives extensive sensory input and sends output to areas important for emotional processing and expression , including medial temporal cortical areas , hypothalamic and brain stem autonomic areas , and the amygdala .

17846152|The complex connections between the orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala , as well as other areas involved in emotion , suggest important implications for the role of the orbitofrontal cortex in anxiety disorders , in which emotional expression is not appropriate to the situation .

17825840|Frontolimbic dysfunction is observed in borderline personality disorder -LRB- BPD -RRB- , with responses to emotional stimuli that are exaggerated in the amygdala and impaired in the anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- .

17765205|These findings are consistent with impairments in neural systems subserving emotion and involving the amygdala in CD , regardless of age of onset .

17762508|Upon exposure to stressful stimuli , central endocannabinoid and cholinergic systems appear to be activated in key limbic areas such as hippocampus and amygdala , which might contribute to adaptive cognitive and emotional strategies to cope with aversive situations .

17728113|Impaired facial emotion recognition and reduced amygdalar volume in schizophrenia . .

17728113|Structural abnormalities of the amygdala and impaired facial emotion recognition have been reported in schizophrenia .

17728113|Most studies demonstrated reduced amygdalar volumes in schizophrenia patients , and difficulty in recognizing negative facial emotions has also been reported .

17728113|However , findings on the deficit in facial emotion recognition have been inconsistent , and the relationships between this impairment and amygdalar volume reduction remain unclear .

17728113|In this study , we investigated these relationships by performing volumetric analysis of the amygdala and evaluation of facial emotion recognition performance in the same subjects with schizophrenia .

17728113|This study demonstrated that amygdala dysfunction may contribute to impaired facial emotion recognition in schizophrenia .

17723029|The reviewed research suggests that the amygdala , in combination with the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex , plays an important role in the retrieval of memories for emotional events .

17715585|Subsequent recognition requires a set of structures , including amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex , that links perceptual representations of the face to the generation of knowledge about the emotion signaled , a complex set of mechanisms using multiple strategies .

17715358|The amygdala plays a central role in fear conditioning , emotional processing , and memory modulation .

17715358|fMRI analysis revealed significant amygdala activation during the emotion recognition task .

17715358|Our novel in vivo data highlight the central importance of the serotonergic system in the responsiveness of the human amygdala during emotional processing .

17715054|Prior work has shown that structural variants differentially affect function of the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- VMPFC -RRB- , regions important for the regulation and expression of emotion .

17712272|This study provides evidence for theta power changes in the amygdala and demonstrates that the analysis of brain oscillations provides a powerful tool to explore mechanisms implicated in emotional processing .

17709301|The task uses emotionally positive and affiliative stimuli to elicit responsivity in the amygdala-hippocampus region .

17698996|Posterior orbitofrontal areas are further distinguished by dense and distinct patterns of connections with the amygdala and memory-related anterior temporal lobe structures that may convey signals about emotional import and their memory .

17698177|This impairment in neural activity was evidenced in areas involved in wake-sleep cycle regulation -LRB- anterior hypothalamus and supraoptic nucleus -RRB- , but also in memory -LRB- frontal cortex and hippocampus -RRB- and emotions -LRB- amygdala -RRB- .

17698040|Consequent loss of amygdalar function may account for abnormalities in emotion processing typical of BD subjects .

17692344|We investigated the effect on rat anxiety behavior of local administration of THC in the prefrontal cortex , basolateral amygdala and ventral hippocampus , brain regions belonging to the emotional circuit and containing high levels of CB1 receptors .

17688985|Previous studies examining neural responses to emotional stimuli in individuals with major depressive disorder -LRB- MDD -RRB- have indicated increased responses within the left amygdala to sad faces , and increased activity within the visual cortex and striatum to expressions of happiness .

17688985|Our findings indicate that preferential decreases in the left amygdala in response to negative pictures might be involved in the processing of emotional stimuli in depressed individuals .

17681356|Recent research on affective processing has suggested that low spatial frequency information of fearful faces provide rapid emotional cues to the amygdala , whereas high spatial frequencies convey fine-grained information to the fusiform gyrus , regardless of emotional expression .

17672385|The somatic marker hypothesis posits a key role for the ventromedial prefrontal cortex , amygdala , and insula in the ability to utilize emotions to guide decision making and behavior .

17667888|Anatomic region-of-interest analyses showed that the placebo group exhibited amygdala activation and response habituation , while the DCS group displayed blunted amygdala responses to emotional faces across the experiment , whereby habituation was not detected .

17666080|Previous research has demonstrated that suppression of inhibition in projection neurons of the basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- represents an essential mechanism underlying the emergence of negative emotional responses , including exaggerated fear and anxiety .

17663596|The cognitive and emotional effects of amygdala or frontal cortex lesions were compared in rats trained to time both a 50-s visual signal paired with food and an embedded 10 - or 20-s auditory signal that was paired with either appetitive -LRB- food -RRB- or aversive -LRB- footshock -RRB- outcomes .

17650397|The subtraction of the results of emotion Stroop task and general word task showed the brain function area activation images as follows simple emotion factors activated the right amygdala , left parietal lobe , and bilateral prefrontal cortices and occipital lobes in the normal control group ; bilateral parietal lobes and left dorsal lateral frontal cortex in the AD group ; and bilateral prefrontal cortices in the dAD group ; With quite different brain activation pattern , the dAD patients are more susceptible to the influence of emotional factors than AD patients .

17643397|The orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- and amygdala are part of a circuit involved in the processing of emotions and associated physiological responses .

17641736|We have reviewed research on the effects of stress on LTP in the hippocampus , amygdala and prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- and present new findings which provide insight into how the attention and memory-related functions of these structures are influenced by strong emotionality .

17641736|An important feature of the model is the idea that endogenous mechanisms of plasticity in the hippocampus and amygdala are rapidly activated for a relatively short period of time by a strong emotional learning experience .

17641734|Brain regions such as the amygdala , hippocampus and cortex , which are directly involved in the regulation of emotional behavior , contain high densities of cannabinoid CB1 receptors .

17636562|Previous research showed that the processing of overt threat cues formed by evolutionary experience such as snake or angry face induced automatic increased responses of the emotion-related system consisting of the amygdala , the anterior cingulate , and the orbitofrontal cortex .

17635630|The posterior orbitofrontal cortex , anterior temporal sensory association areas and the amygdala have a key role in emotional processing and are robustly interconnected .

17635630|The amygdala innervates all layers of the posterior orbitofrontal cortex , including the middle , or feedforward , target layers , in a pathway that may convey information about emotional context .

17629579|Long term upregulation of CRF -LRB- 1 -RRB- receptors is observed in the amygdala following a history of dependence , and CRF antagonists selectively block emotionality , excessive alcohol drinking and stress-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking in post-dependent animals .

17629385|Recent data suggest that subthreshold presentation of emotional information is relayed to the amygdala along subcortical pathways .

17626877|We found evidence that emotional memories are suppressed via two time-differentiated neural mechanisms : -LRB- i -RRB- an initial suppression by the right inferior frontal gyrus over regions supporting sensory components of the memory representation -LRB- visual cortex , thalamus -RRB- , followed by -LRB- ii -RRB- right medial frontal gyrus control over regions supporting multimodal and emotional components of the memory representation -LRB- hippocampus , amygdala -RRB- , both of which are influenced by fronto-polar regions .

17626199|These findings are discussed in relation to the role of the amygdala in emotional learning and in cross-species comparisons of emotional behavior .

17617382|Oxytocin attenuates amygdala responses to emotional faces regardless of valence . .

17617382|Oxytocin reduced right-sided amygdala responses to all three face categories even when the emotional content of the presented face was not evaluated explicitly .

17610388|Such findings indicate that regulation of amygdala responses may aid in more accurate emotion processing .

17607567|The present investigation was conducted to examine the relationship between automatic amygdala responsivity to fearful faces which may be interpreted as an index of trait-like threat sensitivity and spatial processing characteristics of facial emotions .

17601709|We conclude that adults with BPD exhibit changes in fronto-limbic activity in the processing of fear stimuli , with exaggerated amygdala response and impaired emotion-modulation of ACC activity .

17598644|These experiments suggest that rapid neurotransmitters changes observed in the nucleus accumbens and amygdala , are possibly related to immobility and emotional states such as anxiety , aversion and/or depression caused by pain .

17597166|Inappropriate approach behavior is also characteristic of people with acquired amygdala damage and people with acquired frontal lobe impairment ; given this , the developmental disorder of social approach seen in WS and perhaps also DS might be due to poor emotion recognition -LRB- due to abnormal amygdala functioning -RRB- or poor control of behavior -LRB- due to frontal lobe abnormality -RRB- .

17588776|The amygdala activations associated with cognitive control correlated negatively with the reappraisal scores of an emotion regulation questionnaire .

17588776|The results indicate that cognitive control of particularly unpleasant emotions is associated with elevated prefrontal cortex activity that may serve to attenuate emotion processing in for instance amygdala , and , notably , in perception related brain areas .

17576282|The results indicated that affect labeling , relative to other forms of encoding , diminished the response of the amygdala and other limbic regions to negative emotional images .

17576282|These results suggest that affect labeling may diminish emotional reactivity along a pathway from RVLPFC to MPFC to the amygdala .

17574869|Both emotional stimulus categories resulted in activations in the extended occipital cortex , in the prefrontal cortex , and in the amygdala .

17574755|Regional gray matter volumes in a putative emotional brain circuitry comprised of the anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , amygdala and hippocampus were calculated using optimized voxel-based morphometry on high-resolution structural magnetic resonance images .

17574366|As the amygdala is involved in various aspects of emotional processing , its characterization using neuroimaging modalities , such as functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- , is of great interest .

17574366|The emotional stimulation paradigm resulted in robust bilateral amygdala activation for the approaches with 2-mm sections only -- but with larger activation volumes for a TE of 36 ms as compared with that of 27 ms. Moderate smoothing with a 4-mm spatial filter represented a good compromise between increased sensitivity and preserved specificity .

17570686|Instead , we found a valence-specific regulation effect : High cognitive effort was associated with reduced activity in emotion processing regions , i.e. the amygdala and ventral striatum .

17570684|The present imaging data clearly indicate that animals with no prior exposure to a threat-inducing emotional stimulus selectively activated the unconditional fear neuronal pathway , specifically with heightened amygdala and hypothalamic activation .

17568631|This may reflect the excision of a ` hyper-excitable ' amygdala which pre-operatively misinterprets fearful expressions as containing blends of other emotions .

17562698|In this critical review , we examine the feasibility of identifying biomarker of bipolar disorder by discussing existing findings regarding functional abnormalities in neural systems underlying emotion processing -LRB- amygdala centered -RRB- , working memory , and attention -LRB- dorsolateral prefrontal cortex centered -RRB- that persist through bipolar depression and remission and are bipolar specific rather than common to unipolar depression .

17561172|Bilateral amygdala lesions impair the ability to identify certain emotions , especially fear , from facial expressions , and neuroimaging studies have demonstrated differential amygdala activation as a function of the emotional expression of faces , even under conditions of subliminal presentation , and again especially for fear .

17561172|Yet the amygdala 's role in processing emotion from other classes of stimuli remains poorly understood .

17558282|Further , amygdala activation , independent of emotional valence , appears to be associated with memory enhancement .

17556011|These results challenge the common view that loss aversion engages a distinct emotion-related brain network -LRB- e.g. amygdala and insula -RRB- .

17553953|The amygdala and dopaminergic innervation thereunto are considered to cooperatively regulate emotional states and behaviors .

17553730|Recent neuroimaging studies of conditioned fear , attention to threat and interpretation of emotionally ambiguous stimuli indicate common amygdala-prefrontal circuitry underlying these processes , and suggest that the balance of activity within this circuitry is altered in anxiety , creating a bias towards threat-related responses .

17545449|To examine the structural abnormalities in the amygdala in stroke patients and see what contribution the amygdala may make to psychopathology and cognitive dysfunction related to stroke , because the amygdala has important roles in the processing of emotions , cognitive function , and psychiatric disorders .

17544223|Here , we studied the effects of a daily restricted presentation of highly palatable complete meal replacement , chocolate Ensure Plus -LRB- Ensure -RRB- in food-deprived -LRB- restricted feeding , RF -RRB- and free-fed -LRB- restricted treat , RT -RRB- rats , on the expression of the clock protein , Period2 -LRB- PER2 -RRB- in regions of the brain involved in motivational and emotional regulation ; these include the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNSTov -RRB- , the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CEA -RRB- , the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , the dentate gyrus -LRB- DG -RRB- and the dorsomedial hypothalamus -LRB- DMH -RRB- .

17544015|In women , the interaction between emotion and working memory yielded a significantly stronger response in the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- compared to their male counterparts .

17543896|These results show that emotional expressions can have an influence on memory beyond simple accuracy and that this effect is in part mediated by the amygdala , a region previously implicated in emotional perception and memory .

17542953|The blink reflex of acoustic startle reflex -LRB- ASR -RRB- is modulated by emotions and a loss of physiological aversive ASR potentiation is reported in humans following amygdala lesions .

17537966|In humans , functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that temporal unpredictably causes sustained neural activity in amygdala and anxiety-like behavior as quantified by enhanced attention toward emotional faces .

17537966|Our findings show that unpredictability per se is an important feature of the sensory environment influencing habituation of neuronal activity in amygdala and emotional behavior and indicate that regulation of amygdala habituation represents an evolutionary-conserved mechanism for adapting behavior in anticipation of temporally unpredictable events .

17519393|Beyond the mesolimbic DA system , increasing evidence points to the amygdala-prefrontal cortical circuit as an important processor of emotionally salient information and how neurodevelopmental perturbances within this circuitry may lead to dysregulation of DAergic modulation of emotional processing and learning along this cortical-subcortical emotional processing circuit .

17515109|In addition , the past sensory stimulation in the amygdala , regarded as the center of anxiety , and the reinforcement of emotional ties is pointed out as an important thing for anxiety formation .

17511282|The neuronal circuit , the so-called ` Yakovlev ' , is recognized as the neuronal connections between the orbitofrontal , temporal , amygdaloid , and thalamic regions , possibly relevant to emotional function .

17509899|We observed common fronto-limbic activations -LRB- including orbitofrontal cortical and amygdalar components -RRB- associated with the interaction of emotional stimulus processing and response suppression .

17504440|Reports , as reviewed here , suggest that two important regions of the limbic system , the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- , control different aspects of emotional behaviour .

17493834|fMRI results replicated previous findings on emotion regulation with regulation differences reflected in regions of PFC and the amygdala .

17488204|Cognitive regulation of emotional responses to aversive events engages prefrontal regions that modulate activity in emotion-processing regions such as the amygdala .

17488204|Regulation also modulated activity in the amygdala , a key emotion-processing region .

17488204|Regulation effects on amygdala activity were larger for positive than for negative stimuli , potentially reflecting a greater malleability of positive emotional reactions .

17488204|Increasing and decreasing positive and negative emotion can thus increase and decrease subjective reactions and associated amygdala activity in line with regulatory goals , and is associated with different patterns of prefrontal activation as a function of emotional valence and regulatory goal .

17481593|The 5-HTTLPR genotype alters resting brain function in emotion-related regions in healthy individuals , including the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex .

17478107|Areas processing emotions showed intense activation -LRB- ACC and bilateral insula , hippocampus and anterior temporal poles , bilateral amygdala -RRB- .

17476685|These results suggest that SERT binding in the amygdala , as well as the differential regulation of the SERT in amygdala and frontal cortex in alcoholics may help to explain the dysfunctional regulation of emotions in alcoholics .

17475514|Regulatory interactions with the amygdala are thought to be critical for emotional processing in the extended limbic system .

17469914|Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate changes in blood oxygen level-dependent signal within the amygdala and subgenual AC associated with trait neuroticism in a nonclinical sample of 36 volunteers during an emotional conflict task .

17469914|Neuroticism correlated positively with amygdala and subgenual AC activation during trials of high emotional conflict , compared with trials of low emotional conflict .

17466022|These results demonstrate that the cerebellum supports the memory processes even in the absence of a crucial site for emotions like the amygdala .

17466022|Finally , the inactivation of the perirhinal cortex never alters retrieved fear traces , showing important differences between the amygdala , cerebellum and perirhinal cortex in emotional memories .

17459428|We compared the visual scanning patterns and emotion judgments of individuals with autism , individuals with schizophrenia and controls on a task well characterized with respect to amygdala functioning .

17459428|Impairments in social orienting are discussed within the context of evidence suggesting the role of the amygdala in orienting to emotionally meaningful information .

17452054|While the structures belonging to the HPA axis react with a bigger neuronal activation and almost no change in the shape of dynamics curve in response to restraint , the structures involved in higher processing of emotional cues -LRB- amygdala and hippocampus -RRB- become deficiently activated with age despite their generally higher basal level of activation .

17448721|This study aims to examine the function of the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system , including the amygdala , in recognizing emotions in juvenile parkinsonism -LRB- JP -RRB- .

17445989|Furthermore , we propose the hypothesis that emotions processed by the amygdala enhance pain due to increased inhibition of the LC in peripheral neuropathy .

17443128|Together , these data in rats suggest that stress responsive AVP/V1b receptor systems -LRB- including the amygdala -RRB- may be critical components of the neural circuitry underlying the aversive emotional consequences of drug withdrawal , as well as the effect of negative emotional states on drug-seeking behavior .

17442833|A large body of pharmaco-behavioral data implicates the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- in the facilitation of memory consolidation by emotions .

17442593|Whereas there is ample evidence for a role of the amygdala in the processing of visual emotional stimuli , particularly those with negative value , discrepant results have been reported regarding amygdala responses to emotional auditory stimuli .

17442593|The present study used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate cerebral activity underlying processing of emotional nonlinguistic vocalizations , with a particular focus on neural changes in the amygdala .

17442593|Results revealed bilateral amygdala activation in response to all emotional vocalizations when compared to neutral stimuli .

17442593|These findings suggest that the generally accepted involvement of the amygdala in the perception of emotional visual stimuli , such as facial expressions , also applies to stimuli within the auditory modality .

17442593|Importantly , this amygdala response was observed for both positive and negative emotional vocalizations .

17435932|The ventral striatal-pallidal and the extended amygdala are then two basal forebrain macro-anatomical systems , that together with the basal nucleus of Meynert and with the septal-diagonal band system , constitute the main structures that are particularly connected with the limbic cortical areas , and that altogether project to the hypothalamus and to the brainstem which give rise to the autonomic , endocrine and somatosensory components of the emotional experiences , and that regulate the basic activities of drinking , eating , and related to the sexual behavior .

17428974|The role of the human amygdala in real social interactions remains essentially unknown , although studies in nonhuman primates and studies using photographs and video in humans have shown it to be critical for emotional processing and suggest its importance for social cognition .

17426483|Given the role of the basolateral amygdala in anxiety and the expression of alpha1 , alpha2 and alpha3 subunits in this region , we also assessed the effects of bilateral infusion of L838 ,417 and midazolam directly into basolateral amygdala in the conditioned emotional response test .

17425582|Recent evidence suggests that the amygdala central nucleus -LRB- CeA -RRB- and midbrain-striatal dopamine systems are critically involved in the alteration of attentional and emotional processing of initially neutral stimuli by associative learning .

17408704|So far , neuroimaging results have been inconsistent as to whether the amygdala is more active during explicit or incidental facial emotion processing .

17408704|Using high field functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- specifically optimized for ventral brain regions we show strong and robust amygdala activation for explicit and implicit processing of emotional facial expressions in 29 healthy subjects .

17408704|Bilateral amygdala activation was , however , significantly greater when subjects were asked to recognize the emotion -LRB- explicit condition -RRB- than when required to discern the age -LRB- implicit condition -RRB- .

17408704|A significant correlation between amygdala activation and emotion recognition , but not age discrimination performance , emphasizes the amygdala 's enhanced role during conscious emotion processing .

17406646|The amygdala is a key structure in a limbic circuit involved in the rapid and unconscious processing of facial emotions .

17406646|Recent studies reported that amygdala activity during conscious emotion processing is modulated by a functional polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene -LRB- 5-HTTLPR -RRB- in healthy subjects .

17406646|In the present study , amygdala reactivity to displays of emotional faces was measured by means of fMRI at 3T in 35 patients with major depression and 32 healthy controls .

17406646|Risk allele carriers -LRB- S or L -LRB- G -RRB- -RRB- demonstrated increased amygdala reactivity to masked emotional faces , which in turn was significantly correlated with life-time psychiatric hospitalization as an index of chronicity .

17400299|These systems include the ventral hippocampus , which is involved in context and focus on tasks , the amygdala , which mediates emotional behavior , and the prefrontal cortex , which modulates activity throughout the limbic system to enable behavioral flexibility .

17400196|Alterations of emotional processing concerned the amygdala-hippocampus and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex .

17398080|For controls , ` with-arousal ' responses were associated with emotion-specific activity for fear -LRB- amygdala -RRB- , disgust -LRB- insula -RRB- and anger -LRB- anterior cingulate -RRB- , together with common medial prefrontal cortex -LSB- MPFC -RSB- engagement , as predicted .

17395609|Using functional magnetic resonance imaging , we showed that simply combining music -LRB- rich in emotion but poor in information about the concrete world -RRB- with neutral films -LRB- poor in emotionality but rich in real-world details -RRB- yields increased activity in the amygdala , hippocampus , and lateral prefrontal regions .

17395609|The finding that the amygdala , the heart of the emotional brain , responds increasingly to an emotional stimulus when it is associated with realistic scenes supports a fundamental role for concrete real-world content in emotional processing .

17393440|Both pain conditions activated the pain matrix , but arthritic pain was associated with increased activity in the cingulate cortex , the thalamus , and the amygdala ; these areas are involved in the processing of fear , emotions , and in aversive conditioning .

17383999|However , the HR of the amygdala to negative emotional valence correlated with the amygdala MTR but not with the MTR in SN/VTA or the hippocampus .

17382578|The contributions of emotion and vividness have been linked to the amygdala and visual cortex respectively .

17379422|A few recent reports point to a peculiar disturbance of normal sexual dimorphism in brain regions implicated in the processing of emotions , including amygdala , orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate .

17379318|We assume that in major depressive disorder -LRB- MDD -RRB- , the abnormal self-focus may be related to altered neural activity in the ventral cortical midline structures -LRB- CMS -RRB- , the one-sided attribution of negative emotions to the self with neural activity in the amygdala and the ventral striatum/N .

17376972|Here we report that serotonin -LRB- 5-hydroxytryptamine ; 5-HT -RRB- , a modulatory neurotransmitter known to be linked to learned fearful and emotional behavior , has dual effects on excitatory synaptic transmission in the basolateral amygdala .

17376704|We examined amygdala response to evocative emotion faces in BI -LRB- N = 10 , mean 12.8 years -RRB- and BN -LRB- N = 17 , mean 12.5 years -RRB- adolescents while systematically manipulating attention .

17376704|Analyses focused on amygdala response during subjective ratings of internal fear -LRB- constrained attention -RRB- and passive viewing -LRB- unconstrained attention -RRB- during the presentation of emotion faces -LRB- Happy , Angry , Fearful , and Neutral -RRB- .

17376704|BI adolescents , relative to BN adolescents , showed exaggerated amygdala response during subjective fear ratings and deactivation during passive viewing , across all emotion faces .

17376605|The hypothesis is as follows : There is a basic circuit of emotion which runs from the hippocampus -LRB- defined as the dentate gyrus plus the CA regions -RRB- , where emotion arises , to the amygdala and from there to serotonergic pacemaker cells in the dorsal raphe nucleus -LRB- DRN -RRB- .

17376605|The hippocampus , the amygdala , and the DRN all project to the hypothalamus , which are branches off the basic loop that subserve the autonomic expression of emotion .

17375193|The human amygdala is thought to play a pivotal role in the processing of emotionally significant sensory information .

17367577|Notably , musical stimuli have been shown to activate specific pathways in several brain areas associated with emotional behaviours , such as the insular and cingulate cortex , hypothalamus , hippocampus , amygdala , and prefrontal cortex .

17359942|We observed the activation of the amygdala during the imagining of emotional facial affect versus the imagining of neutral facial affects .

17359942|In particular , given that the processing of information concerning the facial patterning of different emotions and the enactment of behavioral responses , such as autonomic arousal , are central components of the imagery of emotional facial expressions , we postulate the central role of the amygdala in the imagery of emotional facial expressions .

17354075|The following neural structures have been shown to be prominent in emotional function : right and left hemisphere , corpus callosum , anterior commissure , anterior cingulate , prefrontal cortex , amygdala , and insular cortex .

17354072|We hypothesise that a disproportional influence of the amygdala on other brain areas , such as the hippocampus , might underlie this specific emotional interference .

17354069|Altered experience of emotion following bilateral amygdala damage . .

17354069|It has been well established that the amygdala is critical for processing various aspects of emotion , and in particular , for the perception of negative emotions such as fear .

17354069|These findings have interesting parallels with recent animal work -LRB- cf. Bauman , Lavenex , Mason , Capitanio , & Amaral , 2004a -RRB- , and they provide valuable insights into the emotional life of an individual with complete bilateral amygdala damage .

17354068|Enhanced memory for novel or unexpected stimuli is mediated by anterior hippocampus , whereas increased memory for emotional stimuli is mediated by a beta-adrenergic-dependent modulation of amygdala-hippocampal interactions .

17351536|More specifically , this modulatory effect might reflect interactions between emotional and nociceptive systems in the prefrontal and cingulate cortices , ventral striatum , amygdala and hippocampal regions .

17347350|Arousal regulation , emotional flexibility , medial amygdala function , and the impact of early experience : comments on the paper of Lewis et al. .

17339967|Using functional neuroimaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- , we show that faces paired with emotional movies enhance BOLD responses in the bilateral temporal pole , anterior cingulate cortices , amygdala and bilateral superior temporal sulcus relative to identical faces juxtaposed with neutral movies .

17336945|Functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- was used to examine and compare amygdala responses in 12 young and elderly controls and in 12 mild AD patients during viewing of neutral and emotional human facial expressions .

17336945|However , the AD group had significantly greater amygdala responses to both neutral and emotional faces relative to elderly controls .

17336344|In response to negative facial emotions , CAH females activated the amygdala significantly more than healthy females , whereas CAH males did not differ from control males .

17335325|Prior imaging studies suggest that patients with major depressive disorder have abnormalities in frontal and limbic neural circuitry including the amygdala , which is relatively more activated at rest and in response to negative emotional stimuli -LRB- sadness , fear , etc. -RRB- in depressed patients than in controls .

17335325|Treatment reduced fMRI activation during emotional distracters in several regions including right orbital frontal cortex , left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex , right ventromedial prefrontal cortex , right anterior cingulate cortex , right inferior frontal cortex , right amygdala/parahippocampal area , right caudate , right fusiform gyrus , and left posterior cingulate .

17335325|Despite the limitations of a small sample size and the lack of a placebo control group , this study demonstrated that bupropion XL therapy for 8 weeks may attenuate emotion-induced , blood-oxygen-level-dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- activation responses in the amygdala and related brain regions .

17327215|While in the scanner , cued recall of the clinically repressed event was associated with regional brain activations characteristic of emotional arousal , including the amygdala and right inferior frontal lobe , when compared with an equally severe event from the patient 's past , as rated by the LEDS .

19331026|The impact of stimulus intensity level and AD-associated changes to the prefrontal cortex and amygdala on emotional Stroop effects requires further investigation .

17323220|Patients with epilepsy who undergo unilateral hippocampal and amygdala resection appear to have alterations in the reversion capacity with an emotional component that would explain the lack of behavior flexibility that they sometimes have and that are not related with either the isolated presence of executive alterations or low intellectual quotient .

17321555|At the neurobiological level , it is still debated to what extent abnormalities of the limbic system , in particular the amygdala , may be responsible for the emotional disturbances characterising ASD .

17321555|On the basis of these results and the existing literature we suggest that ASD may be characterised by atypicalities in the integration of physiological and cognitive aspects of emotional experiences which we argue arise because of poor connectivity between the amygdala and functionally associated cortical areas .

17320060|Based on these observations , we suggest that the medial amygdaloid nucleus provides substantial input to the DR and may contribute an emotional influence on sleep-wakefulness cycle or pain-stress modulation .

17320057|However , no in vivo study assessed the serotonin -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- - releasing system in the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- and amygdala -- the crucial regions regulating emotion .

17314300|Projections from the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- input from the ventral tegmental area -LRB- VTA -RRB- converge in the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- , forming a neural circuit implicated in certain cognitive and emotional processes .

17299753|Interestingly , huntingtin aggregates were especially well accumulated in two interacting limbic forebrain systems , the ventral striatopallidum and the extended amygdala , which may contribute to the early onset of emotional changes observed in the tgHD rat .

17295979|The role of the amygdala in facial emotional expression during a discrimination task . .

17289273|These regions included -LRB- 1 -RRB- sites associated with thermoregulation such as the median preoptic nucleus , dorsomedial hypothalamus and raphe pallidus , -LRB- 2 -RRB- the supraoptic nucleus , a region important for osmoregulation and a key mediator of oxytocin and vasopressin release , -LRB- 3 -RRB- the medial and central nuclei of the amygdala , important in the regulation of social and emotional behaviors , and -LRB- 4 -RRB- the shell of the nucleus accumbens and -LRB- anterior -RRB- ventral tegmental area , regions associated with the reinforcing effects of MDMA .

17284168|Risk allele carriers for either gene showed significantly increased bilateral amygdala activation in response to emotional stimuli , implicating an additive effect of both genotypes .

17280522|In contrast , the activity in the amygdala specifically predicts the successful encoding of emotional compared with neutral pictures .

17280517|The main effect of deceiving the interrogator showed activations of the ventromedial prefrontal -LRB- medial orbitofrontal -RRB- cortex and amygdala , adding new evidence that the brain regions assumed to be responsible for emotional processing or social interaction are active during deceptive behavior similar to that in real-life situations .

17275189|Recent evidence suggests that ALLO 's anxiolytic effects appear to be mediated by the amygdala , a key neural structure for emotional and cognitive behaviors .

17270156|The action of valproate on these signalling pathways has not been studied yet in limbic areas such as the nucleus accumbens and the amygdala which are central for the regulation of emotional behaviors .

17267796|Increased amygdala and insula activation during emotion processing in anxiety-prone subjects . .

17267796|Increased amygdala reactivity during processing of certain types of emotional stimuli -LRB- e.g. , fear , anger -RRB- has been observed in patients with anxiety disorders such as social phobia and posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- .

17267796|Subjects participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- during an emotion face assessment task that has been shown to reliably engage amygdala and associated limbic structures .

17267796|Anxiety-prone subjects had significantly greater bilateral amygdala and insula activation to emotional faces than did the anxiety-normative comparison subjects .

17267796|Increased amygdala and insula reactivity to certain types of emotional processing is seen in young adults with increased anxiety-related temperamental traits .

17255010|For example , the amygdala attaches emotional value to faces , enabling us to recognize expressions such as fear and trustworthiness , while the posterior superior temporal sulcus predicts the end point of the complex trajectories created when agents act upon the world .

17239513|The OFC , through extensive and complex interconnections with several brain structures with putative role in pathophysiology of schizophrenia including amygdala , hippocampus , thalamus , DLPFC , and superior temporal lobe , may mediate schizophrenia symptoms such as blunting of emotional affect and impaired social functioning .

17234587|The amygdala is a temporal lobe structure that is required for processing emotional information .

17234587|Polymodal sensory information enters the amygdala at the level of the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and undergoes local processing , after which the behavioral and autonomic responses that accompany emotions are initiated .

17224096|These changes are amygdala dependent and vary as a function of emotional arousal and valence .

17224096|To determine whether there is amygdala hyper-responsiveness to emotional stimuli as the underlying pathological substrate of cognitive dysfunction in BPD , 16 unmedicated female patients with BPD were tested on the behavioural indices of emotion-induced amnesia and hypermnesia established in 16 healthy controls .

17224096|These findings suggest that an amygdala hyper-responsiveness to negative stimuli may serve as a crucial aetiological contributor to emotion-induced cognitive dysfunction in BPD .

17215388|The central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- plays a critical role in positive emotional responses that involve stimulus-reward learning and are induced by the reinforcing effects of many drugs of abuse , including alcohol .

17210136|Converging evidence from animal and human lesion studies implicates the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- in emotional regulation and aggressive behavior .

17202427|Extensive evidence indicates that the basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- mediates hormonal and neurotransmitter effects on the consolidation of emotionally influenced memory and that such modulatory influences involve noradrenergic activation of the BLA .

17201461|These results indicate that amygdala activity may specifically reflect the expression of learned fear responses and support the position that this region plays a central role in the expression of emotional reactions .

19544622|Considerable evidence suggests that the human amygdala plays an important role in higher cognitive functions in addition to its well-known role in emotional processing .

19544622|Results are discussed in terms of their relevance to current theories of amygdala function that can integrate its cognitive and emotional functions in a comprehensive framework .

17192439|Extracellular hippocampal acetylcholine level controls amygdala function and promotes adaptive conditioned emotional response . .

17192439|Hence , these findings highlight that hippocampal cholinergic neurotransmission controls amygdala function , thereby leading to the selection of relevant emotional information .

17190969|Moreover , emotional faces increased the coupling between the FG and the amygdala , whereas famous faces increased the coupling between the FG and the orbitofrontal cortex .

17188251|Time-varying amygdala response to emotional faces in generalized social phobia . .

17188251|Individuals with social phobia -LRB- SP -RRB- have altered behavioral and neural responses to emotional faces and are hypothesized to have deficits in inhibiting emotion-related amygdala responses .

17188251|We tested for such amygdala deficits to emotional faces in a sample of individuals with SP .

17188251|Commonly reported SP deficits in habituation might reflect neural regions associated with emotional self-evaluations rather than the amygdala .

17185795|Centrally administered NPS increased Fos-like immunoreactivity -LRB- FLI -RRB- in the paraventricular , dorsomedial nuclei and lateral hypothalamic area -LRB- LHA -RRB- of the hypothalamus , the midline thalamic nuclei , and the amygdala , many parts of which are involved in the regulation of emotion , arousal , and feeding .

17184978|We found a clear enhanced activity of the frontal lobe , temporal cortex , insula , cingulate , and amygdala -LRB- mainly right side -RRB- in patients when hearing emotional words in comparison with controls .

17182913|Responses of single neurons in monkey amygdala to facial and vocal emotions . .

17182913|We recorded neuronal activity in the amygdala of monkeys while watching nine video clips of species-specific emotional expressions : three monkeys showing three emotional expressions -LRB- aggressive threat , scream , and coo -RRB- .

17182913|Of the 227 amygdala neurons tested , 116 neurons -LRB- 51 % -RRB- responded to at least one of the emotional expressions .

17182913|These neurons were found in the central nucleus of the amygdala , the nucleus that receives inputs from other amygdala nuclei and in turn sends outputs to other emotion-related brain areas .

17182226|The amygdala is a key structure in a limbic circuit involved in the rapid and unconscious processing of facial emotions .

17182226|In the present study , the role of the amygdala in automatic , involuntary appraisal processes , which are believed to be a crucial component of emotion processing , was investigated in 23 healthy subjects .

17182226|Significant correlations were found between amygdala responses to masked negative facial expressions and negative evaluation shifts elicited by the corresponding emotion quality in the affective priming task .

17182226|Spontaneous amygdala reactivity to facial emotions appears to be a determinant of automatic negative evaluative response tendencies .

17176492|In both patient groups , we observed overrepresentation of T allele carriers of a functional polymorphism in the upstream regulatory region of TPH2 -LRB- SNP G-703T , rs4570625 -RRB- which was previously shown to bias responsiveness of the amygdala , a structure critically involved in emotionality .

17156385|The sex difference in the emotional response to stress suggests a sex-specific stress response in the amygdala .

17156379|The amygdala appears to be important for experience-dependent learning by emotional arousal , and cholinergic muscarinic influences are essential for the amygdala-mediated modulation of memory .

17156152|As both are episodic disorders of affect regulation , the common pathophysiological mechanism is likely to involve deficits in amygdala-mediated , plasticity-dependent emotional conditioning .

17151272|Recent data from our laboratory have demonstrated that appetitive drug memories undergo protein synthesis-dependent reconsolidation in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , an area important in the formation of emotional memories .

17146016|Attempts to link pathological features of the amygdala , which plays a key role in emotional processing , to autism have shown little consensus .

17146016|In study 1 , individuals with autism who had small amygdalae were slowest to distinguish emotional from neutral expressions -LRB- P = .02 -RRB- and showed least fixation of eye regions -LRB- P = .04 -RRB- .

17140740|Spatial orientation learning and reversal learning require complex integration of spatial information and response selection involving the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex , whereas cued fear conditioning is an associative type of emotional memory that highly depends on amygdala function .

17134484|2 -RRB- Motivation and emotion are processed by the basal ganglia ; motivation by the striatum and related structures , emotion by limbic basal ganglia : the amygdala and related structures .

17133391|Several neuroimaging studies of emotion regulation found the amygdala to be a target for downregulation and prefrontal regions to be associated with downregulation .

17133391|To characterize the role of prefrontal regions in bidirectional emotion regulation and to investigate regulatory influences on amygdala activity and peripheral physiological measures , a functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- study with simultaneous recording of self-report , startle eyeblink , and skin conductance responses was carried out .

17131586|Across these experiments we found : i -RRB- behaviorally a strong emotional word effect in the left visual field -LRB- right hemisphere - RH -RRB- of normals , correlating well with the emotional word performance of aphasic patients , pointing to a specific role of the right hemisphere ; ii -RRB- electro-physiologically a specific early -LRB- 100-140 msec -RRB- brain response to emotional words during scalp recordings in healthy subjects subsequent to right visual field -LRB- left hemisphere - LH -RRB- stimulation , that source localization procedures project to posterior areas of the right hemisphere ; iii -RRB- preliminary data of a very early -LRB- 60 msec -RRB- activation of the left amygdala in a depth-recorded epileptic patient when the same emotional words were presented to the right visual field -LRB- left hemisphere -RRB- ; and iv -RRB- a consistent gender difference showing that the above findings might be relevant for men only .

17131586|We propose that the left amygdala via extrastriate connections acts as a detector of emotional word content at a very early stage of processing ; that this amygdala response subsequently modulates the cortical response to emotional words asymmetrically , rendering the left visual cortex less sensitive to emotional words than that of the right hemisphere ; and that this modulation is gender dependent .

17131200|The amygdala integrates and coordinates emotional and autonomic responses .

17126910|Although numerous neural structures have been identified to be involved in emotional face processing , the amygdala is thought to be a core moderator .

17126910|While previous studies have relied on facial images of humans , the present study is concerned with the effect of computer-generated -LRB- avatar -RRB- emotional faces on amygdala activation .

17126910|Robust amygdala activation was apparent in response to both human and avatar emotional faces , but the response was significantly stronger to human faces in face-sensitive structures , i.e. fusiform gyri .

17126369|The biological basis of this emotional memory effect has been studied in lesion and neuro-imaging studies and depends upon an interaction between the amygdala and medial temporal lobe memory systems including the hippocampus .

17126369|This study sought to investigate whether patients with schizophrenia had performance deficits on emotional memory tasks consistent with abnormal amygdala function .

17126037|Sequence of information processing for emotions based on the anatomic dialogue between prefrontal cortex and amygdala . .

17126037|These findings indicate that the connections between prefrontal cortices and the amygdala follow similar patterns as corticocortical connections , and by analogy suggest pathways underlying the sequence of information processing for emotions .

17118928|A major focus of interest is the role of efferent and afferent connectivity between the amygdala and the neocortical brain regions , now believed to be critical for the processing of social and emotional perceptions .

17118928|The emotional responsiveness of the amygdala , and its associated circuits , to social threat is also influenced by functional polymorphisms in the promoter of the serotonin transporter gene .

17118408|Previous studies suggest that the magnocellular pathway , a visual processing system that rapidly provides low spatial frequency information to fast-responding structures such as the amygdala , is more involved in the processing of emotional facial expressions than the parvocellular pathway -LRB- which conveys all spatial frequencies -RRB- .

17113931|Recognizing personally familiar faces is the result of a spatially distributed process that involves visual perceptual areas and areas that play a role in other cognitive and social functions , such as the anterior paracingulate cortex , the precuneus and the amygdala -LSB- M.I.

17102701|Noradrenergic beta-blockade suppressed the encoding of emotionally arousing unpleasant stimuli and reduced amygdala activation in healthy volunteers , with potential implications for posttraumatic stress disorder .

17101871|Human brain imaging studies have shown that greater amygdala activation to emotional relative to neutral events leads to enhanced episodic memory .

17100784|Analyses revealed mPFC activation to all social groups except extreme -LRB- low-low -RRB- out-groups , who especially activated insula and amygdala , a pattern consistent with disgust , the emotion predicted by the SCM .

17100539|On the basis of research linking psychopathy , amygdala dysfunction , and deficits in facial affect recognition , the authors predicted that psychopathic offenders would display performance deficits when required to identify the emotional expression of particular faces .

17099887|Finally , the prominent amygdala projection to the face region of M3 may significantly influence the outcome of higher-order facial expressions associated with social communication and emotional constructs such as fear , anger , happiness , and sadness .

17097275|Using functional magnetic resonance imaging , we measured amygdala reactivity to faces varying on emotional intensity in subjects with generalized social phobia -LRB- GSP -RRB- and matched healthy controls , and observed greater bilateral activation to high -LRB- vs. low -RRB- intensity expressions in the phobic group , suggesting that more arousing social-emotional cues contribute to limbic hyperactivity in GSP .

17095520|Based on recent findings of amygdalar abnormalities in Parkinson 's disease , we hypothesized that non-demented patients with this illness would show blunted reactivity during aversive/unpleasant events , as indexed by diminished emotional modulation of the startle eyeblink response .

17088049|For instance , activations in the paracingulate gyrus are almost systematically associated with theory of mind tasks , while the amygdala is mainly involved in emotion perception tasks .

17088019|Stronger transient activation was also observed to male expression of pain -LRB- Vs neutral and anger -RRB- in high-order visual areas -LRB- STS and fusiform face area -RRB- and in emotion-related areas including the amygdala -LRB- highest peak t-value = 10.8 -RRB- , perigenual anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , and SI .

17086141|The roles of amygdala , insula and prefrontal cortex located at crossroads between perceptive analysis and emotional conceptual knowledge are particularly underlined .

17084617|These processes of regulation of emotion trigger activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and inhibition of the amygdala .

17083920|The pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus projects to important limbic nuclei including the amygdala and cingulate cortex , is involved in the processing of stimuli with emotional content , and contains an abundance of SERT .

17079169|There is also extensive evidence that the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- modulates the consolidation of emotional arousing training experiences via interactions with other brain regions .

17074446|The amygdala is important for the formation of emotions that are affected by olfactory information .

17069470|We hypothesize that the amygdala plays a key role in giving humor an emotional dimension .

17067740|Overall brain activity for spontaneous pain of PHN involved affective and sensory-discriminative areas : thalamus , primary and secondary somatosensory , insula and anterior cingulate cortices , as well as areas involved in emotion , hedonics , reward , and punishment : ventral striatum , amygdala , orbital frontal cortex , and ventral tegmental area .

17062371|In particular , the amygdala is a region that is known to play a prominent role in the expression of emotions , and this function is believed to be disrupted in affective disorders and drug abuse .

17058525|Posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- patients experience symptoms which implicate dysfunction of emotional memory circuits , and possible damage of the amygdala .

17048126|The amygdala , a temporal lobe structure that is part of the limbic system , has long been recognized for its central role in emotions and emotional behavior .

17047934|Furthermore , lorazepam - and scopolamine-induced memory impairment for both gist -LRB- which is amygdala dependent -RRB- and detail raises the possibility that their effects on emotional memory do not depend only on the amygdala .

17045847|Because the amygdala is involved in both epilepsy and emotion , common neural mechanisms in this temporal lobe structure may underlie the emotional disturbances observed in people with epilepsy .

17027931|Major depressive disorder is characterized by increased and sustained emotional reactivity , which has been linked to sustained amygdala activity .

17027931|This study explored relationships between amygdala and DLPFC activity during emotional and cognitive information processing in unipolar depression .

17027931|Relative to control subjects , depressed subjects displayed sustained amygdala reactivity on the emotional tasks and decreased DLPFC activity on the digit-sorting task .

17027866|By studying two rare patients with congenital lipoid proteinosis -LRB- Urbach-Wiethe -RRB- and a focal disease emphasis on the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , we demonstrate that this bidirectional modification of episodic encoding by emotion depends on the integrity of the amygdala , as both retrograde and anterograde modulatory effects are absent .

17021168|The human amygdala has classically been viewed as a brain structure primarily related to emotions and dissociated from higher cognition .

17021168|These results support models of amygdala function that can account for its involvement not only in emotion but also higher cognition .

17019406|A stronger mood lowering effect was associated with less accurate performance on faces expressing a negative emotion in the incidental task and a stronger right amygdala response to fearful faces in comparison to happy faces .

17019406|These results were explained in terms of a mood-induced bias leading to a stronger impact of the expressed negative emotion which subsequently leads to more interference in the incidental task and a stronger amygdala response .

17015096|It is suggested that dysfunctions in the frontal cortex , especially the orbitofrontal cortex , the cingulate cortex and the amygdala are associated with the emotional and cognitive impairments .

17015084|Moreover , implicit processing of affective intonation seems to be bound to subcortical regions mediating automatic induction of specific emotional reactions such as activation of the amygdala in response to fearful stimuli .

17015072|This review will focus on a motivational circuit in the brain , centered on the amygdala , that underlies human emotion .

17014255|However , in circumstances when emotional arousal may be high -LRB- i.e. , during exposure to aversive periorbital shock -RRB- , other structures -LRB- such as amygdala -RRB- may be activated to permit learning even in the absence of input from mPFC .

17010993|Furthermore , we found a negative correlation of ventral amygdala activation in the patients with reappraisal scores comprising the ability to limit emotional responding by re-interpreting emotion-eliciting situations .

17001274|The study yielded two main findings : -LRB- i -RRB- processing of emotional distracters was associated with enhanced functional coupling between the amygdala and the inferior frontal cortex and -LRB- ii -RRB- the inferior frontal cortex showed a left-lateralized activation pattern discriminating successful from unsuccessful trials in the presence of emotional distraction .

16997382|Recent advances in the functioning of the limbic system and the application of Geschwind 's concept of disconnection in the cortico-limbic networks , pointed the role of the amygdala and its connections with medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex , the same structures that are strictly interlinked with the neurobiology of emotions and affective disorders .

16996221|We show here that the hcrt/orx peptides can also exert a strong action on the amygdala , a structure known for its implication in emotional aspects of behavior .

16996221|These results suggest that the hcrt/orx system can act through the amygdala to augment arousal and evoke the autonomic and behavioral responses associated with fear , stress or emotion .

16989896|Chronic modulation of GABA -LRB- A -RRB- receptor function by benzodiazepines or neuroactive steroids also affects Y -LRB- 1 -RRB- R expression in the amygdala , suggesting that a functional interaction between the GABA -LRB- A -RRB- receptor and Y -LRB- 1 -RRB- R mediated signalling may contribute to the regulation of emotional behaviour .

16982430|Resolving emotional conflict : a role for the rostral anterior cingulate cortex in modulating activity in the amygdala . .

16982430|Using functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- , we find that activity in the amygdala and dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices reflects the amount of emotional conflict .

16982430|These data suggest that emotional conflict is resolved through top-down inhibition of amygdalar activity by the rostral cingulate cortex .

16979422|Repeated stress in animal models causes brain regions involved in memory and emotions , such as hippocampus , amygdala , and prefrontal cortex , to undergo structural remodeling with the result that memory is impaired and anxiety and aggression are increased .

16973732|These observations indicated that the carbohydrates synthesized by Fut9 play critical roles in functional regulations of interneurons in the amygdalar subdivisions and suggested a role for the Le -LRB- x -RRB- structure in some aspects of emotional behavior in mice .

16970965|The use of tempo and mode cues in distinguishing happy from sad music was also spared in S.M. Thus , the amygdala appears to be necessary for emotional processing of music rather than the perceptual processing itself .

16964249|By enhancing the processing of sensory cues , the BLA-mediated facilitation of rhinal interactions may explain how the amygdala promotes memory formation in emotional conditions .

16963565|The effect of anticipation and the specificity of sex differences for amygdala and hippocampus function in emotional memory . .

16963565|Key brain areas involved in emotional memory are the amygdala and hippocampus , which are also recruited during aversion and its anticipation .

16963565|Results support an established animal model elucidating the functional neuroanatomy of the amygdala and hippocampus in emotional memory , highlight the importance of anticipatory processes in such memory for aversive events , and extend neuroanatomical evidence of sex differences for emotional memory .

16959817|Such unpleasant musical experiences have been shown to activate a network of brain structures involved in emotion , mostly located in the medial temporal lobe : the parahippocampal gyrus , amygdala , hippocampus and temporal pole .

16952466|Thus , facial emotions signaling a potential threat , e.g. , fear or anger , should be perceived rapidly and automatically , possibly through a subcortical processing route which includes the amygdala .

16950223|This vulnerability can manifest as mood-congruent memory during sad mood and may involve amygdala response , which is implicated in memory for emotionally arousing stimuli .

16943547|The functional role of the human amygdala in the evaluation of emotional facial expressions is unclear .

16943547|Thus , amygdala response to facial expressions could reflect the processing of primary reinforcement or emotional learning .

16943547|Here , using functional magnetic resonance imaging , we tested the hypothesis that amygdala response to facial expressions is driven by emotional association learning .

16932145|No task effect was observed in the amygdala , whereas lateral occipital complex and superior temporal complex showed left lateralized selectivity to the emotional task .

16932145|These results suggest that the amygdala is more sensitive to stimulus than explicit task parameters when processing emotion .

16931547|The amygdala complex , the limbic structure important for emotional memory formation , receives cholinergic innervation from the basal forebrain .

16922878|The right -LRB- nondominant -RRB- amygdala is crucial for processing facial emotion recognition -LRB- FER -RRB- .

16909002|A key structure of emotional processing is the amygdala .

16908199|fMRI was used to dissociate neural responses temporally associated with the subjective experience of emotion from those associated with the perception of emotion-inducing stimuli in order to better define the emotion-related functions of the amygdala , lateral orbital frontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- , and hippocampus .

16908199|Subjective emotion -LRB- present both during and after aversive pictures -RRB- was temporally associated with activation in the right lateral OFC and left hippocampus but not the amygdala .

16908199|The results support direct amygdala involvement in emotion perception but suggest that amygdala activation is not temporally associated with subjective emotion that occurs after the offset of emotion-related stimuli .

16904199|Subsequently , we searched for age-related changes in the volume and cell numbers in the amygdala or in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis , but failed to detect gross structural changes in these two brain areas , both implicated in emotionality .

16895832|The amygdala plays a critical role in generating the emotion of fear , and alterations in amygdala fear processing are thought to underlie the acquisition and maintenance of anxiety disorders .

16893305|Nonhuman primate studies , using selective amygdala lesions that spare cortical areas and fibers of passage , have helped to clarify the amygdala 's specific contribution to social and emotional behavior .

16893305|This variability in behavioral changes after selective amygdala lesions underscores the significant interplay between timing of the lesion , genetic traits , and environmental factors and suggests that the amygdala is not the generator of specific emotional responses , but acts as a modulator to ensure that emotional responses are appropriate to the external stimuli and social context .

16891579|Of particular relevance are the onset and duration of effects of stressors on brain areas subserving emotional memories , such as the amygdala , prefrontal cortex , and hippocampus .

16891565|Functional neuroimaging findings suggest specific roles for subregions of the medial prefrontal -LRB- mPFC -RRB- , orbito frontal -LRB- OFC -RRB- , anterior cingulate -LRB- ACC -RRB- , and insular cortices as well as the sublenticular extended amygdala -LRB- SLEA -RRB- and hippocampus in various components of emotional processing .

16888142|We found that the framing effect was specifically associated with amygdala activity , suggesting a key role for an emotional system in mediating decision biases .

16884932|Confrontation with arousing emotional pictures , accompanied by increased noradrenaline levels , evoked increased amygdala activation under placebo but not under betablocker condition .

16884932|When subjects were watching emotional stimuli , presumably associated with enhanced noradrenaline -LRB- NA -RRB- levels , amygdala activation was contrasted between the two cortisol groups .

16884932|We hypothesized that emotional stimuli would elicit more amygdala activation in the High than in the Low cortisol group .

16880223|Very few studies in humans have quantified the effect obtained after direct electrical stimulation of the amygdala , in terms of both emotional and physiological responses .

16880223|We assessed the effects of direct electric stimulations in either the right or the left amygdala on verbally self-reported emotions -LRB- Izard scale -RRB- and on psychophysiological markers of emotions by recording skin conductance responses -LRB- SCRs -RRB- and by measuring the electromyographic responses of the corrugator supercilii -LRB- EMGc -RRB- .

16880223|According to responses on Izard scales , electrical stimulations of the right amygdala induced negative emotions , especially fear and sadness .

16880223|In contrast , stimulations of the left amygdala were able to induce either pleasant -LRB- happiness -RRB- or unpleasant -LRB- fear , anxiety , sadness -RRB- emotions .

16880223|These findings provide direct in vivo evidence that the human amygdala is involved in emotional experiences and strengthen the hypothesis of a functional asymmetry of the amygdala for valence and arousal processing .

16879790|The need to critically examine the role of the amygdala in BI and trait anxiety , as well as to consider other brain areas that appear to be involved in subserving these emotional traits , is emphasized .

16878403|During performance of an emotional task , reactivity to unpleasant visual stimuli was positively correlated with the number of met158 alleles in the amygdala , as well as in other limbic and paralimbic nodes .

16869228|Recently , functional neuroimaging has provided dramatic illustrations of how a promoter polymorphism in the human serotonin transporter gene , which has been weakly related to several dimensions of emotional behaviors -LRB- such as neuroticism and anxiety traits -RRB- , is strongly related to the engagement of neural systems -- namely , the amygdala and subgenual prefrontal cortex , subserving emotional information processing .

16859420|A process-specific functional dissociation of the amygdala in emotional memory . .

16859420|Converging evidence highlights the important role of the amygdala in the enhanced memory for emotional material .

16859420|Critically , a direct comparison between both stages revealed that whereas the right amygdala was involved in emotional memory formation , the retrieval of those memories relied on the left amygdala .

16859420|Thus , this study demonstrates a hemispheric dissociation of amygdala involvement in different stages of emotional memory in humans .

16859412|Medial temporal lobe structures such as the hippocampus have been shown to play a critical role in mnemonic processes , with additional recruitment of the amygdala when memories contain emotional content .

16859412|Thus far , studies that have examined the relationship between amygdala activity and memory have typically relied on emotional content of the kind that is rarely encountered in day-to-day interactions .

16859412|The present event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study investigates whether amygdala activity supports emotional memory during the more subtle social interactions that punctuate everyday life .

16859412|Whereas a region within the right hippocampus responded strongly to all faces that had been paired with a description , regardless of its valence , activity in the right amygdala was uniquely sensitive to faces that had been previously associated with emotional descriptions -LRB- negative and positive > neutral -RRB- .

16859412|This pattern of activity in the amygdala was preserved even when the emotional contexts associated with faces could not be explicitly retrieved , suggesting a role for the amygdala in providing a nonspecific arousal indicator in response to viewing individuals with emotionally colored pasts .

16856165|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is critical for the generation of emotional behavior and the formation of emotional memory .

16855099|Less is known on the functional meaning of their strong connections to the amygdala , a key substrate for emotion .

16855030|We discuss results in relation to differences between young and older adults on emotion-recognition tasks ; we also discuss sociocognitive and neuropsychological -LRB- e.g. , amygdala -RRB- theories of aging .

16854439|Here we review haemodynamic and electrical neuroimaging results indicating that activity in the face-selective fusiform cortex may be enhanced by emotional -LRB- fearful -RRB- expressions , without explicit voluntary control , and presumably through direct feedback connections from the amygdala .

16854439|fMRI studies show that these increased responses in fusiform cortex to fearful faces are abolished by amygdala damage in the ipsilateral hemisphere , despite preserved effects of voluntary attention on fusiform ; whereas emotional increases can still arise despite deficits in attention or awareness following parietal damage , and appear relatively unaffected by pharmacological increases in cholinergic stimulation .

16854439|In the temporal domain , evoked-potentials show a widespread time-course of emotional face perception , with some increases in the amplitude of responses recorded over both occipital and frontal regions for fearful relative to neutral faces -LRB- as well as in the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex , when using intracranial recordings -RRB- , but with different latencies post-stimulus onset .

16837666|The ventral hippocampus -LRB- VH -RRB- may have an important role in spatial memory processes and emotional behaviors through connections with the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- and amygdala .

16837589|The interaction between emotion and memory showed significant responses in a set of areas , including the amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus .

16837589|Moreover , a psychophysiological interaction showed that amygdalar responses were more tightly related to those of the locus ceruleus when remembering faces that had been encoded in an emotional , rather than neutral , context .

16837173|It was speculated that ECT affected both the prefrontal cortex , commonly assumed to be involved in depression , and the amygdala , known to play a central role in the processing of emotional stimuli , through the limbic-cortical-striatal-pallidal-thalamic circuit .

16836634|Short latency responses may be important in priming the auditory cortex to prepare it for rapid analysis and in recruiting the amygdala for rapid emotional responses such as fear .

16824690|These pathologies include auditory sensory gating deficits in hippocampus , abnormal emotional coding in amygdala , pattern completion in thalamic and cortical areas , and disturbed fronto-limbic balance .

16820980|More recently it has been demonstrated that emotional stressors increase SP efflux in specific limbic structures such as amygdala and septum and that the magnitude of this effect depends on the severity of the stressor .

16815618|The amygdala has a role in the modulation of moods and emotion , processes that are known to be affected in people with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and depression .

16806315|These results imply that when heuristics use is discouraged on tasks utilizing subtle emotion transitions , deficits in the perception of anger and anger/fear blends , as well as fear , are evident with bilateral amygdala damage .

16802879|This article describes a neural model , called the Imbalanced Spectrally Timed Adaptive Resonance Theory -LRB- iSTART -RRB- model , that proposes how cognitive , emotional , timing , and motor processes that involve brain regions such as the prefrontal and temporal cortex , amygdala , hippocampus , and cerebellum may interact to create and perpetuate autistic symptoms .

16802879|The iSTART model shows how autistic behavioral symptoms may arise from prescribed breakdowns in these brain processes , notably a combination of underaroused emotional depression in the amygdala and related affective brain regions , learning of hyperspecific recognition categories in the temporal and prefrontal cortices , and breakdowns of adaptively timed attentional and motor circuits in the hippocampal system and cerebellum .

16801378|Prior studies reported that functional variants of both the serotonin transporter -LRB- 5-HTT -RRB- and tryptophan hydroxylase-2 genes -LRB- TPH2 -RRB- , 2 key regulators of the serotonergic signaling pathway , modulate amygdala activation during emotional processing .

16797614|Given the early onset of the emotion-specific effects reviewed here , it is likely that this system is activated in parallel with the ongoing evaluation of emotional content in the amygdala and related subcortical brain circuits .

16797609|These invariant representations are ideally suited to provide the inputs to brain regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala that learn the reinforcement associations of an individual 's face , for then the learning , and the appropriate social and emotional responses , generalise to other views of the same face .

16797609|These neurons thus provide important additional inputs to parts of the brain such as the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala that are involved in social communication and emotional behaviour .

16797608|The amygdala and the insula , structures that are involved in the representation of emotion , also are part of the distributed network of areas that are modulated by familiarity , reflecting the role of emotion in face recognition .

16783129|Although healthy older adults show the normal amygdala-modulated criterion shift for emotional items-influencing their subjective feeling that information has been previously encountered , the amygdala pathology present in early AD may disrupt this influence .

16782207|Thus , chronic hyperarousal in PD may diminish attentional resources and emotional response reflected in reduced ACC and amygdala activation .

16779555|Based on recent evidence that V1b receptors are located within the amygdaloid complex , a structure which is well known for its modulatory role of emotional processes , the possible involvement of the different amygdaloid nuclei in the anxiolytic - and/or antidepressant-like effects of SSR149415 was examined .

16775133|Cannabinoids Potentiate Emotional Learning Plasticity in Neurons of the Medial Prefrontal Cortex through Basolateral Amygdala Inputs . .

16775133|We report that systemic activation or blockade of cannabinoid CB1 receptors modulates emotional associative learning and memory formation in a subpopulation of neurons in the mammalian medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- that receives functional input from the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

16765649|Recognition of emotion with temporal lobe epilepsy and asymmetrical amygdala damage . .

16765649|Impairments in emotion recognition occur when there is bilateral damage to the amygdala .

16765649|In this study , ability to recognize auditory and visual expressions of emotion was investigated in people with asymmetrical amygdala damage -LRB- AAD -RRB- and temporal lobe epilepsy -LRB- TLE -RRB- .

16753928|Recent studies provide evidence that the amygdala , a structure important in stress - and emotion-related behaviors , plays a necessary role in the emergence of stress-associated changes in hippocampal LTP and memory .

16750614|The amygdala , prefrontal cortex , and striatum form a network of reciprocal connections that show topographically distinct patterns of activity as a correlate of up and down regulation processes during an emotional episode .

16740316|Abnormal size of the amygdala predicts impaired emotional memory in major depressive disorder . .

16740316|A relationship between emotional memory deficits and structural abnormalities of amygdala and hippocampus in MDD has been proposed but not shown , yet .

16730755|Expressive gestures involved additional areas related to social perception -LRB- bilateral STS , temporal poles , medial prefrontal lobe -RRB- , emotional processing -LRB- bilateral amygdala , bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- VLPFC -RRB- , speech and language processing -LRB- Broca 's and Wernicke 's areas -RRB- and the pre-supplementary motor area -LRB- pre-SMA -RRB- .

16725209|This finding has been taken as evidence of a '' negative emotion specific deficit '' , putatively associated with a dysfunction in the limbic system , particularly the amygdala .

16704749|The activation of both , the amygdala and prefrontal areas , might reflect an increased effortful but insufficient attempt to control intensive emotions during the recall of unresolved life events in patients with BPD .

16696847|The implication is that during exposure therapy the focus of attention must be fully directed towards the emotional content of the threatening situation to facilitate prefrontal control over the amygdala and that new contextual information , of emotional salience , must be added to create inhibitory projections from the hippocampus .

16686646|The lateral nucleus of the amygdala is critical for fear conditioning , a paradigm of emotional learning , which requires recognition of an unconditioned stimulus as aversive and association of conditioned stimuli with an unconditioned stimulus .

16686646|Some patients with temporal lobe epilepsy have amygdaloid damage associated with impaired emotional learning .

16648880|Moreover , social , but not mechanical , interpretations elicited activity in regions implicated in the perception and modulation of emotion -LRB- right amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex -RRB- .

16647271|We suggest that this is because the semantic representation of high-frequency emotional words may receive sufficient additional augmentation via the reciprocal activation from the amygdala such that selective augmentation by inferior frontal cortex to achieve lexical decision is unnecessary .

16639185|These findings are in agreement with several neurological and psychological studies suggesting that hyper-reactivity in the amygdala corresponds to a constellation of symptoms of anxiety in posttraumatic stress disorder , while the lowered activation of the prefrontal and the anterior cingular cortex could reflect slower extinction of a conditioned emotional response .

16632206|Early neonatal and postweaning social emotional deprivation interferes with the maturation of serotonergic and tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive afferent fiber systems in the rodent nucleus accumbens , hippocampus and amygdala . .

16632206|The impact of early emotional experience on the development of serotonergic and dopaminergic fiber innervation of the nucleus accumbens , hippocampal formation and the amygdala was quantitatively investigated in the precocious rodent Octodon degus .

16624961|Because regions of PFC and the amygdala are known to influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis , here we test whether PFC and amygdala responses during emotion regulation predict the diurnal pattern of salivary cortisol secretion .

16624961|We also test whether PFC and amygdala regions are engaged during emotion regulation in older -LRB- 62 - to 64-year-old -RRB- rather than younger individuals .

16624666|Evidence has demonstrated that the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is particularly associated with defensive behavior that involves the emotional states of fear and anxiety .

16624323|In addition , the amygdala revealed significantly severer Lewy pathology and neuronal loss than the primary and secondary visual pathways , suggesting that the degeneration of the amygdala , which receives the afferent connections from the substantia nigra , fails to modulate the visual processing according to cognition and emotion .

16612176|Compared with healthy controls , individuals with major depressive disorder show increased neural activity in response to sad faces and diminished neural activity in response to happy faces in emotion-related brain circuits -LRB- e.g. amygdala and ventral striatum -RRB- .

16611726|Here we report the finding that endogenous noradrenergic activation of the basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- induced by emotional arousal is essential in enabling glucocorticoid memory enhancement .

16602058|Other structures intervening in the various relevant processes in decision making are the amygdala -LRB- processing and encoding of the emotional signal and its association with contextual stimuli -RRB- and the cingulate cortex -LRB- process monitoring and response inhibition , especially in situations of uncertainty -RRB- .

16602055|Temporal lobe and amygdala are structures that participate in emotional processing .

16600519|These findings indicate that a subpopulation of serotonergic and nonserotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus cells may act to co-modulate processing in the vestibular nuclei and the central amygdaloid nucleus , regions implicated in the generation of emotional and affective responses to real and perceived motion .

16597795|Basically , these studies showed involvement of limbic and paralimbic cerebral structures -LRB- such as amygdala , hippocampus , parahippocampal gyrus , temporal poles , insula , ventral striatum , orbitofronal , as well as cingulate cortex -RRB- during the processing of music with emotional valence -LRB- such as pleasant or unpleasant -RRB- .

16597795|Recent studies suggest that music-syntactically irregular chords elicit changes in electrodermal activity , and that such chords activate orbital frontolateral cortex , as well as the amygdala -LRB- that is , brain structures that have been implicated in emotion processing -RRB- .

16595858|The low-expressing allele of the 5-HTT promoter polymorphism -LRB- HTTLPR -RRB- is associated with anxiety and with greater amygdala and other regional responses to emotional .

16585452|Participants whose sustained reactivity to emotional stimuli was low in the subgenual cingulate cortex -LRB- Brodmann 's area 25 -RRB- and high in the amygdala displayed the strongest improvement with CBT .

16575552|Additional increases were observed in the left amygdala/parahippocampal gyrus , a structure also involved in emotional arousal .

16569698|We show that the low expression variant , associated with increased risk of violent behavior , predicted pronounced limbic volume reductions and hyperresponsive amygdala during emotional arousal , with diminished reactivity of regulatory prefrontal regions , compared with the high expression allele .

16566949|In 17 adult individuals with Asperger syndrome -LRB- AS -RRB- and 17 well-matched controls we therefore assessed associations between MRI-derived amygdala volume and behavioral variables of emotion recognition and social cognition , as well as with core AS symptomatology .

16566949|Results revealed that individuals with AS exhibited impairments in emotion recognition and social cognition compared to controls and also showed atypical relationships between amygdala volumes and overall head size .

16566949|We found positive associations between emotional and social understanding and amygdala volume in the control group , but not in the AS group .

16566949|Our data seem to indicate that in AS the amygdala is not crucially involved in social and emotional understanding .

16566004|The hippocampal formation and amygdala are responsible for regulating emotion , learning , and behavior .

16550543|Functional imaging studies have also demonstrated activation of primitive emotional centers such as ventral striatum , midbrain , amygdala , orbitofrontal cortex , and ventral medial prefrontal cortex in listeners of moving musical passages .

16546144|The amygdala has been implicated in emotional arousal and in the regulation of sleep .

16541088|The amygdala plays an important role in emotional conditioning and its experimental extinction .

16540253|The right ventromedial region is critical for the emotional tagging of moral situations , the orbitofrontal cortex responds to social cues and mitigates impulsive reactions , and the amygdalae are necessary for threat detection and moral learning .

16523242|Results suggest that the social deficit in autism may derive in part from a failure in evaluating the emotional significance of emotional faces , a function for which the amygdala plays an important role .

16510734|Moreover , it has been unclear whether amygdala activity at encoding corresponds with enhanced memory for all contextual aspects of the presentation of an emotional item , or whether amygdala activity primarily enhances memory for the emotional item itself .

16510224|It has been argued that critical functions of the human amygdala are to modulate the moment-to-moment vigilance level and to enhance the processing and the consolidation of memories of emotionally arousing material .

16497832|Between-subject transfer of emotional information evokes specific pattern of amygdala activation . .

16497832|The amygdala plays a crucial role in the processing of emotions .

16497832|In this study , we describe an experimental rat model of between-subject transfer of emotional information and its effects on activation of the amygdala .

16497832|Thus , in this study , we have shown that undefined emotional information transferred by a cohabitant rat can be evaluated and measured and that it evokes very strong and information-specific activation of the amygdala .

16492400|The amygdala is implicated in emotional processing , and its rich subcortical connections have led to suggestions that processing of emotional stimuli occurs independently of attention .

16492400|Using a novel attentional manipulation in conjunction with fMRI , we showed that emotion-related amygdala activity was modulated by attention , but that the degree of such modulation correlated with the personality variable harm avoidance , associated with trait anxiety .

16492400|In response to irrelevant emotional distractors , low harm-avoidant participants had relatively little emotion-related amygdala activity regardless of whether they maintained a specific or nonspecific attentional set .

16492400|High harm-avoidant participants , however , showed strong emotion-related amygdala activity when maintaining a nonspecific attentional set and lower amygdala activity when maintaining a specific attentional set .

16490411|Recent advances in functional brain imaging have identified critical neural circuits involving the amygdala and other limbic structures , prefrontal cortical regions , thalamus , and basal ganglia that modulate emotional behavior and are disturbed in primary and secondary mood disorders .

16488545|The amygdala plays a key role in emotional processing and anxiety-related physiological and behavioral responses .

16487156|The involvement of GABA -LRB- A -RRB- receptors in fear extinction in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala is of particular interest , because of the role of these areas in emotional processes , and the role of the GABA -LRB- A -RRB- receptors in anxiety states .

16481440|Presentation of emotional distracters during the delay interval evoked strong activity in typical emotional processing regions -LRB- amygdala and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -RRB- while simultaneously evoking relative deactivation of the WM regions and impairing WM performance .

16476670|Task and content modulate amygdala-hippocampal connectivity in emotional retrieval . .

16476670|We show that retrieval of emotionally valenced contextual information is associated with enhanced connectivity from hippocampus to amygdala , structures crucially involved with encoding of emotional events .

16476670|When retrieval of emotional information is relevant to current behavior , amygdala-hippocampal connectivity increases bidirectionally , under modulatory influences from orbitofrontal cortex , a region implicated in representation of affective value and behavioral guidance .

16466794|Brain imaging studies show reduced activity in the medial prefrontal and limbic -LRB- amygdala -RRB- brain regions required to process emotional faces in schizophrenia , but suggest more localized loss of activity in these regions in ADHD .

16466794|As amygdala activity in particular has been linked to effective visual scanning of face stimuli , it is postulated that condition-specific breakdowns in these brain regions that subserve emotional behavior might manifest as distinct scanpath aberrations to facial expressions of emotion in schizophrenia and ADHD .

16465484|Linkage of neuron spike activity in the right and left amygdala in food motivation and emotional tension . .

16465484|Cross-correlation histograms were plotted to study the linkage of spike activity in simultaneously recorded neurons in the central nucleus of the right and left amygdala in rabbits in calm waking , after 24 hours of food deprivation , in satiation , and in emotional tension -LRB- on presentation of dogs -RRB- .

16461862|Consistent with current functional neuroanatomic models , patients with PTSD exhibited altered neural responses in the amygdala and ventral MPFC during the processing of emotionally salient but trauma-unrelated stimuli , potentially reflecting disorder-specific changes .

16460697|Participants completed an assessment of RF and participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- investigation that examined 1 -RRB- amygdala reactivity to observation of fearful/angry faces ; 2 -RRB- amygdala and right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- RVLPFC -RRB- reactivity to labeling emotions displayed in these faces ; and 3 -RRB- the relation between RVLPFC and amygdala activity during the labeling task .

16460697|Offspring from nonrisky families showed expected amygdala reactivity to observing fearful/angry faces and expected activation of RVLPFC while labeling the emotions , which was significantly negatively correlated -LRB- -.44 -RRB- with amygdala activation .

16460697|Offspring from risky families showed little amygdala activation during the observation task and a strong positive correlation -LRB- +.66 -RRB- between RVLPFC and amygdala activation in the labeling task , suggesting a possible dysregulation in the neural systems involved in responses to emotional stimuli .

16460693|The amygdala is believed to play a key role in processing emotionally salient , threat-relevant , events that require further online processing by cortical regions .

16460693|Emotional disorders such as depression and anxiety have been associated with hyperactivity of the amygdala , but it is unknown whether antidepressant treatment directly affects amygdala responses to emotionally significant information .

16458860|Besides increased activation in brain areas known to be involved in auditory as well as in neutral and emotional visual-auditory integration processes , the combined condition showed increased activation in many structures known to be involved in emotion processing -LRB- including for example amygdala , hippocampus , parahippocampus , insula , striatum , medial ventral frontal cortex , cerebellum , fusiform gyrus -RRB- .

16446410|This paper discusses the use of beta-adrenergic antagonists to prevent or erase non-conscious pathological emotional memories in the amygdala .

16445993|These results indicate that reactivation processes engage a down-regulation of ERK , possibly related to increases in glucocorticoids , in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex already known to be involved in emotional retrieval .

16442081|Moreover , the 5-HTTLPR affects the development of a broader corticolimbic circuit and alters the functional integration of emotional information between the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex .

16432299|The amygdala is widely recognized as a brain center critical for basic forms of emotional learning -LRB- e.g. , fear conditioning -RRB- and its structure in amphibians could suggest how this capacity evolved .

16432299|These presumably homologous regions apparently are capable of modulating the phylogenetically older central amygdala and allow more complex forms of emotional learning .

16423737|These results are consistent with theories invoking differential effects of stress on brain systems responsible for encoding and retrieving emotional memories -LRB- the amygdala -RRB- and non-emotional memories -LRB- e.g. , the hippocampal formation -RRB- , and inconsistent with the view that memories formed under high levels of stress are qualitatively the same as those formed under ordinary emotional circumstances .

16414028|The amygdala , a key emotional processing center , has functional abnormalities in mood disorders , which resolve following successful SSRI treatment .

16411179|In the fMRI experiment , this shift in rating of facial expressions in presence of a fearfully spoken sentence was correlated with the hemodynamic response in the left amygdala extending into the periamygdaloid cortex , which suggests that crossmodal effects on cognitive judgments of emotional information are mediated via these neuronal structures .

16411179|Presumably , these increased extrastriate activations correspond to enhanced alertness , whereas responses within the left amygdala modulate cognitive evaluation of emotional facial expressions .

16409669|The medial amygdala controls the coital access of female rats : a possible involvement of emotional responsiveness . .

16409669|The seemingly incompatible results of partner preference and paced mating tests can be compromised if the male is inherently aversive to the female ; this emotional response can be removed by the medial amygdala lesion .

16408764|-LSB- Involvement of amygdala in the emotional processing of pain -RSB- . .

16408764|Pain has a strong emotional component , and the amygdala plays a major role in emotional behaviours .

16407774|These systems included a number of regions typically associated with processing emotions in adults , namely the amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus , insula and cingulate gyrus , as well as the fusiform and superior temporal gyri .

16399218|Activation of the amygdala to emotionally valenced stimuli , and particularly to fearful faces , has been widely demonstrated in healthy young adults .

16399218|However , recent studies assessing amygdala responses to fearful emotional faces in the normal elderly have not shown similar results .

16399218|The reason for this is uncertain , but it may relate to life-span developmental changes in processing emotional stimuli or structural alterations in the amygdala with aging .

16380826|Evoked activity in the hypothalamus and amygdala of the cat in conditions of food-related motivation and emotional tension . .

16380826|The amplitude-time characteristics of potentials evoked by clicks were analyzed in bilateral leads from the lateral hypothalamus and amygdala in cats in conditions of food-related motivation , emotional tension -LRB- presentation of dogs -RRB- , and orientational reactions .

16374802|The generation of emotional responses by the basolateral amygdala is determined largely by the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to its principal neurons , the pyramidal cells .

16371950|The amygdala is a brain structure that directly mediates aspects of emotional learning and facilitates memory operations in other regions , including the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex .

16368249|Across subjects , the left amygdala was activated by each face condition separately , and its response was not selective for any particular emotion category .

16368249|These results challenge the notion that the amygdala has a specialized role in processing certain emotions and suggest that the amygdala may have a more general-purpose function in processing salient information from faces .

16361941|Impacts of facial identity and type of emotion on responses of amygdala neurons . .

16361941|The amygdala has been implicated in the processing of emotional expressions .

16361941|How amygdala neurons are affected by facial identity and type of emotion , however , has not yet been systematically examined .

16361941|We examined the activity of amygdala neurons using nine monkey stimuli : 3 monkeys x 3 types of emotion .

16361941|These results indicate that both facial identity and type of emotion have strong impacts on amygdala functions .

16358593|In mood regulation as well as in the perception and emotional dimension of pain stimuli , such brain structures as the amygdala , anterior cingulate cortex and prefrontal cortex are of main significance .

16352388|Strange feelings : do amygdala abnormalities dysregulate the emotional brain in schizophrenia ? .

16352388|Furthermore , studies of schizophrenia patients using structural MRI have demonstrated volume reductions of the amygdala , a key structure of the emotional brain .

16352388|Finally , functional fMRI studies have revealed an attenuated response of the amygdala to emotional stimuli as compared to neutral stimuli .

16352388|Specifically , a lesion to the amygdala in combination with reduced interconnectivity with the prefrontal cortex is hypothesized to give rise to reduced emotional expression -LRB- affective flattening -RRB- and emotion recognition deficits .

16351838|Cellular processes in the amygdala : gates to emotional memory ? .

16351838|The amygdala is considered a core structure of the so-called limbic system and has been implicated in a variety of functions , including emotional interpretation of sensory information , emotional arousal , emotional memory , fear and anxiety , and related clinical disorders .

16340378|During the placebo situation , the region-of-interest -LRB- ROI -RRB- analysis showed that emotional processing activated the bilateral amygdala .

16340378|The statistical comparison between the 2 situations -LRB- emotional vs control condition -RRB- revealed a highly significant reduction in activation of the bilateral amygdala for the levodopa fMRI session -LRB- P corrected < 0.0001 in the left and P = 0.002 in the right amygdala -RRB- .

16340378|These results suggest that administration of levodopa to healthy volunteers directly or indirectly impairs the amygdalar activation during the emotional perception task .

16326115|Recent neuroimaging studies have established a sex-related hemispheric lateralization of amygdala involvement in memory for emotionally arousing material .

16326115|Here , we examine the possibility that sex-related differences in amygdala involvement in memory for emotional material develop from differential patterns of amygdala functional connectivity evident in the resting brain .

16324692|Given the role of amygdalar endocannabinoids in the regulation of emotionality , this suggests that the ability of glucocorticoids to influence affective behavior may involve interactions with regulation of endocannabinoid content .

16319307|The amygdala is critical for connecting emotional reactions with environmental events .

16318588|This review explores insights into the relations between emotion and cognition that have resulted from studies of the human amygdala .

16317710|Time course analysis of raw data suggests that this augmented activation was not preceded by baseline increases in MPFC and amygdala during the period of emotional expectancy .

16316476|This exploratory study suggests a role of the functional -1019 C/G 5-HT1A and 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms on prefrontal cortex and amygdala activation patterns in response to emotional facial stimuli .

16310958|Such critical interactions between glucocorticoids and noradrenergic activation of the basolateral amygdala have important consequences for the role of emotional arousal in enabling glucocorticoid effects on these different memory functions .

16291945|A key player in emotionality and affective disorders , the amygdala has been implicated in the well documented , but mechanistically unexplained , relationship between pain and affect .

16291807|Abnormalities of both memory and emotion have been reported in patients with unilateral damage to the anteromedial temporal lobe , probably reflecting the functions of the amygdala and hippocampus in these processes .

16289871|The amygdala plays a crucial role in providing both direct and indirect top-down signals on sensory pathways , which can influence the representation of emotional events , especially when related to threat .

16289402|The presence of high levels of Ca -LRB- v -RRB- 1.2 immunoreactivity in BLC pyramidal cells is consistent with physiological findings showing that calcium entry through L-type calcium channels in pyramidal cell dendrites in the lateral amygdala is required for associative LTP and the conversion of synaptic events into long-term emotional memory .

16275018|These regions were not significantly activated by emotional picture perception which recruited a different neuronal network , including the amygdala , insula , medial and lateral prefrontal cortex , cerebellum , and occipitotemporal areas .

16271484|The present fMRI study examined effective connectivity within an emotional network composed of three brain areas : Amygdala -LRB- AMY -RRB- , Anterior Cingulate Cortex -LRB- AAC -RRB- and Orbito-Frontal -LRB- OFC -RRB- in processing fearful faces .

16256956|The primary aim of this study was to examine the association between response to emotionally harsh faces in the amygdala , a region implicated in social and threat-related processing , and severity of social anxiety symptoms in patients with generalized social phobia -LRB- GSP -RRB- .

16255003|The ventromedial prefrontal cortex , especially the '' medial prefrontal network , '' is connected to the amygdala , hypothalamus , and PAG , and allows cortical control over the system in relation to a wider set of emotions .

16249909|Abnormal amygdala and frontocortical responses to emotional stimuli are implicated in bipolar disorder -LRB- BD -RRB- and have been proposed as potential treatment targets .

16249909|The aim of this study was to investigate amygdala and frontocortical responses to emotional face stimuli in BD and the influences of mood-stabilizing medications on these responses .

16249909|Although the sample sizes were small , these preliminary results suggest that BD is associated with increased amygdala and decreased rAC response to emotional faces .

16249909|The findings also provide preliminary evidence that mood-stabilizing medications may reverse abnormalities in BD in the response of an amygdala-frontal neural system to emotional stimuli .

16249098|Passive viewing of both picture types elicited similar activations in areas related to the processing of social and emotional content , including MPFC and amygdala .

16245070|Here , we used functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- to demonstrate that a potentially functional variant of TPH2 modulates amygdala responsiveness to emotional stimuli of both negative and positive valence .

16242399|Contributions of the amygdala to emotion processing : from animal models to human behavior . .

16242399|Research on the neural systems underlying emotion in animal models over the past two decades has implicated the amygdala in fear and other emotional processes .

16242399|Here , we review research on the role of the amygdala in emotional processes in both animal models and humans .

16242399|The review is not exhaustive , but it highlights five major research topics that illustrate parallel roles for the amygdala in humans and other animals , including implicit emotional learning and memory , emotional modulation of memory , emotional influences on attention and perception , emotion and social behavior , and emotion inhibition and regulation .

16239763|In reviewing the literature , the amygdala emerges as a brain structure critical for emotional processing .

16239763|In addition , the amygdala 's response to emotional tasks is likely to be altered by the administration of both agonist and antagonist dopaminergic drugs .

16239030|The amygdala is considered a structure/process linking subjective experiences , emotional learning , brain development and stress physiology .

16236523|The amygdala is implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia through its function in the processing of emotions .

16205774|The opposing effects of bulbectomy and imipramine treatment in the hippocampus and amygdala demonstrate that these structures of the limbic system , both integrated in emotional processing , react quite differently with regard to neuroplasticity .

16204201|An interaction between emotional encoding context and accuracy of source memory revealed that successful retrieval of emotional context was associated with activity in left amygdala , and a left frontotemporal network including anterior insula , prefrontal cortex and cingulate .

16204201|In contrast , when contextual retrieval was unsuccessful , items encoded in emotional contexts elicited enhanced activity in right amygdala and a right-lateralized network that included extrastriate visual areas .

16204201|These findings indicate distinct effects of emotion on successful and unsuccessful retrieval of source information , including lateralization of amygdala responses .

16203979|The dosage of the neuroD2 transcription factor regulates amygdala development and emotional learning . .

16203979|The amygdala is centrally involved in formation of emotional memory and response to fear or risk .

16200206|The amygdala is believed to play a key role in assigning emotional significance to specific sensory input , and conditions such as anxiety , autism , stress , and phobias are thought to be linked to its abnormal function .

16199845|This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate amygdala response in patients with acute posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- to emotional expressions .

16197893|-LSB- Amygdala recording of emotions evoked by subliminal words -RSB- . .

16197694|Differential effects of lesions of the amygdala and prefrontal cortex on recognizing facial expressions of complex emotions . .

16197694|The results also suggest that the amygdala has a role in processing a wide range of emotional expressions .

16197502|The amygdala has also been implicated in certain forms of emotional learning and memory .

16193841|Presenile dementia mimicking Pick 's disease : an autopsy case of localized amygdala degeneration with character change and emotional disorder . .

16193841|This case indicates that localized amygdala degeneration can cause presenile dementia , and that character changes and emotional disorders are predominant over memory disturbance and/or disorientation .

16192380|This implies that the amygdala codes neither intensity nor valence per se , but a combination that we suggest reflects the overall emotional value of a stimulus .

16190788|Anxiety disorders in adults involve aberrant processing of emotional information that is hypothesized to reflect perturbations in the amygdala .

16188284|The lateral amygdala plays an important role in emotional learning .

16183121|Thus defined , the limbic lobe contains all of the major cortical -LRB- e.g. orbitofrontal , cingulate and insular cortices in addition to the hippocampal formation -RRB- and cortical-like -LRB- laterobasal-cortical amygdala -RRB- structures known to be especially important for emotional and motivational functions .

16181741|In lateral amygdala , glucocorticoid receptors are thus also localized to non-nuclear-membrane translocation sites , particularly dendritic spines , where they show an affinity for postsynaptic membrane densities , and may have a specialized role in modulating synaptic transmission plasticity related to fear and emotional memory .

16179807|We investigated the effect of E2 on CREB expression and phosphorylation and BDNF expression in the amygdala and hippocampus , areas involved in emotional processing .

16176889|This study examined whether patients with temporal lobe epilepsy -LRB- TLE -RRB- and ictal fear -LRB- IF -RRB- show emotion recognition deficits similar to those associated with amygdala damage .

16168629|Given that some brain regions involved in emotion processing , such as amygdala and connected structures , are selectively tuned to LSF visual inputs , these data suggest that ERP effects of emotional facial expression do not directly reflect activity in these regions .

16168033|These interact with the limbic regions , especially the amygdala , in relation to history of reward and emotional valence relating to a choice , and the basal ganglia for behavioural execution .

16162935|Comparison of the effects of bilateral orbital prefrontal cortex lesions and amygdala lesions on emotional responses in rhesus monkeys . .

16162935|Monkeys with PFo lesions , like those with amygdala lesions , displayed blunted emotional responses to the fake snake .

16155058|These negative findings are discussed in relation to -LRB- 1 -RRB- previous data showing specific impairment in autism in recognizing the belief-based expression of surprise , -LRB- 2 -RRB- previous data showing specific impairment in autism in recognizing fear , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- the convergence of findings that individuals with autism , like patients with amygdala damage , pass a basic emotions recognition test but fail to recognize more complex stimuli involving the perception of faces or part of faces .

16144602|In particular , the hippocampal pallium is implicated in spatial memory and temporal attribute processing , whereas the amygdalar pallium is involved in emotional memory .

16144602|Here we analyze the involvement of teleost fish lateral and medial pallia , proposed as homologous to the hippocampus and amygdala , respectively , in a variety of learning and memory tasks , such as spatial memory ; reversal learning ; delay or trace motor classical conditioning ; heart rate , emotional classical conditioning ; and two way active avoidance conditioning .

16144602|The reviewed evidence suggest that these two separate memory systems , the hippocampus-dependent spatial , relational or temporal memory system , and the amygdala based emotional memory system , could have appeared early during evolution , having conserved their functional identity through vertebrate phylogenesis .

16143545|The left and right amygdalae responded to both the emotion and the identity matching condition , and the only selective response to emotion matching was at the left inferior prefrontal sulcus .

16143545|The left amygdalar response habituated to emotion matching but not to identity matching .

16143545|We concluded that the amygdalar response to face matching is driven at least in part by relevance detection , independent of emotion processing , although there appears to be additional emotion-specific processing at the left amygdala .

16143498|Perhaps in FA + subjects an amygdaloid malfunction rendered the amygdala unable to correctly evaluate the emotional meaning of the pictures presented , thus preventing effective connectivity linking the amygdala to the brain regions implicated in the physiological and experiential dimensions of emotion .

16137725|The amygdala -LRB- AMY -RRB- plays an important role in initiating appropriate neurobehavioral responses to emotionally arousing events .

16125458|We found that these intense emotional alterations were associated with a decrease of synchrony between signals recorded from the neural networks known to be involved in emotional processing , and in particular a loss of synchrony between the orbito-frontal cortex and the amygdala .

16103019|Because the amygdala has important functional roles in epilepsy , emotion , and behavioral control , there may be common biological mechanisms involving neuronal excitability that contribute to both seizure activity and psychopathology .

16103019|This review examines physiological mechanisms in the amygdala that regulate neuronal excitability and discusses how this may underlie , in part , disturbances in emotional behavior .

16094315|Interestingly , these neonatally LPS-treated rats also showed increased cell loss in the central nucleus of the amygdala , a region that is important in the processing of emotional responses , but that is not usually examined in animal models of cerebral ischaemia .

16093387|Recent studies indicate that the basolateral amygdala exhibits fast rhythmic oscillations during emotional arousal , but the neuronal mechanisms underlying this activity are not known .

16093315|Prior work has highlighted the role of genetic variation within the repetitive sequence in the transcriptional control region of the serotonin -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- transporter gene -LRB- 5-HTT , SLC6A4 -RRB- in modulating amygdala and prefrontal activation to negative emotional stimuli .

16061516|The amygdala is a structure in the temporal lobe that has long been known to play a key role in emotional responses and emotional memory in both humans and nonhuman animals .

16061516|Growing evidence from recent neuroimaging studies points to a new , expanded role for the amygdala as a critical structure that mediates sex differences in emotional memory and sexual responses .

16061516|This review highlights current findings from studies of sex differences in human amygdala response during emotion-related activities , such as formation of emotional memories and sexual behavior , and considers how these findings contribute to the understanding of behavioral differences between men and women .

16056122|Using functional magnetic resonance imaging in a prospective study , we show that greater amygdala activation to emotional facial expressions among depressed patients predicts symptom reduction 8 months later , controlling for initial depression severity and medication status .

16055351|Whereas the right amygdala and bilateral superior temporal sulcus responded to anger prosody irrespective of whether it was heard from a to-be-attended or to-be-ignored voice , the orbitofrontal cortex and the cuneus in medial occipital cortex showed greater activation to the same emotional stimuli when the angry voice was to-be-attended rather than to-be-ignored .

16051026|Since the amygdala is a key brain structure in the processing of emotional information with distinct functions in each nucleus , GABA -LRB- A -RRB- receptors in the amygdala are an important target of treatment for emotional disorders .

16045505|Our data indicate that emotionally salient information processing is -LRB- i -RRB- mediated by the amygdala and -LRB- ii -RRB- more robust than for nonsalient stimuli as it shows a significantly lower perceptual threshold .

16044172|Here , we provide the first in vivo evidence that a relatively frequent regulatory variant -LRB- G -LRB- -844 -RRB- T -RRB- of hTPH2 biases the reactivity of the amygdala , a neural structure critical in the generation and regulation of emotional behaviors .

16043813|A critical period for the impact of amygdala damage on the emotional enhancement of memory ? .

16043813|The amygdala is crucial in modulating enhanced memory for emotionally arousing material .

16043813|The authors provide evidence that unilateral lesions of the human amygdala arising early in development , but not in adulthood , are associated with a loss of the expected superior retrieval of emotionally arousing over neutral material .

16037950|These drug-dependent neural adaptations may occur within brain systems that mediate reward , emotion , and cognitive function such as the amygdala complex .

16035629|Secondly , emotional features in dreams would be related to the activation of amygdalar complexes , orbito-frontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex .

16027178|Hence , these findings refine the current model of the amygdala function in emotional learning by showing that the BLA and the LA not only differentially contribute to elemental and context-US association , but also promote , through their interaction , the most relevant of these two associations .

16005438|Previous research indicates that hippocampus-dependent declarative memory benefits from early nocturnal sleep , when slow-wave sleep -LRB- SWS -RRB- prevails and cortisol release is minimal , whereas amygdala-dependent emotional memory is enhanced through late sleep , when rapid eye movement -LRB- REM -RRB- sleep predominates .

16005438|Metyrapone even amplified emotional enhancement in text recall indicating amygdala-dependent memory .

16005438|Cortisol blockade during sleep impairs hippocampus-dependent declarative memory formation but enhances amygdala-dependent emotional memory formation .

15993624|The evidence for amygdala processing of emotional items outside the focus of attention is mixed .

15993624|Reduced responses to unattended emotional stimuli may also reflect an active suppression of amygdala responses during difficult non-emotional tasks -LRB- cognitive modulation -RRB- .

15989934|Activity in emotion-processing regions -LRB- e.g. , orbitofrontal cortex , amygdala -RRB- reduced the likelihood of later misattributions , likely due in part to interactions with regions that promote memory accuracy -LRB- e.g. , the hippocampus -RRB- .

15987936|A subpopulation of neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex encodes emotional learning with burst and frequency codes through a dopamine D4 receptor-dependent basolateral amygdala input . .

15987936|The basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- are involved importantly in the processing and encoding of emotionally salient learned associations .

15979591|This emotional learning requires the involvement of higher brain structures , including the amygdala , hippocampus and related cortical structures .

15978846|Despite no significant differences being found in the subjective ratings of affective pictures across three sessions , compared to placebo , acute treatments of DA D2 receptor antagonists and SSRIs commonly attenuated the amygdala activity , although both treatments had slightly different modulatory effects on other components of the neural circuit of emotional processing .

15973681|Any alteration in the development of neurons and fibers containing calcium binding proteins of the pallial amygdala may result in important disorders of emotional and social behavior .

15961347|At the interplay of emotion , memory , dream , and temporal lobe seizure , we report on a patient with a left dysplastic amygdala and temporal lobe epilepsy who presented with a typical seizure while dreaming .

15957846|Concretely , the function of Gan in TCM may be , in the gross , related with the changes of multiple neurotransmitters and their synthetase produced in the process of CPSR -LRB- emotional disorder -RRB- regulation , such as neuropeptides , hormones , cyclic necleotide system and Fos protein expression , showing the characteristics of multiple links , multiple levels and multiple targets , with the effects involve several brain regions including various clusters of nuclei in hypothalamus , hippocampus and amygdala , etc. .

15955493|Whereas activation of medial temporal lobe structures during encoding specifically predicted subsequent memory when learning appears in a positive emotional context , activation of the anterior temporal cortex in a region with afferent input to the amygdala predicted memory for material learned in negative context .

15953488|In the brain , processing of fearful stimuli engages the amygdala , and the variability of its activity is associated with genetic factors as well as with emotional salience .

15947057|Left amygdala activation is more closely associated with cognitive processing and differentiation of facial emotions .

15936178|While age-related alterations have also been described in brain regions underlying emotional behavior -LRB- e.g. , the amygdala -RRB- , the functional consequence of such changes is less clear .

15935259|This increase of activation is probably modulated by top-down processes , that are initiated in emotion processing structures , specifically the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex .

15927407|Since exposure to chronic stress can induce profound effects in emotion and cognition , plasticity in specific amygdaloid nuclei in response to prior stress has been hypothesized to account for stress-induced emotional alterations .

15927244|Brain regions such as the amygdala , hippocampus and cortex , directly involved in the regulation of emotional behavior , contain high densities of CB1 receptors .

15926927|Whereas the amygdala complex is involved in emotional learning , the hippocampus plays a critical role in spatial and contextual learning .

15925697|The olfactory system in the rat forms a part of the limbic region in which the amygdala and hippocampus contribute to the emotional and memory components of behavior .

15925435|Here , we review deficits in the processing of emotion in schizophrenia , the role of the amygdala in the context of these deficits , and the functional implications of this relationship upon patient outcome .

15919215|However , activity in other regions corresponded with accurate retrieval specifically for emotional items -LRB- e.g. , in R amygdala/periamygdaloid cortex and L orbitofrontal cortex -RRB- or for neutral items -LRB- e.g. , in lateral inferior prefrontal cortex and R posterior hippocampus -RRB- .

15916857|Retrograde tracing methods revealed that DRDSh contains large numbers of neurons projecting to the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus , a forebrain structure important for emotional appraisal and modulation of anxiety-related physiological and behavioral responses .

15911871|Similar synaptic changes after fear conditioning are well documented in the amygdala and hippocampus , providing a link between emotional experiences and changes in neural activity .

15911871|The functional interconnection of the vermis with hypothalamus , amygdala , and hippocampus suggests a more complex role of the cerebellum as part of an integrated network regulating emotional behavior .

15897465|We show that the subliminal presentation of emotional words modulates the activity of the amygdala at a long latency -LRB- > 800 ms -RRB- .

15894059|It is conceivable that the lesions to the limbic structures involved in the origin of emotions ; the hippocampus , amygdala , and piriform cortex , may underlie changes in anxiety reactions in SRS rats .

15893118|The anterior hippocampus maintains the emotional component of a worldview through its interaction with the amygdala and hypothalamus , and supports executive frontal lobe activity by way of its output to the nucleus accumbens .

15880108|Morphometrical analyses showed reduced gray matter volume in short-allele carriers in limbic regions critical for processing of negative emotion , particularly perigenual cingulate and amygdala .

15880108|These genotype-related alterations in anatomy and function of an amygdala-cingulate feedback circuit critical for emotion regulation implicate a developmental , systems-level mechanism underlying normal emotional reactivity and genetic susceptibility for depression .

15877308|The amygdala is an important target of stress and mediates physiological and behavioral responses associated with fear and strong emotions .

15869492|Recapitulating emotional context : activity of amygdala , hippocampus and fusiform cortex during recollection and familiarity . .

15869492|The amygdala is thought to enhance long-term memory for emotionally arousing events by modulating memory formation and storage in the hippocampus and in neocortical areas .

15869492|The functional contributions of the amygdala to the retrieval of emotional memories in humans are less well known .

15869492|These data suggest that the amygdalae and hippocampi contribute to the retrieval of emotion-laden context memories by coordinating the reactivation of stored representations in neocortical areas , such as the FFA .

15869492|However , there also was a recapitulation of emotional study context in the right amygdala during familiarity only , which might therefore be related to affective implicit memory .

15869487|The amygdala mediates both emotional learning and fear potentiation of startle .

15869485|The central nucleus of amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- participates in cardiovascular regulation during emotional behaviour but it has not been established whether any of these effects are mediated through its direct connections to blood pressure-regulating neurones in the rostral ventrolateral medulla -LRB- RVLM -RRB- .

15862858|Consistent with other recent work , our findings indicate that emotion can facilitate visual identification , perhaps via a modulatory influence of the amygdala on extrastriate cortex .

15862513|Previous data have shown the amygdala to be important in mediating rapid auditory sensory processing involved in emotional conditioning .

15850746|Correlations showed a close link between negative emotion and amygdala decreased BOLD signal in adults , and between positive emotion and nucleus accumbens activation in adolescents .

15845098|Given the important role of the amygdaloid complex in the regulation of emotional behavior , we examined the mRNA levels of preprotachykinin A -LSB- PPT-A , a precursor of both SP and neurokinin A -LRB- NKA -RRB- -RSB- and 3H-SP binding sites in the amygdala of patients affected by bipolar disorder , major depression or schizophrenia as compared with matched control individuals .

15843623|In future studies , the cellular mechanisms of emotional memory storage might be pinpointed by identifying cellular processes that occur only in the amygdala contralateral but not ipsilateral from the US during lateralized fear conditioning .

15831401|Researchers have reported responses to emotional stimuli in the human amygdala under some unattended conditions -LRB- i.e. conditions in which the focus of attention was diverted away from the stimuli due to task instructions -RRB- , during visual masking and during binocular suppression .

15828421|-LSB- Correlation of unit activity of the right and left amygdala in food motivation and emotional stress -RSB- . .

15828421|Correlation between activities of neurons in the right and left central nuclei of amygdala of rabbits recorded during quiet wakefulness , after 24-h food deprivation , after satiation and during emotional stress -LRB- demonstration of a dog -RRB- was studied by plotting crosscorrelation histograms .

15820545|Neurobiology of emotion and high risk for schizophrenia : role of the amygdala and the X-chromosome . .

15820545|Abnormalities in emotion processing and in structure of the amygdala have consistently been documented in schizophrenia .

15820545|We propose that amygdala abnormalities are an endophenotype in schizophrenia and may account for subtle emotional processing deficits that have been described in these high-risk groups .

15805308|Lasting increases in basolateral amygdala activity after emotional arousal : implications for facilitated consolidation of emotional memories . .

15797028|Substantial evidence demonstrates that the amygdala contributes to the emotion of fear and the response to threat .

15788772|The amygdala and surrounding cortices of the medial temporal lobe may be a necessary component in the neural circuitry necessary for vivid recollection of unpleasant emotional events .

15787709|In keeping with heightened excitability in withdrawal from chronic diazepam treatment , the single withdrawal group showed , 72 h after their final dose of diazepam , increased -LSB- -LRB- 3 -RRB- H -RSB- Ro48 8587 binding in several brain areas associated with emotional responses or seizure activity , including hippocampal subfields , amygdalar and thalamic nuclei and motor cortex .

15784436|Naive individuals activated the primary gustatory cortex and brain areas , including the amygdala , implicated in emotional processing .

15782361|Implicit memory is a kind of unconscious and rigid memory for habits , which is based on brain regions processing perceptions and motor and emotional information , like the neocortex , the neostriatum , the cerebellum or the amygdala .

15780849|Contributions of amygdala and striatal activity in emotion regulation . .

15780849|The amygdala was recruited most for negative emotional context , and activity in this region was positively correlated with response time when detecting negative expressions .

15780849|We showed that recruitment of the amygdala , a region implicated in evaluating emotional significance , was associated with longer response latencies when approaching negative information , whereas recruitment of the caudate nucleus , a structure previously implicated in reward and impulse control , was most active when avoiding positive information .

15780186|Role of amygdala in mediating sexual and emotional behavior via coupled nitric oxide release . .

15780186|Although the anatomical configuration of the amygdala has been studied a great deal , very little research has been conducted on understanding the precise mechanism by which this emotional regulatory center exerts its control on emotional and sexual behavior .

15780186|By applying research methodology from the Neuroscience Research Institute , State University of New York , College at Old Westbury , we intended to demonstrate that much of the mediated effects of the amygdala , specifically the regulation of the male and female sexual response cycles , as well as related emotional considerations , exert their effects coupled to nitric oxide -LRB- NO -RRB- release .

15760935|Mechanisms of pain-related plasticity in the amygdala , a key player in emotionality , were studied at the cellular and molecular levels in a model of arthritic pain .

15755308|These results are interpreted with reference to amygdala dysfunction and components of the Integrated Emotion Systems model .

15755216|Fear-related processing in the amygdala has been well documented , but its role in signaling other emotions remains controversial .

15755216|The amygdala 's role in emotional evaluation thus extends to images of grief and despair as well as to those depicting violence and threat .

15753241|Dose-dependent decrease of activation in bilateral amygdala and insula by lorazepam during emotion processing . .

15753241|To determine whether lorazepam dose-dependently attenuates blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- BOLD fMRI -RRB- activation in the amygdala and associated limbic structures during an emotion face assessment task .

15753241|During fMRI , subjects completed an emotion face assessment task , which has been shown to elicit amygdala activation .

15753241|The BOLD-fMRI activation in amygdala , insula , and medial prefrontal cortex during the emotion face assessment task .

15753036|These data provide behavioral and fMRI evidence for right-lateralized emotional processing during bilateral stimulation involving enhanced coupling of the amygdala and right-hemispheric extrastriate cortex .

15750588|In addition , variation in eye fixation within autistic individuals was strongly and positively associated with amygdala activation across both studies , suggesting a heightened emotional response associated with gaze fixation in autism .

15746242|We analyzed the expression of the circadian clock protein Period2 -LRB- PER2 -RRB- in three regions of the limbic forebrain known to play key roles in emotional regulation , the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CEA -RRB- , the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , and the dentate gyrus -LRB- DG -RRB- .

15737660|We applied blood oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging and statistical parametric mapping to study amygdala responses to trauma-related and nontrauma-related emotional words in sexual/physical abuse PTSD and normal control subjects .

15737660|Our results demonstrate differential time courses and specificity of amygdala response to emotional and control stimuli in PTSD and normal control subjects .

15737660|The results also extend previous neuroimaging studies demonstrating relatively increased amygdala response in PTSD and expand these results to a largely female patient population probed with emotionally valenced words .

15735643|Neurobiological studies demonstrate the amygdala 's role in emotional memory , and psychological studies suggest a particular pattern : enhanced memory for the gist but not the details of complex stimuli .

15735643|Whereas normal -LRB- n = 52 -RRB- and brain-damaged -LRB- n = 22 -RRB- controls showed the expected enhancement of gist memory when the encoding context was emotional , persons with unilateral damage to the medial temporal lobe including the amygdala -LRB- n = 16 -RRB- did not show this pattern .

15730874|This specific histaminergic modulation of neuronal activity in the amygdala may play an important role in amygdala-mediated physiological and pathophysiological processes , such as fear , emotional learning and memory , temporal lobe epilepsy , and affective disorders .

15724459|-LSB- Evoked activity of the cat hypothalamus and amygdala under food motivation and in emotional stress -RSB- . .

15724459|Amplitude-latency characteristics of auditory evoked potentials -LRB- EPs -RRB- recorded in bilateral points of the lateral hypothalamus and amygdala were studied under food motivation , in emotional stress -LRB- presentation of dogs -RRB- and tentative reactions .

15722052|The hippocampus and the amygdala have long been associated with memory , emotion , and motivated behaviors .

15716473|Previous studies indicated that the amygdala , when activated by emotional or electrical stimulation , modulates hippocampal-dependent memory processes and synaptic plasticity .

15710316|Eating seizures and emotional facial paresis : evidence suggesting the amygdala is a common anatomophysiological substratum . .

15710316|This report provides evidence that the amygdala may be the common anatomical basis for three different aspects of this patient : emotional facial paresis , eating seizures , and sleep paroxysmal microarousals .

15708493|Thus , somatosensory recruitment may overcome the mild cognitive emotional deficits that are present in patients with PD owing to a dysfunction of the amygdala .

15707618|It has been suggested that the amygdala , a region implicated in emotion processing , is involved in generating IF .

15707618|As an underlying mechanism of the pre-surgical skewed perception of emotional stimuli , the abnormal epileptogenic circuits involving a hypersensitive amygdala possibly due to the kindling mechanism were suggested .

15703295|Remembering one year later : role of the amygdala and the medial temporal lobe memory system in retrieving emotional memories . .

15703295|Successful retrieval of emotional pictures elicited greater activity than successful retrieval of neutral pictures in the amygdala , entorhinal cortex , and hippocampus .

15703295|Moreover , in the amygdala and hippocampus , the emotion effect was greater for recollection than for familiarity , whereas in the entorhinal cortex , it was similar for both forms of retrieval .

15703295|These findings clarify the role of the amygdala and the medial temporal lobe memory regions in recollection and familiarity of emotional memory after lengthy retention intervals .

15701231|Patterns of activation were consistent with past findings demonstrating that the amygdala and part of the visual cortex were more active to emotionally evocative pictures than to neutral pictures and that the superior temporal sulcus was more active to social than to nonsocial pictures .

15701231|Furthermore , activation of the superior temporal sulcus and middle occipito-temporal cortex showed evidence of the interactive processing of emotional and social information , whereas activation of the amygdala showed evidence of additive effects .

15701231|These results indicate that interactive effects occur early in the stream of processing , suggesting that social and emotional information garner greater attentional resources and that the conjunction of social and emotional cues results in synergistic early processing , whereas the amygdala appears to be primarily implicated in processing biologically or personally relevant stimuli , regardless of the nature of the relevance -LRB- i. e. , social , emotional , or both -RRB- .

15699291|A recent functional magnetic resonance imaging study suggested that this association may be mediated by 5-HTTLPR effects on the response bias of the human amygdala-a brain region critical for emotional and social behavior-to environmental threat .

15699060|The present study sought to fill this gap in exploring how patients with amygdala resection recognize emotional expression in music .

15699060|To this aim , we tested 16 patients with left -LRB- LTR ; n = 8 -RRB- or right -LRB- RTR ; n = 8 -RRB- medial temporal resection -LRB- including amygdala -RRB- for the relief of medically intractable seizures and 16 matched controls in an emotion recognition task involving instrumental music .

15689961|Anterior limbic structures , such as the ventral striatum and the amygdala , have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and the generation of emotional responses , although few studies to date have used emotion probes to target these areas in schizophrenia .

15683980|Within this network , it is possible to distinguish : on one part structures such as the orbital and ventromedial prefrontal cortex , which are essential for the highest level of adaptive responses , allowing the individual to decode the variations of the emotional contingencies in real time , to integrate them into the behavior , and to maintain a behavioral choice during a long course , regardless of endogenous or environmental constraints ; on the other part structures like the amygdala allow to build stable and invariants behaviors , that can be automatically activated and are essential for survival and avoidance of noxious situations .

15677442|These findings support a role for CRH in the amygdala to promote consolidation of emotional memory and indicate that antagonism of CRH -LRB- 1 -RRB- receptors in the amygdala may prevent the development of exaggerated fear responses in stressed mice .

15677410|Preventing the natural increase in cortisol during REM sleep-rich sleep in the late night appears to enhance amygdala-dependent emotional memory .

15673663|Catechol-O-methyltransferase val158met genotype affects processing of emotional stimuli in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex . .

15670706|Parallel amygdala and inferotemporal activation reflect emotional intensity and fear relevance . .

15670706|Much research demonstrates that emotional stimuli prompt increased amygdala and visual cortical activation .

15670706|Here we measure functional activity in the visual cortex and amygdala with fMRI while selected fearful and control participants view a range of neutral , emotionally arousing , and fear-relevant pictures .

15670706|BOLD signal in the amygdala and inferotemporal visual cortex closely covaried during emotional picture viewing , increasing systematically with rated picture arousal .

15652324|Noradrenaline mediates amygdala activation in men and women during encoding of emotional material . .

15652324|The amygdala is a pivotal structure in humans for encoding of emotional information , as shown by recent imaging studies .

15652324|Betablockade selectively decreased amygdala activation for emotional pictures of the second highest category , but not for the highest or lower -LRB- neutral -RRB- category pictures .

15652324|First , the activation pattern in the amygdala under placebo condition shows a nonlinearity related to the emotional categories of the pictures .

15652324|Explorations with respect to gender show a similar effect of betablockade on amygdala activation in both men and women , but a difference in its effect on long-term memory for emotional pictures .

15652324|This study supports the hypothesis that the neurotransmitter noradrenaline also mediates amygdala activity in humans when processing emotional stimuli and that betablockers can disrupt the normal activation pattern in the amygdala .

15652310|The magnitude of evoked heart rate increase , both across the stimulus set and within each emotion category , was predicted by level of activity within a matrix of interconnected brain regions , including amygdala , insula , anterior cingulate , and brainstem .

15639031|These changes in brain systems are particularly targeted in psychiatric disorders to the areas which are sensitive to stress and play roles in memory and emotion -LRB- hippocampus , amygdala and prefrontal cortex -RRB- .

15635411|Since then , the importance of the amygdala in processing information about facial emotions has been borne out by a number of lesion and functional imaging studies .

15635411|This finding provides a mechanism to explain the amygdala 's role in fear recognition , and points to new approaches for the possible rehabilitation of patients with defective emotion perception .

15627583|Facial expressions of emotion elicit increased activity in the human amygdala .

15621382|The amygdala plays a key role in emotionality and is also involved in pain processing and pain modulation .

15618080|Synaptic plasticity in the amygdala is thought to underlie aversive or rewarding learning and emotional memories .

15610947|This study confirmed previous findings about the modulation of the startle reflex by emotional stimuli which may reflect activity of the amygdala and subcortical stimulus processing .

15601600|To assess the amygdala response to emotional faces in obsessive-compulsive disorder -LRB- OCD -RRB- using functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- .

15598549|Analyses of covariance suggest a further functional segregation with state anxiety being linked to enhanced activity in amygdala , perirhinal cortex , and tegmentum , and phobic fear with enhanced right hippocampal activity , suggesting a neuroanatomical differentiation between emotional-vegetative and cognitive aspects of -LRB- phobic -RRB- fear .

15597038|With anticipation minus rest , 8 phobics compared to 6 controls showed greater subcortical , limbic , and lateral paralimbic activity -LRB- pons , striatum , amygdala/uncus/anterior parahippocampus , insula , temporal pole -RRB- -- regions important in automatic emotional processing -- and less cortical activity -LRB- dorsal anterior cingulate/prefrontal cortex -RRB- -- regions important in cognitive processing .

15592466|Discriminating emotional faces without primary visual cortices involves the right amygdala . .

15592466|Functional magnetic resonance imaging showed activation of the right amygdala during the unconscious processing of emotionally expressive faces .

15576061|The amygdala is a limbic structure involved in the stress response and the regulation of emotional behaviors , both of which are disrupted in patients with neuropsychiatric illnesses .

15570506|Emotion induction differentially influenced cortical activation patterns in emotion related brain areas like the amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex .

15570506|The neural basis of emotional impairment could be a dysfunctional medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala .

15570505|In negative mood incompatible trials in contrast to compatible trials lead to significant decrease of activity in emotion related brain areas like the amygdala , the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex .

15563325|When the faces were presented for 30 ms , activation in the amygdala-a brain region associated with emotion-was greater for Black than for White faces .

15562506|Electrophysiological studies have suggested that noxiously activated PB neurons project to the amygdala , constituting a potential pathway for emotional aspects of pain .

15558065|In contrast , ` remember ' judgments for emotional photos were associated with enhanced activity in the amygdala , suggesting that subjects rely on arousal and perceptual fluency to evaluate these memories .

15550347|The amygdala , by contrast , is necessary for the consolidation of emotional memories .

15550347|Recent work has shown that acute tianeptine enhances cognitive and electrophysiological measures of HC-PFC functioning without interfering with the emotion-induced enhancement of amygdaloid functioning in rodents .

15548329|Elevated responses to constant facial emotions in different faces in the human amygdala : an fMRI study of facial identity and expression . .

15548329|Previous studies suggest a predominant role of the amygdala in the assessment of emotional variability .

15548329|Within this condition , amygdala activation was dependent on the type and intensity of displayed emotion , with significant responses to fearful expressions and , to a lesser extent so to neutral and happy expressions .

15548329|These results suggest that the amygdala might serve to detect constant facial emotions in different individuals , complementing its established role for detecting emotional variability .

15536493|In the present study , we investigated in male rats whether swim stress triggers the release of OXT in the central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , a key area in processing emotions and stress responses .

15519689|In fyn -LRB- - / - -RRB- females , hexanal also induced the activation of the medial preoptic area and the basolateral and posteriomedial cortical amygdala , which are known to be involved in the control of maternal and emotional behavior .

15519685|These findings suggest that the increased excitability of the specific amygdaloid subdivisions including the central nucleus , and of the projection targets such as the hypothalamus and midbrain in fyn -LRB- - / - -RRB- mice , is directly related to the enhanced fear response , and that the decreased excitability in the basolateral and lateral amygdaloid subdivisions is involved in the defective control of the neural circuit for emotional expression in this mutant .

15494727|Distant influences of amygdala lesion on visual cortical activation during emotional face processing . .

15494727|The distant influence of the amygdala was also evidenced by the parametric relationship between amygdala damage and the level of emotional activation in the fusiform cortex .

15488398|Functional neuroimaging studies examining the neural bases of the cognitive control of emotion have found increased prefrontal and decreased amygdala activation for the reduction or down-regulation of negative emotion .

15488398|Results indicated -LRB- 1a -RRB- that both up - and down-regulating negative emotion recruited prefrontal and anterior cingulate regions implicated in cognitive control , -LRB- 1b -RRB- that amygdala activation was modulated up or down in accord with the regulatory goal , and -LRB- 1c -RRB- that up-regulation uniquely recruited regions of left rostromedial PFC implicated in the retrieval of emotion knowledge , whereas down-regulation uniquely recruited regions of right lateral and orbital PFC implicated in behavioral inhibition .

15488397|In addition to the areas identified by the analysis of the average MEG data , statistically significant activity is identified in several other areas , including a sustained increase in the right amygdala activity in response to emotional faces in schizophrenic subjects .

15479679|The main centres affected were the amygdala , anterior cingulate cortex , hippocampus , insula , periaqueductal gray , and prefrontal cortex , which form part of the matrix controlling emotional , autonomic , and descending modulatory responses to pain .

15475623|This article focuses on the function of kainate receptors in the amygdala , a brain region that plays a central role in emotional behavior and certain psychiatric illnesses .

15474920|Impaired emotional learning and reduced amygdala size in schizophrenia : a 3-month follow-up . .

15474920|A relationship between behavioral variables of emotional processing and structural amygdala alterations in schizophrenia has been proposed but not shown , yet .

15474920|Volume of the right amygdala in subjects with schizophrenia and in controls was significantly related to emotional learning , indicating better learning in subjects with larger amygdala size .

15464739|In rats , acute -LRB- 1-2 h -RRB- restraint stress transiently reduces BDNF mRNA expression in the hippocampus , a region important in the memory and in HPA regulation ; restraint stress also decreases BDNF expression in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , a region important for fear consolidation and emotional memory .

15464410|Strong support for this view comes from studies that show double -LRB- or triple -RRB- dissociations between spatial , response , and emotional memories following selective lesions of hippocampus , striatum , and the amygdala .

15464407|The findings indicate -LRB- 1 -RRB- peripheral injections of anxiogenic drugs can influence the relative use of multiple memory systems in a manner that favors caudate-dependent habit learning over hippocampus-dependent cognitive learning , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- intra-basolateral amygdala infusion of anxiogenic drugs is sufficient to produce this modulatory influence of emotional state on the use of multiple memory systems .

15457506|Our findings lend further support to the view that the PDVR and neighboring structures constitute the reptilian basolateral amygdala and indicate that an emotional brain was already present in the ancestral amniote .

15453980|The study also showed an increased activity in the rostral part of anterior cingulate cortex in the same context in which the amygdala activity decreased , further supporting the idea that this part of the cingulate cortex is involved in the modulation of emotional and pain networks .

15451699|They also increase mRNA expression of activity-dependent genes -LRB- c-fos and zif/268 -RRB- in brain regions specialized for processing faces -LRB- temporal and medial frontal cortices and basolateral amygdala -RRB- and for emotional control -LRB- orbitofrontal and cingulate cortex -RRB- , and reduce their expression in regions associated with stress responses -LRB- hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus -RRB- and fear -LRB- central and lateral amygdala -RRB- .

15450161|Molecular mechanisms underlying emotional learning and memory in the lateral amygdala . .

15449355|Startle reflex changes , associated with the valence of a stimulus , correlated with activity in the amygdala , while verbal reports of negative emotional valence varied with insular activity .

15383744|The poor perception of emotion could worsen differently in AD and in FTD , with the progression of atrophy of the amygdala , the anterior temporal cortex and the orbital frontal cortex , structures that are components of the brain 's emotional processing systems .

15370359|In studies of emotional recall as well as in neuroimaging studies of hypnotic processes similar brain structures are involved : thalamus , hippocampus , amygdala , medial prefrontal cortex , anterior cingulate cortex .

15337374|Interactions between NPY and CRF in the amygdala to regulate emotionality . .

15337374|In this article , we review the scientific literature describing the NPY-CRF relationship , specifically as it relates to the modulation of the CRF-mediated stress responses via the amygdala , a key forebrain structure involved in the regulation of emotional states .

15335339|Functional neuroimaging studies in adults highlight the role of the amygdala in emotion processing .

15312899|An important output of amygdaloid nuclei , the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- not only mediates negative emotional behaviors , but also participates in the stimulus-reward learning and expression of motivational aspects of many drugs of abuse , and links environmentally stressful conditions such as fear to endogenous pain-inhibiting mechanisms .

15312809|The sight of one 's own child versus that of a familiar child activates regions that mediate emotional responses -LRB- amygdala , insula -RRB- and are associated with theory of mind functions -LRB- anterior paracingulate cortex , posterior superior temporal sulcus -RRB- .

15305238|Consistent with morphological findings , which report alterations in regions of emotionally relevant networks of the brain in depressive disorders , findings of functional studies point to changes in the basal ganglia , the frontal cortex and the limbic system involving the hippocampus and the amygdala .

15305238|During processing of emotional cues depressive patients show different activation patterns in the regions of the frontal lobe and the amygdala .

15298786|The amygdala was selectively activated when subjects were processing social emotions , both related to self and other .

15282713|Projections from the amygdala to the piriform cortex are proposed to provide a pathway via which the emotional system can modulate the processing of olfactory information as well as mediate the spread of seizure activity in epilepsy .

15280883|These data suggest the CeA is an important neural substrate subserving the interactions between cannabinoids and environmental stress , and could be relevant to understanding the context-dependent emotional and affective changes induced by marijuana intoxication and the role of endocannabinoid signaling in the modulation of amygdalar activity .

15275785|The anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , and amygdala are thought to be key neural substrates underlying emotional responses .

15275785|Using formalin-induced conditioned place avoidance -LRB- F-CPA -RRB- and electric foot-shock conditioned place avoidance -LRB- S-CPA -RRB- models , the present study observed the effects of bilateral excitotoxic -LRB- quinolinic acid 200 nmol/microl -RRB- lesions of the ACC and amygdala on pain and fear induced negative emotion , as well as on sensory component of pain .

15275785|These results suggest that the amygdala is involved in both pain - and fear-related negative emotion , and the ACC might play a critical role in the expression of pain-related negative emotion .

15269349|Beta-adrenergic modulation of emotional memory-evoked human amygdala and hippocampal responses . .

15269349|We have used functional magnetic resonance imaging to demonstrate that successful encoding of emotional , compared to neutral , verbal stimuli evokes increased human amygdala responses .

15269349|Thus , memory-related amygdala responses at encoding and hippocampal responses at recognition for emotional items depend on beta-adrenergic engagement at encoding .

15269349|Our results suggest that human emotional memory is associated with a beta-adrenergic-dependent modulation of amygdala-hippocampal interactions .

15262319|In addition to seizure evolution amygdala kindling enhances emotionality .

15261117|We have recently found that synaptic pathway from the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- to the dentate gyrus -LRB- DG -RRB- displays N-methyl-D-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- receptor-independent form of long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- , which should be a valuable model for elucidating neural mechanisms linking emotion and memory .

15257156|Predominant BOLD signal change to the contrasts of infants minus neutral stimulus occurred in bilateral visual processing regions -LRB- BA 19,21,37,38 -RRB- ; to own infant minus unknown infant in right anterior temporal pole -LRB- BA 38 -RRB- , left amygdala and visual cortex -LRB- BA 19 -RRB- , and to the unknown infant minus own infant contrast in bilateral orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- BA 10,47 -RRB- and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- BA 8 -RRB- -LSB- corrected -RSB- These findings suggest that amygdala and temporal pole may be key sites in mediating a mother 's response to her infant and reaffirms their importance in face emotion processing and social behaviour .

15251913|The deficits of executive control of emotions and impulses of adult BD implicate involvement of a ventral prefrontal cortex -LRB- VPFC -RRB- neural system that subserves these functions that include the VPFC , as well as its subcortical connection sites of amygdala , striatum , and thalamus .

15249111|Stimulation of amygdaloid nuclei and emotionally relevant stimuli are known to influence the induction and maintenance of long-term potentiation in the hippocampal formation and the formation of long-term declarative memories .

15233764|Fear conditioning is a model of emotional memory and anxiety that is expressed as an enduring increase in synaptic strength in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- .

15233764|Collectively , these results show that during maintenance of fear memory the stimulus requirements for amygdala afferents and critical signaling mechanisms for amygdala synaptic potentiation are altered , suggesting that cue-engaged synaptic mechanisms in the amygdala are dramatically affected as a result of emotional learning .

15232736|The amygdalohypothalamic projection , a major component of the stria terminalis , is involved in the conduction of emotional and olfactory information integrated in the amygdala to the hypothalamus to elicit emotional reactions .

15225971|The latter 's role in emotional processing is also distinct from that of the amygdala , which is associated specifically with fear .

15220170|Memory modulation by negative emotion is mediated by the amygdala .

15219596|In particular , decreased activation in the right amygdala and MPFC appears to be an important finding related to dysfunctional emotional behavior in schizophrenia .

15217324|The amygdala modulates the consolidation of memories of emotionally arousing experiences . .

15217324|Converging findings of animal and human studies provide compelling evidence that the amygdala is critically involved in enabling us to acquire and retain lasting memories of emotional experiences .

15217324|The findings of human brain imaging studies are consistent with those of animal studies in suggesting that activation of the amygdala influences the consolidation of long-term memory ; the degree of activation of the amygdala by emotional arousal during encoding of emotionally arousing material -LRB- either pleasant or unpleasant -RRB- correlates highly with subsequent recall .

15215294|This is the first evidence for an important role of the amygdala , a limbic structure known to be involved in social and emotional behavior , in discrimination of species specificity in chemosignals .

15193632|The amygdala processes the emotional significance of facial expressions : an fMRI investigation using the interaction between expression and face direction . .

15193632|Neuroimaging studies have shown activity in the amygdala in response to facial expressions of emotion , but the specific role of the amygdala remains unknown .

15193632|We hypothesized that the amygdala is involved in emotional but not basic sensory processing for facial expressions .

15193632|The left amygdala showed the interaction between emotional expression and face direction , indicating higher activity for angry expressions looking toward the subjects than angry expressions looking away from them .

15193632|Regression analysis showed a positive relation between the left amygdala activity and experienced emotion .

15193632|These results suggest that the amygdala is involved in emotional but not visuoperceptual processing for emotional facial expressions , which specifically includes the decoding of emotional significance and elicitation of one 's own emotions corresponding to that significance .

15193617|In addition , there was engagement of structures linked more specifically to emotional processing , including the amygdala , orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex .

15187885|Structural brain imagery has revealed volumetric alterations of the amygdala , a major participant in emotional and fear responses .

15187808|To determine whether expertise in the attribution of emotion from basic facial expressions in high-functioning individuals with autistic spectrum disorder -LRB- ASD -RRB- is supported by the amygdala , fusiform , and prefrontal regions of interest -LRB- ROI -RRB- and is comparable to that of typically developing individuals .

15182723|Interaction between the amygdala and the medial temporal lobe memory system predicts better memory for emotional events . .

15182723|Successful encoding activity in the amygdala and MTL memory structures was greater and more strongly correlated for emotional than for neutral pictures .

15169855|Sex-related hemispheric lateralization of amygdala function in emotionally influenced memory : an FMRI investigation . .

15169855|The amygdala appears necessary for enhanced long-term memory associated with emotionally arousing events .

15169855|Recent brain imaging investigations support this view and indicate a sex-related hemispheric lateralization exists in the amygdala relationship to memory for emotional material .

15169855|These results provide the strongest evidence to date of a sex-related hemispheric lateralization of amygdala function in memory for emotional material .

22034132|The amygdala , which is important for '' emotional memories , '' becomes hyperactive in posttraumatic stress disorder and depressive illness , in animal models of stress , there is evidence for growth and hypertrophy of nerve cells in the amygdala .

15163693|The WS group also showed disproportionate increases in volume and gray matter density in several areas known to participate in emotion and face processing , including the amygdala , orbital and medial prefrontal cortices , anterior cingulate , insular cortex , and superior temporal gyrus .

15155523|These deficits held for subjects with either left or right early amygdala damage and encompassed the understanding of both the beliefs and emotional states of others .

15155061|Whereas a key role of the amygdala in the neuronal mechanisms of emotionality and affective disorders has been well established , the concept of the amygdala as an important contributor to pain and its emotional component is still emerging .

15155061|This article will review and discuss evidence from anatomical , neuroimaging , behavioral , electrophysiological , pharmacological , and biochemical data that implicate the amygdala in pain modulation and emotional responses to pain .

15155061|It is conceivable , however , that amygdala plasticity plays an important role in emotional pain behavior and its modulation by affective state .

15145620|Functional neuroimaging studies of emotion processing consistently report amygdala activation .

15145620|Because individual studies use varying paradigms and are limited by statistical power and sensitivity , it has remained unclear whether the left or the right amygdala is more consistently involved in emotional processing .

15145620|Our findings indicate that across studies , the left amygdala is more often activated than the right amygdala , suggesting different roles for the left and right amygdalae in emotional processing .

15135941|The amygdala plays a key role in the emotional-affective component of pain .

15130591|A main effect of emotion was found in the amygdala -LRB- AMG -RRB- and ventral frontotemporal cortices .

15129783|The present study examined the effects of glucocorticoid administration on emotional memory and on corticotropin-releasing hormone -LRB- CRH -RRB- mRNA expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus -LRB- PVN -RRB- .

15123799|Converging evidence supports a role for the amygdala , a collection of nuclei in the temporal lobe , in processing emotionally and socially relevant information .

15123799|This finding extends the role of the amygdala to the social attributions we make even to stimuli that are not explicitly social and , in so doing , suggests that the human capacity for anthropomorphizing draws on some of the same neural systems as do basic emotional responses .

15120595|We found that 90 min after oral ovalbumin -LRB- OVA -RRB- challenge , allergic mice present increased c-fos expression in emotionality-related brain areas such as the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus -LRB- PVN -RRB- and the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- .

15115945|Neuroimaging work consistently points to the involvement of the fusiform gyrus and amygdala in emotion processing , while the medial prefrontal and frontal cortex are implicated in tasks invoking theory of mind .

15110733|Interpretation of amygdala responses to facial expressions of emotion will be influenced by considering the contribution of each constituent condition within a greater subtractive finding , as well as 1 -RRB- their spatial location within the amygdaloid complex ; and 2 -RRB- the experimental context in which they were observed .

15098356|-LSB- A role of the amygdala and frontal lobe in social cognition and emotion -RSB- . .

15087581|Bilateral amygdala damage has been linked with an inability to recognise facial expressions of emotion , particularly the expression of fear .

15082325|Human emotion and memory : interactions of the amygdala and hippocampal complex . .

15082325|The hippocampal complex , by forming episodic representations of the emotional significance and interpretation of events , can influence the amygdala response when emotional stimuli are encountered .

15081788|A key player in emotionality , the amygdala is also involved in pain processing .

15079138|Functional activation studies have implicated hyperactive or altered functioning of brain regions , such as the amygdala and the insula , and a failure to engage emotional regulatory structures , such as the medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex .

15078562|Furthermore , they support a differential involvement of the amygdala and hippocampus in memory formation and storage depending on the emotional characteristics of the experience .

15075447|In contrast , in a women predominant population of IBS patients , we did not observed any neuronal activation in locations activated in healthy volunteers -LRB- ACC , dorsolateral PFC -RRB- while a significant deactivation was observed in the IC and in the amygdala , a limbic structure with a role to assign emotional significance to a current experience related to anxiety and fear .

15072680|Although the amygdala 's role in processing facial expressions of fear has been well established , its role in the processing of other emotions is unclear .

15072680|The findings suggest that the amygdala 's role in processing of emotional facial expressions encompasses multiple negatively valenced emotions , including fear and sadness .

15071094|Corticotrophin releasing factor-induced synaptic plasticity in the amygdala translates stress into emotional disorders . .

15071094|The amygdala is involved in the associative processes for both appetitive and aversive emotions , and its function is modulated by stress hormones .

15050573|Findings for the overt condition -LRB- 170 ms -RRB- confirm previous evidence of amygdala activation to fearful faces , and insula activation to disgusted faces , and a double dissociation between these two emotions .

15050549|Conjunction analysis showed that masked affect perception , regardless of emotional valence , was associated with greater activation within the left amygdala and left anterior cingulate .

15048050|This paper will review observations in several regions of interest in limbic -LRB- eg , amygdala , anterior cingulate cortex -RRB- and paralimbic -LRB- eg , medial prefrontal cortex , insula -RRB- brain regions in emotional responding .

15043644|We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess whether amygdala activation in response to positive and negative emotional pictures changes with age .

15043644|Both older and younger adults showed greater activation in the amygdala for emotional than for neutral pictures ; however , for older adults , seeing positive pictures led to greater amygdala activation than seeing negative pictures , whereas this was not the case for younger adults .

15026504|The human amygdala is implicated in the formation of emotional memories and the perception of emotional stimuli -- particularly fear -- across various modalities .

15026504|Patients with bilateral amygdala damage had greater impairment , particularly on the narrative test of emotional memory , one showing superior fear recognition but absent memory enhancement .

15026504|Bilateral amygdala damage is particularly disruptive of emotional memory processes in comparison with unilateral temporal lobectomy .

15024126|Substance P in the medial amygdala : emotional stress-sensitive release and modulation of anxiety-related behavior in rats . .

15024126|Therefore , we examined in rats whether the release of SP is sensitive to emotional stressors in distinct subregions of the amygdala , a key area in processing of emotions .

15016717|In the central nucleus of the amygdala , corticotropin-releasing factor mRNA was significantly elevated in leptin-treated animals , suggesting a role in affective and/or emotional aspects of food intake .

15013825|Therefore , we measured the levels of phosphorylated CREB -LRB- pCREB -RRB- in the amygdala , a region critical to emotional processing and important in the pathophysiology of both BD and MDD .

15013823|Role of amygdala oscillations in the consolidation of emotional memories . .

15013823|Much evidence indicates that emotional arousal generally improves memory and that the amygdala is responsible for this effect .

15013823|The available data suggest that stress hormones and neuromodulators released in emotionally arousing conditions alter the activity of basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- neurons in the hours after the learning episode .

15003392|The amygdala has been implicated in a variety of functions , ranging from attention to memory to emotion .

14993415|Spinal pathways to the amygdala , hypothalamus , reticular formation , medial thalamic nuclei , and limbic cortical structures transmit information involved arousal , bodily regulation , and emotional responses .

14993040|The ERalpha mRNA dominates in the amygdala and hypothalamus , suggesting estrogen modulation of autonomic and neuroendocrine as well as emotional functions .

14987446|The amygdala , the hippocampus , and emotional modulation of memory . .

14987446|There are two views regarding the role of the amygdala in emotional memory formation .

14987446|According to the other , the amygdala is a site for some aspects of emotional memory .

14987446|This integrative view , however , suggests a level of complexity not referred to before : the assumption that emotional conditions induce long-term neural plasticity in the amygdala suggests that the interrelations between the amygdala and brain regions , such as the hippocampus , may not be static but dynamic .

14980580|Activity in the amygdala was specifically related to affective judgments and emotional intensity .

14977249|Limbic structures -LRB- enthorinal cortex , hippocampus , and amygdala -RRB- are essential for the cognitive processes and emotional behaviour .

14962631|Recent evidence from neurobiology show that one brain area , the amygdala , plays a pivotal role in processing social emotions .

14960499|These findings suggest that pain catastrophizing , independent of the influence of depression , is significantly associated with increased activity in brain areas related to anticipation of pain -LRB- medial frontal cortex , cerebellum -RRB- , attention to pain -LRB- dorsal ACC , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -RRB- , emotional aspects of pain -LRB- claustrum , closely connected to amygdala -RRB- and motor control .

14766647|While work on the rodent amygdala often deals with emotion , much of the research in nonhuman primates and in man deals with its role in the perception of social signals , such as facial expressions , and the maintenance of social position , such as in primate dominance hierarchies .

14766193|Here we asked whether prenatal stress also has an impact on the development of the amygdala , because this structure plays a direct role in the emotions of anxiety and fear .

14758364|Encoding of emotional memories depends on amygdala and hippocampus and their interactions . .

14758364|We have studied patients with variable degrees of left hippocampal and amygdala pathology who performed a verbal encoding task during functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- to assess the impact of pathology on emotional-memory performance and encoding-evoked activity .

14758364|The severity of left hippocampal pathology predicted memory performance for neutral and emotional items alike , whereas the severity of amygdala pathology predicted memory performance for emotional items alone .

14758364|Encoding-related hippocampal activity for successfully remembered emotional items correlated with the degree of left amygdala pathology .

14758364|Conversely , amygdala-evoked activity with respect to subsequently remembered emotional items correlated with the degree of left hippocampal pathology .

14758364|Our data indicate a reciprocal dependence between amygdala and hippocampus during the encoding of emotional memories .

14756586|They describe how the nucleus accumbens acts as a gateway to integrate cognitive information from the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus with emotional information from the amygdala .

14744467|Networks supporting autonomic and emotional control and preparatory motor action -LRB- amygdala , anterior cingulate , subcallosal gyrus , and premotor cortex -RRB- differed between the two groups and became progressively disparate with successive presentations of the traumatic script .

14711973|To assess whether there is a hemispheric functional specialization for the processing of emotion or reward or both in nonhuman primates , rhesus monkeys -LRB- Macaca mulatta -RRB- with combined lesions of the amygdala and PFo in one hemisphere , either left or right , were compared with unoperated controls on a battery of tasks that tax affective processing , including two tasks that tax reward processing and two that assess emotional reactions .

14696720|Some of the key circuitry underlying approach and withdrawal components of emotion is reviewed with an emphasis on the role played by different sectors of the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- and amygdala .

14689142|Functional brain imaging has shown that expressions of fear and anger selectively activate the amygdala , even when the faces conveying the emotion are presented briefly and masked to prevent conscious perception -LRB- Morris et al. 1998 ; Whalen et al. 1998 -RRB- .

14683713|Considerable evidence from both animal and human subject research supports the hypothesis that the amygdala , when activated by emotional arousal , modulates memory storage processes in other brain regions .

14683713|By this hypothesis , changes in the functional interactions of the amygdala with other brain regions during emotional conditions should underlie , at least in part , enhanced memory for emotional material .

14683713|Here we examined the influence of the human amygdala on other brain regions under emotional and nonemotional learning conditions using structural equation modeling -LRB- SEqM -RRB- .

14683713|Enhanced activity in the right amygdala was related to enhanced memory for the emotional films .

14683713|A subset of regions identified by this analysis showing differences functional connectivity with the amygdala between the emotional versus neutral film conditions were then submitted to SEqM , which revealed significantly increased amygdala influences on the ipsilateral parahippocampal gyrus and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during the emotional relative to the neutral film viewing condition .

14683713|These findings support the view that increased influences from the amygdala , presumably reflecting its memory-modulation function , occur during emotionally arousing learning situations .

14677078|There was a significant interaction between valence of emotional stimuli and gender in the sublenticular extended amygdala -LRB- SLEA -RRB- and the rostral anterior cingulate .

14672157|These emotions were most consistently associated in activity in regions associated with selective processing deficits when damaged : the amygdala , the insula and globus pallidus , and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex , respectively .

14670575|fMRI analyses indicated significantly greater activation in the amygdala and hippocampal regions during recall to the personally significant odor than any other cue , and behavioral responses confirmed that emotional responses were greatest to the personally meaningful odor .

14670575|These findings provide convincing neurobiological evidence that the subjective experience of the emotional potency of odor-evoked memory is correlated with specific activation in the amygdala during recall and offers new insights into the affective organization of memory .

14668442|Juvenile emotional experience alters synaptic composition in the rodent cortex , hippocampus , and lateral amygdala . .

14659478|Both the hemispheric involvement of the human amygdala in memory for emotionally arousing events and the impairing effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on memory for emotional events , exhibit sex-related differences .

14657162|The amygdala plays a role in learning and memory processes that involve an emotional component .

14653306|Recently , functional neuroimaging has provided a dramatic illustration of how a promoter polymorphism in the human 5-HT transporter -LRB- 5-HTT -RRB- gene , which has been weakly related to these behaviors , is strongly related to the engagement of neural systems , namely the amygdala , subserving emotional processes .

14650848|Contrary to this prevailing view , in a recent study we found that all brain regions responding differentially to faces with emotional content , including the amygdala , did so only when sufficient resources were available to process those faces .

14650848|After reviewing our findings , we discuss their implications , in particular -LRB- 1 -RRB- how emotional stimuli can bias competition for processing resources ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the source of the biasing signal for emotional stimuli ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- how visual information reaches the amygdala ; and finally -LRB- 4 -RRB- the relationship between attention and awareness .

14648680|Cellular coexistence of 5-HT3A and CB1 transcripts in interneurons of the cortex , hippocampal formation , and amygdala suggest possible interactions between the cannabinoid and serotonergic systems at the level of GABA neurotransmission in brain areas involved in cognition , memory , and emotion .

14643096|The amygdala plays important roles in modulating vigilance and generating negative emotional states and is often abnormally reactive in disorders of mood and emotion .

14643096|We hypothesized that amygdala hyperreactivity contributes to hypervigilance , emotional dysregulation , and disturbed interpersonal relations in BPD .

14643096|Borderline patients showed significantly greater left amygdala activation to the facial expressions of emotion -LRB- vs. a fixation point -RRB- compared with normal control subjects .

14643096|Pictures of human emotional expressions elicit robust differences in amygdala activation levels in borderline patients , compared with normal control subjects , and can be used as probes to study the neuropathophysiologic basis of borderline personality disorder .

14642483|The amygdala is related to recognition of faces and emotions , and functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- studies have reported that the amygdala is habituated over time with repetition of facial stimuli .

14629927|We have recently suggested the Emotional Tagging concept , according to which the activation of the amygdala in emotionally arousing events mark the experience as important and aids in enhancing synaptic plasticity in other brain regions .

14629927|Here , we review evidence from both human and animal studies that lend support to the Emotional Tagging hypothesis and to the central role the amygdala may play in its formation .

14629927|Interestingly and relevant to the Emotional Tagging hypothesis , it has been recently shown that the activation of the amygdala could transform transient into long-lasting plasticity .

14625149|Subjects viewed emotionally expressive and neutral faces , and amygdala blood oxygenation level dependent responses from each group were compared .

14622196|The amygdala is a forebrain structure composed of several distinct nuclei including the basolateral -LRB- BLA -RRB- and central -LRB- CeA -RRB- nuclei , and is thought to be a key neural substrate underlying emotional responses .

14622162|Considerable evidence indicates that the noradrenergic system in the amygdala plays an important role in memory consolidation for emotionally arousing experiences .

14614087|The amygdala plays a critical role in fear conditioning , a model of emotional learning and cue-induced anxiety .

14614086|Processing of the arousal of subliminal and supraliminal emotional stimuli by the human amygdala . .

14614086|The amygdala is known to play an important role in conscious and unconscious processing of emotional and highly arousing stimuli .

14614086|Neuroanatomical evidence suggests that the amygdala participates in the control of autonomic responses , such as skin conductance responses -LRB- SCRs -RRB- , elicited by emotionally salient stimuli , but little is known regarding its functional role in such control .

14614086|We investigated this issue by showing emotional visual stimuli of varying arousal to patients with left -LRB- n = 12 -RRB- , right -LRB- n = 8 -RRB- , and bilateral -LRB- n = 3 -RRB- amygdala damage and compared their results with those from 38 normal controls .

14614086|Our results provide support for the hypothesis that the left and right amygdalae subserve different functions in emotion processing : the left may decode the arousal signaled by the specific stimulus , whereas the right may provide a global level of autonomic activation triggered automatically by any arousing stimulus .

14597304|The additional presence of left amygdala sclerosis resulted in reorganisation for encoding of emotional verbal material to right amygdala .

14595032|An emotion-induced retrograde amnesia in humans is amygdala - and beta-adrenergic-dependent . .

14570552|Monkeys with bilateral neurotoxic amygdala lesions and normal monkeys were administered tests of emotional reactivity , recognition memory , and reward association memory .

14570552|First , monkeys with amygdala lesions performed differently than normal monkeys on initial administrations of the emotional reactivity tests and on retests that were given 21-23 months after surgery .

14570552|These findings underscore the role of the amygdala in aspects of emotional reactivity and reward association memory , but not in recognition memory .

14536022|Descending pathways from orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal cortices , which are also linked with the amygdala , provide the means for speedy influence of the prefrontal cortex on the autonomic system , in processes underlying appreciation and expression of emotions .

14532911|The amygdala is a key component of the brain 's neuronal network that processes and assigns emotional value to life 's experiences , consolidates the memory of emotionally significant events , and organizes the behavioral response to these events .

14527572|The amygdala and fusiform cortex responded to high-intensity expressions of all emotions , independent of task .

14527572|The results suggest that amygdala contributes to task-independent perceptual processing of a range of emotions .

14521190|It is known that the limbic system is important for learning and memory , and that the amygdala plays a role in emotion and behaviour .

14514027|The emotional brain , fear , and the amygdala . .

14511699|This paper reviews data indicating that the amygdala is responsible for this facilitation of memory by emotional arousal .

14511344|Several studies implicate a role for the amygdala in processing of emotional memories that might partially occur in the connections between the amygdala and the hippocampal-parahippocampal areas .

14499285|It has been proved that there are the subfornical organ -LRB- SFO -RRB- - nucleus paraventricularis -LRB- NPV -RRB- - rostral ventrolateral medulla -LRB- RVL -RRB- angiotension II -LRB- AngII -RRB- pressor system and the central amygdaloid nucleus -LRB- AC -RRB- - lateral hypothalamus/perifornical region -LRB- LH/PF -RRB- emotional pressor system in the brain .

13678519|Evidence suggests a two-stage process : First , emotional significance is evaluated preattentively by a sub-cortical circuit involving the amygdala ; and second , stimuli deemed emotionally significant are given priority in the competition for access to selective attention .

13129808|Preliminary findings show that PTSD patients and combat controls had differential blood flow patterns during emotional recall in amygdala , insula and medial prefrontal cortex .

12975524|-LRB- i -RRB- GCs increase the expression of corticotropin-releasing factor -LRB- CRF -RRB- mRNA in the central nucleus of the amygdala , a critical node in the emotional brain .

12967919|Brain regions implicated in processing facial affect , including the amygdala and fusiform gyrus , showed greater responses to dynamic versus static emotional expressions , especially for fear .

12967919|Identity morphs activated a dorsal fronto-cingulo-parietal circuit and additional ventral areas , including the amygdala , that also responded to the emotion morphs .

12958079|The amygdala , which plays a critical role in emotional learning and social cognition , is structurally and functionally sexually dimorphic in humans .

12953293|Structural changes in the hippocampus and amygdala , which are important brain structures for cognition and emotion , are representative of what may be occurring throughout the brain as a result of allostatic load resulting from the chronic stress of a disorder such as depression .

12949652|Transcutaneous allotransplantation of embryonic tissues from the anterior hypothalamus and amygdaloid complex and administration of potentiated antibodies to bombesin normalized blood pressure and parameters of ECG in rats with emotional hypertension .

12946880|We have previously discussed two neural systems : 1 -RRB- a ventral system , including the amygdala , insula , ventral striatum , ventral anterior cingulate gyrus , and prefrontal cortex , for identification of the emotional significance of a stimulus , production of affective states , and automatic regulation of emotional responses ; and 2 -RRB- a dorsal system , including the hippocampus , dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus , and prefrontal cortex , for the effortful regulation of affective states and subsequent behavior .

12946879|Findings from these studies indicate that these processes may be dependent upon the functioning of two neural systems : a ventral system , including the amygdala , insula , ventral striatum , and ventral regions of the anterior cingulate gyrus and prefrontal cortex , predominantly important for processes 1 and 2 and automatic regulation of emotional responses ; and a dorsal system , including the hippocampus and dorsal regions of anterior cingulate gyrus and prefrontal cortex , predominantly important for process 3 .

12943324|Ignoring color-incongruent words increased left parietal activity and decreased parahippocampal gyrus activity , whereas ignoring negative emotional words increased bilateral occipito-temporal activity and decreased amygdala activity .

12937075|This suggests that the human amygdala influences both negative and positive emotional processing .

12931960|This study examined the effects of intense emotional learning on the sleep-wake state-specific electroencephalographic -LRB- EEG -RRB- activities of the basolateral -LRB- BLA -RRB- and central -LRB- CeA -RRB- nuclei of the amygdala .

12928506|The amygdala , including its extended amygdala component , is involved in evaluating the emotional value of sensory stimuli .

12928506|Since emotionally relevant sensory stimuli are distorted during psychotic episodes , we hypothesize that amygdaloid influences are likely to be significant modulators of the DA system .

12928506|We reviewed evidence for direct projections from the central extended amygdala to specific subpopulations of DA neurons , and we discuss how these pathways may serve as important conduits of emotionally relevant information that can have immediate and long-term effects on DA regulation .

12927220|The amygdala is a temporal lobe region that is implicated in emotional information processing .

12916648|Eighteen patients who had undergone standard anterior temporal lobectomy including removal of the amygdala and hippocampus -LRB- 9 left , LTL ; 9 right , RTL -RRB- were administered an Affective Task composed of faces depicting negative emotions , and a Neutral Task consisting of faces with different lighting and orientation conditions .

12899188|Comparison of emotional responses in monkeys with rhinal cortex or amygdala lesions . .

12883925|Clinicometabolic correlations between several emotional and social parameters and metabolic patterns in the frontal cortex and amygdala were investigated in 32 patients with frontal lobe pathologies .

12883925|Impulsiveness , personality disturbances and loss of emotional control were associated with decreased metabolism in the left amygdala .

12883925|In particular , they imply that the classically described symptoms of impaired behavioral control may be related to right orbitofrontal cortex hypometabolism whereas impaired regulation of emotions may result from a functional damage of the left amygdala .

12880911|In summary , our results suggest that increases in neural processing in the amygdala facilitate the analysis of gaze cues when a person is actively monitoring for emotional gaze events , whereas increases in neural processing in the superior temporal sulcus support the analysis of gaze cues that provide socially meaningful spatial information .

12880790|The differential sensitivity of the amygdala and visual cortex to traumatic context implies distinct roles of limbic and sensory regions in the registration and recollection of emotional experience in the brain .

12874501|They demonstrate the feasibility of using happy facial expressions to noninvasively study amygdalar function in adolescents and establish a baseline against which the amygdalar response to emotional stimuli in several psychiatric conditions may be compared .

12843409|A converging body of literature over the last 50 years has implicated the amygdala in assigning emotional significance or value to sensory information .

12832558|These results demonstrate that early adverse emotional experience alters aminergic function within the hippocampus and amygdala and that the mother 's voice , a powerful emotional signal , can modulate these effects in the developing limbic system .

12832555|The dorsal amygdalas showed a temporal gradient similar to the right hippocampus , but emotional valence and intensity were not directly associated with changes in activity .

12821105|Lateralized impairment of the emotional enhancement of verbal memory in patients with amygdala-hippocampus lesion . .

12821105|This study investigated amygdala-hippocampus 's functional asymmetry in the emotional modulation of memory for stories .

12821105|This illustrates that the right amygdala can influence retention of complex emotional stimuli with verbal and pictorial arousing properties .

12821105|We concluded that an intact left amygdala-hippocampus is important for enhancement of memory related to emotionally arousing verbal material .

12812839|The amygdala including the lateral -LRB- La -RRB- , basolateral -LRB- BL -RRB- and central -LRB- Ce -RRB- nuclei is thought to play a key role in emotional responses .

12812839|These results suggest that distinct amygdaloid nuclei are activated by chemical somatic and visceral noxious stimuli , which might differentially contribute to emotional responses by them .

12805102|Twelve patients with focal , stable bilateral lesions of the VM cortex or with right unilateral lesions of the amygdala or the right insular cortices , were tested on the Emotional Quotient Inventory -LRB- EQ-i -RRB- , a standardized psychometric measure of various aspects of emotional and social intelligence .

12788335|When certain pathological emotional states are present , cortisol may have a role in differential activation of brain regions , particularly suppression of hippocampal activation , enhancement of amygdala activity , and dendritic reshaping in these regions as well as in the ventral prefrontal cortex .

12784931|In condition eliciting negative emotions we also detected activation of occipito-temporal regions and additionally activation of bilateral anterior insulae , right amygdala and right superior temporal gyrus .

12767481|Although the ACC appears to be involved in the central processing of emotional behavior in some way , the role was suggested to be entirely different from that of the amygdala .

12757901|Bilateral damage to the human amygdala impairs recognition of negatively valenced emotions from facial expressions , but it is unclear if this finding generalizes to richer visual stimuli that contain cues in addition to faces .

12757901|While control subjects were more accurate in recognizing emotions when facial expressions were present , subjects with bilateral amygdala damage did not show the same benefit for negative emotions , often performing equivalently across the two conditions .

12757901|Bilateral amygdala damage thus disproportionately impairs recognition of certain emotions from complex visual stimuli when subjects utilize information from facial expressions .

12742672|Prior neuroimaging studies of the amygdala in humans to date have focused principally on responses to emotional stimuli , primarily aversive , rather than to novelty per se .

12738003|The results show that amygdala activation by emotionally meaningful sounds like laughing and crying is independent of the emotional involvement , suggesting the pattern recognition aspect of these sounds is crucial for this activation .

12724182|Relationships between amygdala volume and activity during emotional information processing tasks in depressed and never-depressed individuals : an fMRI investigation . .

12724175|Taken together with converging evidence from neuroendocrine , lesion analysis , and postmortem studies of clinically depressed subjects , these data suggest that emotional/stress-response systems that include the amygdala are pathologically activated in major depression and that this activity is associated with dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex and monoamine neurotransmitter systems that normally modulate such responses .

12724174|Further studies are required , however , to elucidate the specific role of the cholinergic deficit in the amygdala in the emotional and behavioral symptoms in AD .

12724171|Perhaps the amygdala is equivalent to the hippocampus with regard to emotions , that is , necessary for acquiring new emotional attributes -LRB- anterograde emotions -RRB- , but not for retrieving old emotional attributes -LRB- retrograde emotions -RRB- .

12724171|Given the numerous lesion and functional neuroimaging studies illustrating the involvement of the amygdala in complex cognitive and behavioral functions , including '' social cognition , '' we suggest that this involvement is a manifestation of a more fundamental function mediated by the amygdala , which is to couple stimuli/entities with their emotional attributes , that is , the processing of somatic states from primary inducers .

12724169|Whether the amygdala is involved predominantly in emotional perception or in the generation of emotional states has been debated .

12724168|A number of studies in humans and other animals has confirmed the amygdala 's role in modulating cognition and behavior on the basis of a stimulus ' motivational , emotional , and social attributes .

12724167|The amygdala is implicated in a number of emotional responses including conditioned fear and anxiety , and it appears to regulate the behavioral and autonomic responses associated with such emotional responses .

12724165|Recent findings strongly suggest that the influence of emotional arousal on memory consolidation is mediated by the release of adrenal stress hormones -LRB- epinephrine and glucocorticoids -RRB- and neurotransmitters that converge in modulating the noradrenergic system within the amygdala .

12724164|Conditioning procedures potentiate inputs to the amygdala , which facilitate emotional responses via subcortical and cortical outputs .

12724162|Appetitive behavior : impact of amygdala-dependent mechanisms of emotional learning . .

12724162|In many circumstances , then , emotional behavior can be seen as a coordinated combination of processing by these amygdaloid sub-nuclei , reflecting the superimposition of a phylogenetically recent basolateral amygdala subsystem that encodes and retrieves the affective value of environmental stimuli and thereby directs complex , adaptive behavioral responses onto a phylogenetically older central amygdala subsystem that enables cortical structures -LRB- including the basolateral amygdala -RRB- to recruit incentive motivational processes and thereby invigorate emotional responding .

12724157|Both the hemispheric involvement of the human amygdala in memory for emotionally arousing events and the impairing effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on memory for emotional events exhibit pronounced sex-related differences .

12724155|These findings suggest that L-type calcium channels play a role in the amygdala in cued fear conditioning and have important implications in the treatment of anxiety and in emotional learning and plasticity .

12724152|Although it is generally agreed that the amygdala is involved in several forms of emotional learning and memory such as pavlovian fear conditioning , a recent debate has emerged concerning the precise role of the amygdala in learning versus performing fear responses .

12724147|-LRB- 2 -RRB- A set of projections extends from the amygdala to the hypothalamus and brain stem , which appears to modulate visceral function in relation to emotional stimuli .

12724147|-LRB- 3 -RRB- A forebrain circuit involves the amygdala with the ventromedial frontal , rostral insular , and rostral temporal cortical areas , the medial thalamus and ventromedial basal ganglia , and seems to be directly involved in emotional behavior and mood .

12682281|Within this network , there was greater activity during imitation , compared with observation of emotions , in premotor areas including the inferior frontal cortex , as well as in the superior temporal cortex , insula , and amygdala .

12694893|Borderline personality disorder -LRB- BPD -RRB- is a common disorder associated with emotional dysregulation and other symptoms that have been hypothesized to be related to dysfunction of limbic brain areas including hippocampus and amygdala .

12679470|The amygdala is important in the processing of emotion and generation of fear , whereas the hippocampus plays an important role in memory .

12671217|PURPOSE : Amygdala plays a very important role in the mediation of emotional and affective components of pain .

12668225|It is argued that while an initial detection of emotionally relevant events mediated by the amygdala may occur pre-attentively , subsequent stages of emotional processing require focal spatial attention .

12667843|Recent studies of amygdala function have focused on examining responses to emotionally valenced versus neutral stimuli .

12655318|Extended amygdala and emotional salience : a PET activation study of positive and negative affect . .

12655318|Functional neuroimaging studies have implicated amygdaloid and basal forebrain regions , including sublenticular extended amygdala -LRB- SLEA -RRB- , in the mediation of aversive emotional responses .

12655318|These findings demonstrate that both positive and negative emotional content evokes processing in the sublenticular/extended amygdala region , suggesting that this region is involved in general emotional processing , such as detection or attribution of salience .

12654340|alpha -LRB- 2C -RRB- - AR are thus present in brain regions involved in the processing of sensory information and in the control of motor and emotion-related activities such as the accumbens and caudate putamen nuclei , the olfactory tubercle , the lateral septum , the hippocampus , the amygdala , and the frontal and somatosensory cortices .

12644354|A recent functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- study demonstrated that the engagement of the right prefrontal cortex during the cognitive evaluation of angry and fearful facial expressions is associated with an attenuation of the response of the amygdala to these same stimuli , providing evidence for a functional neural network for emotional regulation .

12644354|The current results further implicate the importance of neocortical regions , including the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices , in regulating emotional responses mediated by the amygdala through conscious evaluation and appraisal .

12631528|The amygdala is intimately involved in encoding of emotions , especially those related to fear .

12631528|In addition , since the amygdala has been associated with the processing of facial expressions of emotion , particularly those of fear , the present data furthermore suggest that previous detoxifications may be related to changes within the amygdala .

12611981|The perirhinal cortex also interconnects with the amygdala , which plays an important role in various motivational and emotional behaviors .

12611981|Our observations suggest that a functional neural basis for the association of higher-order sensory inputs and emotion-related inputs exists in the perirhinal cortex and that transfer of sensory information to the entorhinal-hippocampal circuitry might be affected by the association of that information with incoming information from the amygdala .

12574449|The amygdala plays a key role in emotionality and has been shown to undergo neuroplastic changes in models of affective disorders .

12573516|The extended amygdala , a morphological and functional entity within the basal forebrain , is a neuronal substrate for emotional states like fear and anxiety .

12559833|There is a strong consensus that the amygdala is involved in mediating influences of emotional arousal and stress on learning and memory .

12559653|Activation of the medial prefrontal cortex and extended amygdala by individual ratings of emotional arousal : a fMRI study . .

12559653|We investigated whether incorporating individual ratings of emotional arousal in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- data improves the detection of activation in the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- MPFC -RRB- and sublenticular extended amygdala -LRB- SLEA -RRB- , areas implicated in the processing of emotional salience .

12559167|Previous studies carried out in the macaque monkey found that lesions of the amygdala not only decrease emotional reactivity but also disrupt normal social interactions .

12553413|Previous investigations of both adult human and non-human primates have indicated that primate social behavior and emotion are regulated by a complex neural network , in which the amygdala and orbital frontal cortex play major roles .

12553413|Therefore , this review will provide information generated from the study of macaque monkeys regarding the timing of normal social and emotional behavior development , the normal pattern of anatomical and functional maturation of the amygdala and orbital frontal cortex , as well as information regarding the neural and behavioral effects of early perturbations of these two neural structures .

12543449|We had the chance to evaluate emotional sweating in a 21-year-old female with bilateral restricted amygdala lesions caused by idiopathic subacute limbic encephalitis .

12543449|This indicates that the amygdala does play an important role in emotional sweating .

12531962|A case is reported of a patient who has bilateral amygdala damage and marked impairment in the perception of emotion , particularly fear .

12527026|Norepinephrine -LRB- NE -RRB- acts in the amygdala to regulate processes underlying acquisition and expression of emotional learning .

12527026|These findings suggest that vagal afferent stimulation may modify amygdalar processes of emotional learning via direct noradrenergic/adrenergic projections from the caudal medulla to the CeA .

12505650|The human amygdala and the emotional evaluation of sensory stimuli . .

12505650|A wealth of animal data implicates the amygdala in aspects of emotional processing .

12505650|Specific conclusions and hypotheses include : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the amygdala activates during exposure to aversive stimuli from multiple sensory modalities ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the amygdala responds to positively valenced stimuli , but these responses are less consistent than those induced by aversive stimuli ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- amygdala responses are modulated by the arousal level , hedonic strength or current motivational value of stimuli ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- amygdala responses are subject to rapid habituation ; -LRB- 5 -RRB- the temporal characteristics of amygdala responses vary across stimulus categories and subject populations ; -LRB- 6 -RRB- emotionally valenced stimuli need not reach conscious awareness to engage amygdala processing ; -LRB- 7 -RRB- conscious hedonic appraisals do not require amygdala activation ; -LRB- 8 -RRB- activation of the amygdala is associated with modulation of motor readiness , autonomic functions , and cognitive processes including attention and memory ; -LRB- 9 -RRB- amygdala activations do not conform to traditional models of the lateralization of emotion ; and -LRB- 10 -RRB- the extent and laterality of amygdala activations are related to factors including psychiatric status , gender and personality .

12498962|A direct comparison between emotion and age discrimination revealed that while younger adults activated the amygdala and surrounding temporo-limbic regions , older adults activated left frontal regions .

12495531|Impaired recognition of social emotions following amygdala damage . .

12495531|Lesion , functional imaging , and single-unit studies in human and nonhuman animals have demonstrated a role for the amygdala in processing stimuli with emotional and social significance .

12495531|To test the hypothesis that the recognition of social emotions depends on the amygdala , we administered the same stimuli to 30 subjects with unilateral amygdala damage -LRB- 16 left , 14 right -RRB- , 2 with bilateral amygdala damage , 47 brain-damaged controls , and 19 normal controls .

12495531|Compared with controls , subjects with unilateral or bilateral amygdala damage were impaired when recognizing social emotions ; moreover , they were more impaired in recognition of social emotions than in recognition of basic emotions , and , like previously described patients with autism , they were impaired also when asked to recognize social emotions from the eye region of the face alone .

12482682|On the basis of recent evidence indicating a sex-related lateralization of amygdala function in memory for emotional events , together with substantial evidence suggesting hemispheric specialization in processing global -LRB- central -RRB- versus local -LRB- detail -RRB- aspects of a situation , and the established dependence of the amygdala 's memory modulating function on beta-adrenergic receptor activation , we predicted differential effects of a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist -LRB- propranolol -RRB- on long-term memory for an emotionally arousing story in men and women .

12482682|Additionally , they provide support for the hypothesis that , in this paradigm , emotional arousal enhances long-term memory for central information in men via activation of right amygdala/hemisphere function , and enhances long-term memory for peripheral details in women via activation of left amygdala/hemisphere function .

12482086|The amygdala response to emotional stimuli : a comparison of faces and scenes . .

12453496|Pathways for emotion : interactions of prefrontal and anterior temporal pathways in the amygdala of the rhesus monkey . .

12453496|The amygdala has been implicated in processing information about the emotional significance of the environment and in the expression of emotions , through robust pathways with prefrontal , anterior temporal areas , and central autonomic structures .

12453496|Moreover , medial prefrontal axonal terminations were expansive , spreading into the parvicellular basolateral nucleus , which is robustly connected with hypothalamic autonomic structures , suggesting that they may influence the expressive emotional system of the amygdala .

12451144|This report describes a projection from the amygdala , a forebrain center mediating emotional expression , to the inferior colliculus -LRB- IC -RRB- , the midbrain integration center of the ascending auditory system .

12450947|The increase was greater in the amygdala and hippocampus during the emotional valence discrimination task than during the age discrimination task .

12450947|Contrasting patients and comparison subjects on the emotional valence discrimination task revealed voxels in the left amygdala and bilateral hippocampus in which the comparison subjects had significantly greater activation .

12443984|This study analyzes the impact of environmental complexity in adult rats on their emotional behavior and c-Fos expression -LRB- a transcription factor protein implicated in neuronal plasticity -RRB- in various subdivisions of amygdala , as well as selected parts of the thalamus and hypothalamus .

12443984|We found that this long-term environmental manipulation exerts significant effects on animals ' emotionality and this behavioral difference is accompanied by the differential c-Fos activation -LRB- at 2 h after the aversive training -RRB- in the amygdala , a brain structure believed to subserve emotional reactions .

12433381|Our results revealed that , contrary to the prevailing view , all brain regions responding differentially to emotional faces , including the amygdala , did so only when sufficient attentional resources were available to process the faces .

12427848|Basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- activation by emotional arousal modulates memory-related processes in the hippocampus .

12418936|Given the established role of the amygdala as part of a distributed neural system for the processing of emotional cues , we hypothesized that subjects with GSP would exhibit greater amygdala activation in response to harsh -LRB- angry , fearful , and contemptous -RRB- vs accepting -LRB- happy -RRB- facial emotional expressions compared with healthy control subjects -LRB- HCs -RRB- .

12417674|Electrophysiological responses in the human amygdala discriminate emotion categories of complex visual stimuli . .

12417674|The human amygdala has been shown to participate in processing emotionally salient stimuli related to threat , danger , and aversion , data that have come primarily from functional imaging and lesion studies .

12417674|The observed responses in the gamma frequency range may reflect the role of the amygdala in binding perceptual representations of the stimuli with memory , emotional response , and modulation of ongoing cognition , on the basis of the emotional significance of the stimuli .

12405982|These findings indicate that the degree of activation of the noradrenergic system within the amygdala in response to a novel , emotionally arousing experience predicts the extent of long-term memory for that experience .

12397873|The functional images of the human amygdala demonstrate or implicate this limbic structure in the processes of reward learning and memory , conditioned reward and emotion dysregulation related to drug use , and the transition to addiction .

12395114|Utilizing a random effects model and hypothesis-driven analytic strategy , it was observed that each of the four emotional faces was associated with reliable bilateral activation of the amygdala compared with neutral .

12395114|These findings suggest a broader role for the amygdala in modulating the vigilance level during the perception of several negative and positive facial emotions .

12389177|Recently , it has been reported that the consolidation of the hippocampal LTP may be modulated , like memory , by the emotional state and by the activation of the basolateral amygdala .

12388617|In the present study , we explored both the neural basis of abnormal emotional behavior in PD and the physiological effects of dopaminergic therapy on the response of the amygdala , a central structure in emotion processing .

12388617|Our results demonstrate an abnormal amygdala response in PD that may underlie the emotional deficits accompanying the disease .

12373778|The posterior basolateral nucleus of the amygdala is known to mediate fear and anxiety and is important in assigning emotional valence to cognitive processes .

12373741|The descending pathway between the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- and the dorsal vagal complex -LRB- DVC -RRB- is an important substrate for autonomic functions associated with emotion .

12372665|Here we show amounts of dopaminergic proteins in the amygdala , a key brain structure involved in the integration of emotions and stress , in subjects with major depression and in psychiatrically normal control subjects .

12369802|Moreover , compared with fear conditioning results , they suggest that expression of amygdalar plasticity in PS depends on the emotional salience of the stimulus .

12361846|We examined the actions of estrogen on excitatory synaptic transmission in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , a brain region involved in learning , emotions , and the effects of stress .

20957557|LJM , a 41-year-old schizophrenic Chinese man with bilateral anterior cingulate gyrus -LRB- Brodmann 's area 24 -RRB- lesions and also a small lesion in right amygdala after an operation , was compared with normal as well as brain-damaged and schizophrenic controls in identification of morphed facial expressions of six basic emotions .

20957557|The dissociation between recognition of fear and other emotions supported the view that the brain has separable networks for processing different emotions , and that the right amygdala as well as the anterior part of bilateral cingulate gyrus are possible substrates involved in the special network for perception of fear .

12244085|Patients with the temporal variant of FTD -LRB- tvFTD -RRB- are particularly at risk for developing deficits in emotional processing secondary to atrophy in the amygdala , anterior temporal cortex -LRB- ATC -RRB- and orbital frontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- , structures that are components of the brain 's emotional processing systems .

12244085|We examined one aspect of emotional processing , namely the comprehension of facial expressions of emotion -LRB- emotional comprehension -RRB- in nine individuals with tvFTD , and correlated performance on this measure with atrophy -LRB- as measured from T -LRB- 1 -RRB- - weighted MRI scans by region of interest analysis -RRB- in the amygdala , ATC and OFC .

12244085|Thus , emotional comprehension appeared to be most impaired when bilateral amygdala atrophy was present , and was not associated with the degree of left amygdala atrophy .

12210136|These topographically organized pathways also provide a route by means of which the claustrum and the endopiriform nucleus have access to inputs from the amygdaloid networks that process emotionally significant information .

12208011|These results demonstrate that amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex can be activated by emotional stimuli even without awareness after parietal damage ; and that substantial unconscious residual processing can occur within spared brain areas well beyond visual cortex , despite neglect and extinction .

12201036|The obtained results are discussed in the light of LeDoux 's and Kapp 's findings showing crucial role of amygdala in processing of emotionally relevant stimulation and it 's involvement in initiating autonomic responses .

12191458|Modulation of amygdalar activity by the conscious regulation of negative emotion . .

12191458|Lesion and neuroimaging studies suggest the amygdala is important in the perception and production of negative emotion ; however , the effects of emotion regulation on the amygdalar response to negative stimuli remain unknown .

12191458|Using event-related fMRI , we tested the hypothesis that voluntary modulation of negative emotion is associated with changes in neural activity within the amygdala .

12191458|However , a prolonged increase in signal change was observed in the amygdala when subjects maintained the negative emotional response during the delay following negative picture offset .

12191458|This increase in amygdalar signal due to the active maintenance of negative emotion was significantly correlated with subjects ' self-reported dispositional levels of negative affect .

12191458|These results suggest that consciously evoked cognitive mechanisms that alter the emotional response of the subject operate , at least in part , by altering the degree of neural activity within the amygdala .

12187363|The amygdala , a key brain structure associated with emotional responses , is thought to be a target of tachykinin receptor antagonists for exerting psychopharmacological actions .

12177452|Novel distracters activated inferior frontal gyrus , amygdala , and fusiform gyrus , with significantly stronger activation evoked by the emotional scenes .

12177449|Contrary to the prevailing view , all brain regions responding differentially to emotional faces , including the amygdala , did so only when sufficient attentional resources were available to process the faces .

12169253|In contrast , judgment of emotionally evocative , but non-moral statements activated the left amygdala , lingual gyri , and the lateral orbital gyrus .

12169250|Some functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- studies have reported increased amygdala response during exposure to emotional stimuli while others have not shown such activation .

12169250|The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that activation of the amygdala is related to the relevance of the emotional valence of stimuli .

12169250|These results support the central role of the amygdala in emotion processing , and indicate its sensitivity to the task relevance of the emotional display .

12167256|Is the human amygdala critical for the subjective experience of emotion ?

12167256|It is thought that the human amygdala is a critical component of the neural substrates of emotional experience , involved particularly in the generation of fear , anxiety , and general negative affectivity .

12167256|Although many neuroimaging studies demonstrate findings consistent this notion , little evidence of altered emotional experience following amygdala damage has been gathered in humans .

12165379|Human lesion or neuroimaging studies suggest that amygdala is involved in facial emotion recognition .

12165379|Exaggerated amygdala activation during emotional intensity judgment found in the schizophrenic patients may reflect impaired gating of sensory input containing emotion .

12154148|It is argued that the amygdala is the locus of consolidation of the core of the traumatic experience and that amygdalar inhibition of hippocampal function at high levels of emotional arousal mediates diminution of conscious memory for peritraumatic events .

12151561|These findings raise the possibility that certain forms of chronic stress , by affecting specific neuronal elements in the amygdala , may lead to behavioral manifestations of enhanced emotionality .

12151279|Replicated localised functional changes include increased activation of the amygdala after symptom provocation -LRB- which may reflect its role in emotional memory -RRB- and decreased activity of Broca 's area at the same time -LRB- which may explain the difficulty patients have in labelling their experiences -RRB- .

12150768|Synaptic plasticity in the amygdala appears to be necessary for the generation of emotional memories .

12150768|PSA-NCAM expression in the lateral amygdala could indicate its participation in the plastic events that lead to the generation of emotional memories such as those related to fear conditioning .

12134284|The role played by the amygdala in the automatic evaluation of danger is considered a basic model for eliciting emotional responses .

12130784|These results demonstrate genetically driven variation in the response of brain regions underlying human emotional behavior and suggest that differential excitability of the amygdala to emotional stimuli may contribute to the increased fear and anxiety typically associated with the short SLC6A4 allele .

12126877|Although the precise mechanisms are not clear , and the involvement of noradrenergic systems can not be precluded , data are consistent with the idea that dopamine , released in response to a stressful experience for example , interacts with CRH and neurotensin in the extended amygdala to affect emotional responsiveness .

12113915|Neurobiological studies have shown that the noradrenergic stress-system is involved in enhanced encoding of emotional memories , sensitization , and fear conditioning , by way of its effects on the amygdala .

12110364|Via these widespread projections , the amygdala facilitates consolidation of emotionally arousing memories .

12110364|Recent work indicates that amygdala neurons show theta activity during emotional arousal , and various types of oscillations during sleep .

12105126|This study aimed to evaluate the effects of neonatal exposure to cocaine on the levels of neurotransmitters in the amygdala of developing rats and to relate these levels with open-field observations , mainly rearing behavior , that is regarded to reflect emotional components .

12099486|The dissociation with reduced activity in the left amygdala and the right parahippocampal gyrus may suggest that aging differentially affects neural responses to faces with negative or positive emotional valence .

12098654|Our observations suggest that changes of GABAergic transmission may be involved in retrieval and expression of conditioned fear and the modulation of emotional state through the amygdala .

12094212|The amygdala -- an almond-shaped group of nuclei at the heart of the telencephalon -- has been associated with a range of cognitive functions , including emotion , learning , memory , attention and perception .

12094212|Most current views of amygdala function emphasize its role in negative emotions , such as fear , and in linking negative emotions with other aspects of cognition , such as learning and memory .

12094212|However , recent evidence supports a role for the amygdala in processing positive emotions as well as negative ones , including learning about the beneficial biological value of stimuli .

12046982|The amygdala is known to be involved in the expression of emotion such as anxiety and fear , and several studies have shown that the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- is involved in morphine dependence .

12044453|The amygdala plays an important role in the interpretation of emotionally significant stimuli and has strong projections to brainstem regions regulating muscle tone and sleep .

12030820|Our review yielded the following summary observations : -LRB- 1 -RRB- The medial prefrontal cortex had a general role in emotional processing ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- fear specifically engaged the amygdala ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- sadness was associated with activity in the subcallosal cingulate ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- emotional induction by visual stimuli activated the occipital cortex and the amygdala ; -LRB- 5 -RRB- induction by emotional recall/imagery recruited the anterior cingulate and insula ; -LRB- 6 -RRB- emotional tasks with cognitive demand also involved the anterior cingulate and insula .

12028364|The amygdala plays an important role in emotional learning .

12028364|Synaptic plasticity underlying the acquisition of conditioned fear occurs in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala : long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- of synapses in the pathway of the conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- has shown to be a neural correlate of this kind of emotional learning .

12015602|The lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LAT -RRB- is necessary for the emotional memory formation in this paradigm .

12015233|Recognition of emotion draws on a distributed set of structures that include the occipitotemporal neocortex , amygdala , orbitofrontal cortex and right frontoparietal cortices .

11997687|Enhanced amygdala responses to emotional versus neutral schematic facial expressions . .

11997687|Significantly increased fMRI signal was found in the amygdala , hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in response to emotional vs neutral schematic faces .

11991764|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is extensively implicated in emotional learning and memory .

11983183|Ca n't shake that feeling : event-related fMRI assessment of sustained amygdala activity in response to emotional information in depressed individuals . .

11983183|A computational neural network model of emotional information processing suggests this process involves sustained amygdala activity in response to processing negative features of information .

11983183|During emotional processing trials , never-depressed individuals displayed amygdalar responses to all stimuli , which decayed within 10 sec .

11982631|The purpose of this study was to investigate amygdala-related fear and anxiety in two inbred rat lines differing in emotionality -LRB- RHA/Verh and RLA/Verh -RRB- , and to relate the behaviour of the animals to neuronal types in different nuclei of the amygdala .

11978842|In addition , withdrawal increased beta-gal expression in the continuum of the extended amygdala and nucleus accumbens , macrostructures associated with the coupling of emotional stimuli to motor and autonomic responses .

11977337|In recent years , with the use of neuroimaging techniques , an important role of posterior temporal cortex , orbital-frontal cortex , amygdaloid nucleus and insula in the regulation of emotional behaviour has been indicated .

11976395|Studies have revealed that the amygdala formation is involved in emotional learning , attention , and autonomic functions .

11970870|Auditory information critical for fear conditioning , a model of emotional learning , is conveyed to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala via two routes : directly from the medial geniculate nucleus and indirectly from the auditory cortex .

11958868|The amygdala is a heterogeneous structure which has multiple nuclei involved in processing emotional information .

11933997|Ecstasy and agony : activation of the human amygdala in positive and negative emotion . .

11933997|Considerable evidence indicates that the amygdala plays a critical role in negative , aversive human emotions .

11933997|Although researchers have speculated that the amygdala plays a role in positive emotion , little relevant evidence exists .

11933997|We examined the neural correlates of positive and negative emotion using positron emission tomography -LRB- PET -RRB- , focusing on the amygdala .

11933997|The left amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex were activated during positive emotion , and bilateral amygdala activation occurred during negative emotion .

11933997|The current results constitute the first neuroimaging evidence for a role of the amygdala in positive emotional reactions elicited by visual stimuli .

11933997|Although the amygdala appears to play a more extensive role in negative emotion , it is involved in positive emotion as well .

11932937|Although calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II -LRB- CaMK -RRB- has been shown to play a critical role in long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- and emotional learning mediated by the basolateral amygdala , little is known about its cellular localization in this region .

11924897|However , an additional analysis restricted to the subcortical and limbic system structures revealed bilateral activation of the amygdala in both target emotions .

11924878|Positive and negative emotional verbal stimuli elicit activity in the left amygdala . .

11924878|The human amygdala 's involvement in negative emotion is well established , but relatively little is known regarding its role in positive emotion .

11924878|Relative to neutral words , positive and negative emotional words elicited greater activity in the left amygdala .

11924878|These findings provide the first direct evidence that the amygdala is involved in emotional reactions elicited by both positive and negative emotional words , and further indicate that positive words additionally activate brain regions related to reward .

11924875|Surgical stress activates the amygdala and secretion of norepinephrine , both involved in memory and unconscious processing of emotionally negative information .

26983968|In the functional magnetic resonance imaging study enhanced amygdala activation was found in BPD , and it is suggested to reflect the intense and slowly subsiding emotions commonly observed in response to even low-level stressors .

11923633|Clinical studies involving patients who had temporal lobectomy surgeries have also revealed changes in emotional learning related to the degree of amygdala involvement .

11923438|Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a passive visual task , we show that both basic and moral emotions activate the amygdala , thalamus , and upper midbrain .

11922997|In mammals , the pallial amygdala is implicated in emotional learning and memory , whereas the hippocampus is involved in spatial , contextual , or relational memory .

11912070|The purpose of the present study was to : -LRB- 1 -RRB- examine whether excessive alcohol-consuming rats have a diminished response to potential danger and an enhanced tendency to explore novel surroundings ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- investigate a possible relationship between the above-mentioned behavioural parameters and two of the emotional motor systems in the basal forebrain , i.e. the extended amygdala and the ventral striato-pallidal system .

11898990|Another possible suggestion is that higher brain weight in suicide victims may be related to previously demonstrated increased amygdala blood flow and subsequent amygdala enlargement due to the increased processing of emotional information .

11891634|The amygdala is likely the key node in the system that marks objects as emotionally salient and could be crucial to the development of cortical face specialization .

11877495|Much data indicate that the perirhinal -LRB- PRH -RRB- cortex plays a critical role in declarative memory and that the amygdala facilitates this process under emotionally arousing conditions .

11877495|In part , this mechanism might explain how the amygdala promotes memory storage in emotionally arousing conditions .

11870922|When compared to viewing emotionally neutral film excerpts , viewing erotic film excerpts was associated , for both genders , with bilateral blood oxygen level dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- signal increases in the anterior cingulate , medial prefrontal , orbitofrontal , insular , and occipitotemporal cortices , as well as in the amygdala and the ventral striatum .

11856971|We also present the four main projections from the latter area to the extended amygdala , the hypothalamus , the periaqueductal grey matter -LRB- PAG -RRB- , and the ventrolateral medulla -LRB- VLM -RRB- , and their involvement in emotional and autonomic -LRB- homeostatic -RRB- aspects of pain .

11833009|Specifically , we assume that classical conditioning leads to an intense emotional memory of the trauma that is mainly implicit and related to plastic changes in subcortical structures such as the amygdala .

11803449|The expression of the prodynorphin mRNA was currently studied in the amygdaloid complex , a brain region critical for emotional processing , in subjects -LRB- 14-15 per group -RRB- diagnosed with major depression , bipolar disorder , or schizophrenia and compared to normal controls .

11801232|This article reviews the modern literature on two key aspects of the central circuitry of emotion : the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- and the amygdala .

11801227|The amygdala has long been implicated in the mediation of emotional and social behaviors .

11798440|We speculated that emotionally arousing autobiographical memories may be qualitatively different from everyday memories and may involve the amygdala .

11790378|Behavior during conditioned fear stress , a form of psychological stress , and the release of dopamine in the amygdala were measured over time using methamphetamine-sensitized rats , which are considered to be a model of hypersensitivity and vulnerability to emotional stress associated with stimulant-induced psychosis and schizophrenia .

11790378|The above results suggested that delayed dopamine release in the amygdala is a phenomenon strongly associated with the emotional context of conditioned fear stress , and hypersensitivity and vulnerability to stress are at least partially involved with the overreaction to stress .

11784733|Pain has a strong emotional dimension , and the amygdala plays a key role in emotionality .

11784442|Some involvement of the human amygdala in the processing of facial expressions has been investigated in neuroimaging studies , although the neural mechanisms underlying motivated or emotional behavior in response to facial stimuli are not yet fully understood .

11784442|We investigated , using functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- and healthy volunteers , how the amygdala interacts with other cortical regions while subjects are judging the sex of faces with negative , positive , or neutral emotion .

11773432|Verbal and nonverbal emotional memory following unilateral amygdala damage . .

11773432|The amygdala is involved in the normal facilitation of memory by emotion , but the separate contributions of the left and right amygdala to memory for verbal or nonverbal emotional material have not been investigated .

11773432|Fourteen patients with damage to the medial temporal lobe including the amygdala -LRB- seven left , seven right -RRB- , 18 brain-damaged , and 36 normal controls were exposed to emotional and neutral pictures accompanied by verbal narratives .

11773432|Subjects with left amygdala damage failed to show the normally robust enhancement of memory for verbal and nonverbal emotional stimuli .

11773432|The group with right amygdala damage showed the normal pattern of facilitation of memory by emotion for both verbal and nonverbal stimuli despite an overall reduction in memory performance .

11773432|Furthermore , subjects with left amygdala damage were disproportionately impaired on memory for emotional narratives as compared with memory for emotional pictures .

11773432|The latter finding offers partial support for a lateralized and material-specific pattern of the amygdala 's contribution to emotional memory .

11752838|In summary , studies in experimental animals suggest that stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity is centrally mediated by endogenous CRF and involvement of structures of the emotional motor system , e.g. the amygdala .

11695953|Studies with healthy adults and children , as well as with adults who have amygdala lesions , have found facial expressions of emotion to be useful probes of amygdala activity .

11695953|We hypothesized that children with anxiety and depression may show atypical amygdala responses to emotional stimuli .

11741029|The amygdala exerts a general modulatory influence on memory storage processes related , in part , to an organism 's level of affective or emotional arousal .

11741029|Moreover , affective state can influence the use of different memory systems , and the amygdala may mediate this effect of emotion on memory .

11741029|Recent human brain imaging studies also point to both sex - and hemisphere-related asymmetries in amygdala participation in emotionally influenced memory .

11738126|A similar effect can be obtained by stimulating the basolateral amygdala , a limbic structure related to emotions .

11730710|Kindling of the amygdaloid complex in rats results in an enhanced emotionality frequently expressed by an elevated anxiety and defensive attitude toward other animals .

11727218|Thus , the amygdala complex , a structure related to processes of memory and emotional control , is severely affected in this disease from the initial stages .

11727217|The amygdaloid body is a structure localized to the temporal lobe in mammals , formed by different nuclei and traditionally associated with the emotion system of the brain .

11727217|The relation of the amygdaloid body with the emotions has been based on the study of the conditioning of fear , by which an emotionally neutral stimulus can cause emotional reactions due to its temporal association with an adverse stimulus .

11727217|It has been shown that the amygdaloid body is necessary for learning and expressing this conditioning , and is therefore involved in emotional learning .

22033605|In contrast to hallucinogens , the entactogen MDMA produces an emotional state of positive mood , concomitant with an activation of prefrontolimbiclparalimbic structures and a deactivation of amygdala and thalamus .

11719213|Feeling or features : different sensitivity to emotion in high-order visual cortex and amygdala . .

11716820|The neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie such changes are not yet fully understood , however , there is evidence that the amygdala plays an essential role in behavioral and emotional responses to a variety of stressors .

11704071|Increased amygdala response to masked emotional faces in depressed subjects resolves with antidepressant treatment : an fMRI study . .

11704071|The amygdala has a central role in processing emotions , particularly fear .

11704071|During functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- amygdala activation has been demonstrated outside of conscious awareness using masked emotional faces .

11704071|We applied the masked faces paradigm to patients with major depression -LRB- n = 11 -RRB- and matched control subjects -LRB- n = 11 -RRB- during fMRI to compare amygdala activation in response to masked emotional faces before and after antidepressant treatment .

11682152|The amygdala has been implicated in the mediation of emotional and species-specific social behavior -LRB- Kling et al. , 1970 ; Kling and Brothers , 1992 ; Kluver and Bucy , 1939 ; Rosvold et al. , 1954 -RRB- .

11682152|Humans with bilateral amygdala damage are impaired in judging negative emotion in facial expressions and making accurate judgements of trustworthiness -LRB- Adolphs et al. , 1998 , 1994 -RRB- .

11596777|The brain structures identified as critically involved in these different components and levels of emotions are : the amygdala , considered as the structure where the external stimuli are appraised in terms of their emotional significance ; the insular cortex and the hypothalamus , crucially involved in the generation of the autonomic components of emotions ; the ventral striatum , which subserves the execution of stereotyped emotional action patterns and the ventro-medial frontal cortex , playing a critical role in functions of control and inhibition of socially unacceptable emotional responses .

11596049|Heavily labeled P450AROM mRNA-containing cells were found in the accessory basal amygdala nucleus , which projects to the cingulate cortex and hippocampus , areas that are important in the expression of emotional behaviors and memory processing .

11590116|The projections from the amygdaloid complex to the hippocampus and surrounding cortex have a critical role in the formation of memories for emotionally arousing stimuli and in the spread of epileptic seizures .

11588195|The amygdaloid complex is a prominent temporal lobe region that is associated with '' emotional '' information processing .

11588195|Studies in the rodent have also recently implicated the amygdala in the processing and modulation of pain sensation , the experience of which involves a considerable emotional component in humans .

11587889|The amygdala results seem to be in accordance with the right-hemisphere hypothesis of emotion processing which may not be applicable as strongly to the level of auditory cortex or insula .

11573015|As intensity of these chills increased , cerebral blood flow increases and decreases were observed in brain regions thought to be involved in reward/motivation , emotion , and arousal , including ventral striatum , midbrain , amygdala , orbitofrontal cortex , and ventral medial prefrontal cortex .

11568425|Evidence for a differential involvement of the human left and right amygdala in emotional and cognitive behaviour is reviewed , with a particular emphasis on functional imaging results and case reports on patients with amygdalar damage .

11548604|Preliminary Semax injection decreased the stress-induced c-Fos expression in the paraventricular hypothalamus and medial septum in rats predisposed to emotional stress and tended to reduce the number of stress-induced c-Fos-immunopositive cells in the lateral septum and basolateral amygdala in both groups of animals .

11522965|To determine whether the amygdala 's role in affective processing extends beyond negative stimuli , subjects viewed pictures that varied in emotional content -LRB- positive vs negative valence -RRB- and arousal level -LRB- high vs low -RRB- while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging .

11522965|These results clearly demonstrate a role for the amygdala in processing emotional stimuli that extends beyond negative and fearful stimuli .

11522264|Enhanced amygdala activation in BPD is suggested to reflect the intense and slowly subsiding emotions commonly observed in response to even low-level stressors .

11522264|Borderline subjects ' perceptual cortex may be modulated through the amygdala leading to increased attention to emotionally relevant environmental stimuli .

11520704|Across studies , the amygdala has been consistently implicated as playing a key role in enhancing explicit memory for both pleasant and unpleasant emotional stimuli through modulation of encoding and consolidation processes .

11516835|Notably , these medullary lesions also suppressed neuronal responses in the medial amygdala , an area that is now considered critical to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis responses to emotional stressors and that is also known to display a significant increase in noradrenaline turnover during restraint .

11516835|We conclude that medullary neurones influence corticotropin-releasing factor cell responses to emotional stressors via a multisynaptic pathway that may involve a noradrenergic input to the medial amygdala .

11516444|Recognition of words presented in emotionally negative relative to emotionally neutral contexts was associated with enhanced activity in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , left amygdala and hippocampus , right lingual gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex .

11514030|The present study further shows that : -LRB- 1 -RRB- The EA depressor effect is strong enough to surpass the pressor response of the AC -LRB- nucleus amygdaloideus centralis -RRB- - emotional circuit , -LRB- 2 -RRB- both beta-endorphin -LRB- beta-EP -RRB- and GABA in the RVL mediate the EA antagonistic effect , -LRB- 3 -RRB- the EA effect does not take place in the AC and paraventricular nucleus -LRB- two key nuclei besides the RVL , which also have beta-EPergic input -RRB- in the emotional circuit .

11499994|Consistent with some prior studies , these findings support a role for the right anteromedial temporal lobe -LRB- including amygdala -RRB- in recognizing emotion from faces but caution in drawing conclusions from small group samples .

11495097|Functional neuroimaging symptom provocation and cognitive activation paradigms using PET measurement of regional cerebral blood flow have revealed greater activation of the amygdala and anterior paralimbic structures -LRB- which are known to be involved in processing negative emotions such as fear -RRB- , greater deactivation of Broca 's region -LRB- motor speech -RRB- and other nonlimbic cortical regions , and failure of activation of the cingulate cortex -LRB- which possibly plays an inhibitory role -RRB- in response to trauma-related stimuli in individuals with PTSD .

11494576|Disorders of the amygdaloid-hippocampal region and cerebellum are considered to play an important role in the characteristic cognitive and emotional dysfunction in autism .

11493699|By using event-related functional MRI , that crossed sensory modality -LRB- visual or auditory -RRB- with emotional expression -LRB- fearful or happy -RRB- , we show that perceptual facilitation during face fear processing is expressed through modulation of neuronal responses in the amygdala and the fusiform cortex .

11493699|These data suggest that the amygdala is important for emotional crossmodal sensory convergence with the associated perceptual bias during fear processing , being mediated by task-related modulation of face-processing regions of fusiform cortex .

11483244|PAC1 shows strong expression in brain areas which have been implicated in the emotional control of behavior , such as the amygdala , the hypothalamus , the locus coeruleus and the periaqueductal gray .

11473792|The present study applied a visual half field paradigm with emotional facial expressions in patients with selective unilateral amygdalo-hippocampectomy -LRB- AHE -RRB- to elucidate the contributions of the left and right medial temporal lobe and amygdala to emotional learning .

11467919|Right neostriatum and left amygdala were activated when subjects made explicit judgements of disgust , bilateral orbitofrontal cortex when they made judgement of happiness , and right frontal and insular cortex when they made judgements about any emotion .

11457592|Fos immunoreactivity in the medial , but not central or basolateral amygdala is a novel finding and draws attention to this subregion as a possible interface between olfactory input and emotional output .

11438354|These brain regions are all known to be involved in emotional behavior -LRB- anterior hypothalamus , medial nucleus of the amygdala , cingulate cortex -RRB- or autonomic regulation , respectively -LRB- solitary tract nucleus , dorsal motor nucleus of vagus -RRB- .

11438352|In contrast , limbic forebrain afferents including the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CNA -RRB- and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- , regions that coordinate emotional responses to external stressors , provide direct synaptic input to noradrenergic dendrites that extend into rostral dorsolateral peri-coerulear areas .

11431229|The presence of emotional aspects of craving is suggested by amygdala activation .

11430815|These results reveal differential influences on face processing from attention and emotion , with the amygdala response to threat-related expressions unaffected by a manipulation of attention that strongly modulates the fusiform response to faces .

11430468|Modulation of hippocampal long-term potentiation by the amygdala : a synaptic mechanism linking emotion and memory . .

11430468|Since the amygdala and hippocampus play pivotal roles in emotion and memory , respectively , the interaction between these brain regions may underlie the formation of enhanced memory for emotionally arousing events .

11430468|The activity-dependent facilitation of hippocampal LTP by the basomedial and basolateral amygdala may be a synaptic mechanism underlying memory enhancement associated with emotions .

11427332|Interacting with this system , emotionally arousing events enhance neural activity in the amygdala , which in turn may modulate processing in other brain regions responsible for declarative memory formation .

11425882|The amygdala is known to be a critical mediator of emotional learning in aversive and appetitive conditioning .

11423094|These findings suggest that the excitability of the projection system from the amygdala to the hypothalamus and midbrain , the main pathways of emotional expression , is enhanced in Fyn-deficient mice .

11417461|Embedded within contemporary views of emotional learning is a well-founded agreement that the amygdala plays a pivotal role in the formation and consolidation of aversive memories formed during fear conditioning .

11414274|The amygdala is the most notably involved brain structure in emotional responses and the formation of emotional memories .

11414274|In this review we describe a system , composed of the amygdala and the hippocampus , that acts synergistically to form long-term memories of significantly emotional events .

11414274|This dual activation of the amygdala and the hippocampus and the dynamics between them may be what gives emotionally based memories their uniqueness .

11409730|These results extend previous neuroimaging findings in healthy subjects indicating a role for the amygdala in transient negative emotional states , and suggest that this multimodal brain region also is involved in more durable negative affects such as dispositional pessimism .

11405424|The results are relevant to understanding the interaction between structures important in mood and emotion -LRB- such as the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex -RRB- and other brain areas involved in storing objects and faces -LRB- such as the inferior temporal visual cortex -RRB- and memories -LRB- such as the hippocampus -RRB- .

11392037|The limbic system , particularly the amygdala , plays a prominent role in regulating emotion and mood .

11331391|Considerable evidence suggests that the lateral -LRB- LA -RRB- and basal -LRB- BA -RRB- nuclei of the amygdala are sites of plasticity and storage of emotional memory .

11357132|Lesions of the human amygdala impair enhanced perception of emotionally salient events . .

11357132|Here we consider that a critical function of the human amygdala is to enhance the perception of stimuli that have emotional significance .

11353739|Differential extrageniculostriate and amygdala responses to presentation of emotional faces in a cortically blind field . .

11352615|Moreover , direct gaze led to greater correlation between activity in the fusiform and the amygdala , a region associated with emotional responses and stimulus saliency .

11349391|Noradrenergic processes within the amygdala have been implicated in the modulation of memory for emotional material .

11349391|The amygdala has also been associated with the processing of facial expressions of emotion , particularly those of fear and sadness .

11338176|While mechanisms of spatial attention are impaired after parietal damage in neglect patients , intact visual pathways to the ventral temporal lobe and amygdala might still mediate distinct mechanisms of emotional attention .

11320257|These results define a unique set of molecular markers for amygdaloid subnuclei and provide tools to genetically dissect their functional roles in different emotional behaviors .

11311883|Inhibition of amygdaloid dopamine D2 receptors impairs emotional learning measured with fear-potentiated startle . .

11311883|To assess the role of amygdaloid DA D -LRB- 2 -RRB- receptors in aversive emotionality , the D -LRB- 2 -RRB- receptor antagonist raclopride was infused into the amygdala prior to Pavlovian fear conditioning .

11311883|These findings further refine the known neural mechanisms of amygdala-based emotional learning and memory and were interpreted to suggest that , along with D -LRB- 1 -RRB- receptors , D -LRB- 2 -RRB- receptors in the amygdala may mediate the formation and the retention of newly-acquired fear associations .

11301245|Cortical regions in the temporal lobe participate in perceiving socially relevant stimuli , whereas the amygdala , right somatosensory cortices , orbitofrontal cortices , and cingulate cortices all participate in linking perception of such stimuli to motivation , emotion , and cognition .

11301196|Already at the age of eight days the precentral medial cortex , anterior cingulate cortex and the lateral thalamus could be identified by their enhanced metabolic activation in response to the presentation of the emotionally relevant maternal nursing calls , whereas other brain areas , such as the hippocampus and amygdala did not show stimulus-induced activation .

11287374|The unexpected finding of increased involvement of the amygdala suggests that the patients may have processed the emotional content of the faces to a greater degree than did the controls .

11287374|Furthermore , the positive association between amygdala activity and memory performance in the patients suggests a possible compensatory role for an emotion-related network of regions .

11282368|The results showed that the fast acquisition of emotional CRs was dependent on the integrity of the amygdala and the slow acquisition of motor CRs was dependent on the integrity of the cerebellar interpositus nucleus .

11282368|These findings suggest that the amygdala and the cerebellum provide the neuronal substrates of the fast and slow conditioning systems , respectively , and that conditioning-related cerebellar output interacts with the amygdala-based emotional conditioning .

11280935|The brain circuitry underlying emotion includes several territories of the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- , the amygdala , hippocampus , anterior cingulate , and related structures .

11274781|Moreover , orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal cortices target the ventral pallidum and the extended amygdala , through which high-order association areas may activate motor autonomic structures for the expression of emotions .

11274257|Recent studies indicated a selective activation during rapid eye movement -LRB- REM -RRB- sleep of the amygdala known to play a decisive role in the processing of emotional stimuli .

11273416|Expression without recognition : contributions of the human amygdala to emotional communication . .

11273416|A growing body of evidence from humans and other animals suggests the amygdala may be a critical neural substrate for emotional processing .

11273416|In particular , recent studies have shown that damage to the human amygdala impairs the normal appraisal of social signals of emotion , primarily those of fear .

11273416|Although the role of the amygdala in the appraisal of emotion is well established , its importance for the production of emotional expressions is unknown .

11273416|We report a case study of a patient with bilateral amygdaloid damage who , despite a severe deficit in interpreting facial expressions of emotion including fear , exhibits an intact ability to express this and other basic emotions .

11268008|These data suggest that the amygdalo-piriform transition area is a region that influences both emotional and memory processing in parallel by means of pathways to the amygdala and the hippocampus , respectively .

11262578|Is emotion the result of the interaction of different brain regions such as the amygdala , the nucleus accumbens , or the periaqueductal gray matter or is it an emergent property of the whole brain neural network ?

11257281|Differential amygdala activation during emotional decision and recognition memory tasks using unpleasant words : an fMRI study . .

11257281|These results are consistent with the memory modulatory view of amygdala function , which suggests that the amygdala facilitates long-term , but not short-term , memory consolidation of emotionally significant material .

11257281|The control area showed only an effect for Time Course for both the emotional decision and memory tasks , indicating the specificity of the amygdala response to the evaluation of unpleasant words .

11246145|In addition , the prenatally stressed rats showed weaker emotional responses than unstressed control , as indicated by decreases both in ambulation upon initial exposure to an open field and in Fos expression in the amygdala induced by physical stress .

11244481|The amygdala : vigilance and emotion . .

11240308|The ERalpha mRNA expression appears to dominate in the hypothalamus and amygdala , indicating that the alpha-subtype might modulate neuronal cell populations involved in autonomic and reproductive neuroendocrine functions as well as emotional interpretation and processing .

11239901|The amygdala plays a central role in the human response to affective or emotionally charged stimuli , particularly fear-producing stimuli .

11234779|The amygdala plays a central role in emotional memory .

11234779|The cellular mechanisms by which the amygdala participates in emotional learning are believed to be changes in efficacy of synaptic transmission , similar to long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- and long-term depression -LRB- LTD -RRB- .

11234779|These synapse-specific , reversible changes in synaptic strength in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala may be important to amygdala 's role in emotional memory .

11209954|Differential prefrontal cortex and amygdala habituation to repeatedly presented emotional stimuli . .

11209954|We speculate that the right amygdala is part of a dynamic emotional stimulus detection system , while the left is specialized for sustained stimulus evaluations .

11198125|A specialized system mediated by the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus , and involving several neuromodulatory systems , is activated by emotional arousal and serves to regulate memory formation in other brain regions .

11172070|These activations and deactivations include phylogenetically ancient areas of allocortex and transitional cortex that together with the amygdalar/periamygdalar region may subserve functions of emotional representation and regulation of breathing .

11169989|The amygdala orchestrates the formation of behavioral responses to emotionally arousing stimuli .

11169989|Via these pathways , emotionally significant stimuli can evoke behavioral responses that are different from those initiated via projections from the amygdala to the central nucleus .

11166694|This form of interaction between the two stages of learning can be investigated while considering the central role of the amygdala and the cerebellum in emotional and motor conditioning , respectively .

11166694|These findings demonstrate that amygdala-mediated emotional conditioning facilitates the subsequent acquisition of cerebellum-mediated motor responses .

11166127|We suggest that parvalbumin-containing neurons can control emotional responses mediated by the basolateral amygdala by controlling the output from this important brain region .

11163602|To investigate the role of unilateral amygdala lesions on processing emotions , 22 drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy -LRB- TLE -RRB- subjects -LRB- 12 with left-sided and ten with right-sided focus -RRB- were tested , after anterior temporal lobectomy or selective amygdalo-hippocampectomy on two associative learning tasks containing emotional and neutral facial expressions , respectively .

11163602|Taken the extent of amygdala damage into account , an interaction effect could be shown between task -LRB- learning of neutral facial expressions versus emotional facial expressions -RRB- and group -LRB- subjects with little versus considerable amygdala damage -RRB- , indicating worse performance of subjects with considerable amygdala damage in learning emotional facial expressions .

11163602|Subjects with considerable amygdala damage were also significantly impaired in learning emotional facial expressions when compared with control subjects .

11163418|It is proposed that unpleasant emotions depend on the activation of an evolutionarily primitive subcortical circuit , including the amygdala and the neural structures to which it projects .

11160759|We conclude that hippocampus - and amygdala-dependent emotional learning does not depend critically on the activity of ERK1 .

11150336|Within the medial temporal lobe , special attention has been paid to the hippocampus -LRB- HC -RRB- and amygdala -LRB- AG -RRB- because of their role in memory , depression , emotion , and learning .

11134600|Furthermore , evidence suggests that the amygdaloid central nucleus -LRB- ACe -RRB- may influence cardiovascular activity during emotional states .

11124043|Sex-related difference in amygdala activity during emotionally influenced memory storage . .

11124043|We tested the possibility suggested by previous imaging studies that amygdala participation in the storage of emotionally influenced memory is differentially lateralized in men and women .

11124043|Consistent with suggestions from several previously published studies , enhanced activity of the right , but not the left , amygdala in men was related to enhanced memory for the emotional films .

11124043|Conversely , enhanced activity of the left , but not the right , amygdala in women was related to enhanced memory for the emotional films .

11124043|These results demonstrate a clear gender-related lateralization of amygdala involvement in emotionally influenced memory , and indicate that theories of the neurobiology of emotionally influenced memory must begin to account for the influence of gender .

11107881|They underscore the role of the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- and amygdala in 2 broad approach - and withdrawal-related emotion systems .

11055255|This study addressed these 2 contrasting findings by investigating amygdala and adjacent cortical contributions to the evaluation of facial emotion in 12 patients with right and 11 patients with left unilateral anteromedial temporal lobectomy -LRB- RTL and LTL , respectively -RRB- and 23 normal controls .

11054916|Specifically , we focused on the amygdala , a subcortical structure known to play a role in emotional learning and evaluation .

11050021|Notably , they did not activate a cortical ` face area ' when explicitly appraising expressions , or the left amygdala region and left cerebellum when implicitly processing emotional facial expressions .

11033344|A variety of stressful events , including emotional stress , cause a marked increase in noradrenaline release in several brain regions , and especially in the hypothalamus , amygdala and locus coeruleus , in the rat brain .

11029635|The hippocampus , the entorhinal cortex and the amygdala are interconnected structures of the limbic system that are implicated in memory and emotional behaviour .

11027238|Only emotionally valenced olfactory stimuli induced bilateral rCBF increases in the amygdala .

11027238|Finally , the data suggest a superior potency of emotionally valenced olfactory over visual and auditory stimuli in activating the amygdala .

11025335|The amygdala , a structure that plays an important role in coding the emotional significance of stimuli and is heavily interconnected with brainstem nuclei known to be involved in sleep control , has received little attention from sleep researchers .

11011014|The amygdala is important in processing emotion and in the acquisition and expression of fear and anxiety .

11011014|Based on these results , it seems likely that , in the primate , the amygdala plays a role in sleep regulation and may be important in mediating the effects of emotions/stress on sleep .

11000199|Event-related activation in the human amygdala associates with later memory for individual emotional experience . .

11000199|The role of the amygdala in enhancing declarative memory for emotional experiences has been investigated in a number of animal , patient , and brain imaging studies .

11000199|The amygdala had the greatest response to scenes rated as most emotionally intense .

11000199|The degree of activity in the left amygdala during encoding was predictive of subsequent memory only for scenes rated as most emotionally intense .

11000199|These findings support the view that amygdala activation reflects moment-to-moment subjective emotional experience and that this activation enhances memory in relation to the emotional intensity of an experience .

11000197|To investigate the function of the amygdala in human emotional cognition , we investigated the electrodermal activity -LRB- EDA -RRB- in response to masked -LRB- unseen -RRB- visual stimuli .

10988036|Attribute-specific responses , independent of depth of processing , were evident in bilateral fusiform cortices for perceptual oddballs and left amygdala for emotional oddballs .

10986331|Age-related alterations in emotional behaviors and amygdalar corticotropin-releasing factor -LRB- CRF -RRB- and CRF-binding protein expression in aged Fischer 344 rats . .

10978580|These data suggest that via topographically organized projections , the amygdala can modulate the vago-vagal gastrointestinal reflexes in emotional and stressful situations .

10976426|Repressed traumatic emotional memories are encoded in the amygdala , and they are unconsciously enacted through behavior , especially in the transference .

10974425|This GABAergic projection may provide a substrate for inhibition of lower brain stem visceral reflexes , including baroreflex inhibition , through which the central nucleus of the amygdala could participate in cardiovascular regulation related to emotional behaviour and the defence reaction .

10974352|Long-term amygdala kindling in rats as a model for the study of interictal emotionality in temporal lobe epilepsy . .

10973129|Some of the brain regions are recognizably active during the activation of short-term working memory -LRB- e.g. , prefrontal cortex -RRB- , or the storage of information retrieved as long-term explicit memories -LRB- e.g. , hippocampus and related cortical areas -RRB- or the modulation of the storage of memories related to emotional events -LRB- e.g. , amygdala -RRB- .

10964936|The lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is thought to be critical for the specific acquisition of conditioned fear , and the emotionally charged memories related to fear are thought to require a form of synaptic plasticity related to long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- .

10922509|In addition , orbitofrontal and caudal medial -LRB- limbic -RRB- prefrontal cortices receive robust projections from the amygdala , associated with emotional memory , and from medial temporal and thalamic structures associated with long-term memory .

10906795|Does the basolateral amygdala store memories for emotional events ? .

10903405|This article models how emotional centers of the brain , such as the amygdala , interact with sensory and prefrontal cortices -LRB- notably ventral , or orbital , prefrontal cortex -RRB- to generate affective states , attend to motivationally salient sensory events , and elicit motivated behaviors .

10884595|Their correct development in the basolateral amygdaloid complex is critical for the proper emotional functioning in adult live of human and animals .

10862946|Adrenergic activation of the nucleus tractus solitarius potentiates amygdala norepinephrine release and enhances retention performance in emotionally arousing and spatial memory tasks . .

10837507|Impaired emotional declarative memory following unilateral amygdala damage . .

10837507|Case studies of patients with bilateral amygdala damage and functional imaging studies of normal individuals have demonstrated that the amygdala plays a critical role in encoding emotionally arousing stimuli into long-term declarative memory .

10837507|For comparison , our main task used stimuli identical to those used previously to investigate emotional declarative memory in patients with bilateral amygdala damage .

10837507|Contrasts with both brain-damaged and normal control groups showed that subjects with left amygdala damage were impaired in their memory for emotional stimuli , despite entirely normal memory for neutral stimuli -LRB- because of a number of caveats , the findings from subjects with right amygdala damage were less clear -RRB- .

10825577|The amygdaloid complex -LRB- AMY -RRB- is implicated in emotional and motivational aspects of behavior , including the formation of positive reinforcement association .

10774087|Consistent with anatomic heterogeneity , the functions of the amygdala vary from attention to memory to formation of emotional responses to sensory stimuli .

10721680|Animal studies show that amygdala has a role in emotional response , integrating input signals and initiating activities related to them .

10721680|In humans , functional magnetic resonance imaging shows that the amygdala responds preferentially to emotionally charged stimuli .

10721680|Future study of the amygdala promises to shed light on emotional disorders in humans .

10718514|In addition , the AH projected to regions which may be related to the emotional and autonomic responses , i.e. , such regions in the amygdala , midline thalamus , septum , subthalamus , and midbrain .

10716205|Functional neuroimaging experiments have shown that recognition of emotional expressions does not depend on awareness of visual stimuli and that unseen fear stimuli can activate the amygdala via a colliculopulvinar pathway .

10678771|The amygdala is important for memory processes of emotionally motivated learning and the amygdala glutamatergic system may play a key role in this process .

10678771|In this study we assessed the effect of the infusion of -LRB- + / - -RRB- - alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine -LRB- MCPG -RRB- , a metabotropic glutamate receptor -LRB- mGluR -RRB- antagonist , into the basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- on the learning and retention of an emotionally motivated task .

10704753|The amygdala are thought to play an important role in emotional information processing .

10694462|Second , we identified a left amygdala response sensitive to actual retrieval of emotional items .

10694462|These data suggest distinct functional roles for temporal lobe regions during emotional memory retrieval involving context-related tonic anterior temporal pole activation and a phasic item-related amygdala response .

10693814|People with brain injuries involving the amygdala are often poor at recognizing facial expressions of fear , but the extent to which this impairment compromises other signals of the emotion of fear has not been clearly established .

10674800|Findings are discussed in terms of the role of the amygdala in mediating emotional memory .

10651899|Dissociable roles of the central and basolateral amygdala in appetitive emotional learning . .

10651899|Data from neuroimaging studies of normal volunteers and brain-damaged patients perceiving emotional facial expressions , and studies of conditioned freezing in rats , all suggest a specific role for the amygdala in aversive motivation .

10651899|However , the amygdala may also be critical for emotional processing in positive or appetitive settings .

10651899|Together with other data , these results not only support the hypothesis that the amygdala is critical for appetitive as well as aversive learning , but are also consistent with amygdala subsystems subserving distinct aspects of emotional learning .

10651899|Lesions of the dorsal or ventral subiculum were without effect on autoshaping , indicating the lack of involvement of hippocampal processing in this form of emotional behaviour and emphasizing further the neural specificity of the effects seen following central amygdala lesions .

10634350|Traumatic experiences leave emotional imprints involving the amygdala , with facilitated fear-conditioned associations involving declarative memory traces .

10629756|Dopaminergic inputs from the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra are involved in numerous emotional and behavioral functions mediated by the amygdala .

10624542|Previous studies indicated an important role of the amygdala for emotional information processing .

10624542|Increased processing of emotional information might increase amygdala blood flow and subsequently , result in amygdala enlargement .

10619632|These data support the hypothesis that the right hemisphere is involved in emotional states : increased serotonin in the right amygdala is related to anxiety , while cortical dopamine may be associated with attention to the environment .

10601742|Bilateral damage to the human amygdala impairs retrieval of emotional and social information from faces .

10594668|Effects of aspiration versus neurotoxic lesions of the amygdala on emotional responses in monkeys . .

10594668|All previous reports describing alterations in emotional reactivity after amygdala damage in monkeys were based on aspiration or radiofrequency lesions which likely disrupted fibres of passage coursing to and from adjacent ventral and medial temporal cortical areas .

10594668|These findings convincingly demonstrate that the amygdala is crucial for the normal regulation of emotions in monkeys .

10579563|The results obtained with c-Fos mapping of various regions of rat amygdala , combined with a fine dissection of behavioral repertoire , imply that there are specific functional links between particular parts of the structure and distinctive behaviors that reflect various emotional states of the animal .

10578450|We have previously shown that the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CNA -RRB- provides CRF afferents to noradrenergic processes in the peri-LC area that may serve to integrate emotional and cognitive responses to stress .

10575049|Explicit memory may depend on the hippocampus , whereas the amygdala may be part of an emotional memory system .

10575049|Because the amygdala is thought to mediate emotional responses , we examined the apparent discrepancy between the effects of behavioral stress induced 1 hr before HFS to the PP and of amygdala priming on hippocampal plasticity by stimulating the BLA 1 hr before HFS to the PP .

10575047|Long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- in the amygdala is a leading candidate mechanism to explain fear conditioning , a prominent model of emotional memory .

10559431|The amygdala is a limbic structure that kindles readily and regulates the complex neurocircuitry underlying emotional responding .

10559431|Considering the established role of the VTA and the amygdala in emotional responding , such a sensitization mechanism might mediate exaggerated fearfulness .

10559379|The amygdala is intimately involved in emotional behavior , and its role in the generation of anxiety and conditioned fear is well known .

10553032|Substantial evidence from studies of both infra-human and human subjects converges on the view that the enhancing effect of emotional arousal on long-term memory formation depends on an endogenous memory modulatory mechanism consisting of , at minimum , the adrenergic system and the amygdala .

10542437|Long-term potentiation in the amygdala : a mechanism for emotional learning and memory . .

10542437|Compelling new evidence for this view derives from studies of LTP in the amygdala , a brain structure that is essential for simple forms of emotional learning and memory , such as Pavlovian fear conditioning in rats .

10530728|Intact recognition of emotional prosody following amygdala damage . .

10530728|Bilateral damage to the amygdala in a variety of animal species can impair emotional reactions to stimuli in several sensory modalities .

10530728|We examined two subjects with complete bilateral amygdala damage , and seven with unilateral amygdala damage , on a standardized task of emotional prosody recognition .

10530728|One of the bilateral amygdala subjects , whose lesions were restricted to the amygdala , was entirely normal in recognizing emotion in prosody on all tasks , the other , whose damage included substantial lesions also in extra-amygdalar structures , especially in right hemisphere , was normal on most , albeit not all , measures of emotional prosody recognition .

10530728|We suggest that the human amygdala 's role in recognizing emotion in prosody may not be as critical as it is for facial expressions , and that extra-amygdalar structures in right hemisphere may be more important for recognizing emotional prosody .

10530728|It remains possible that recognition of emotion in classes of auditory stimuli other than prosody will require the amygdala .

10526135|In the brain many nuclei are involved in emotional reaction , stress or defense response ; among them the nucleus amygdaloideus centralis -LRB- AC -RRB- is the most important one which widely connects with other nuclei controlling emotion and stress , such as nucleus ventromedialis -LRB- NVM -RRB- , nucleus dorsomedialis -LRB- NDM -RRB- , nucleus paraventricularis -LRB- NPV -RRB- etc. .

10509837|The data demonstrate : firstly , that processing of vocal emotion involves a bilaterally distributed network of brain regions ; and secondly , that processing of fear-related auditory stimuli involves context-specific interactions between the amygdala and other cortical and brainstem regions implicated in fear processing .

10509835|Normal recognition of emotional similarity between facial expressions following bilateral amygdala damage . .

10509835|Bilateral damage to the amygdala in humans has been previously linked to two deficits in recognizing emotion in facial expressions : recognition of individual basic emotions , especially fear , and recognition of similarity among emotional expressions .

10509835|Although several studies have examined recognition of individual emotions following amygdala damage , only one subject has been examined on recognition of similarity .

10509835|These results indicate that , like the recognition of individual basic emotions in facial expressions , the recognition of similarity among emotional expressions does not have an absolute dependence on the amygdala .

10509833|Recognition of facial emotion in nine individuals with bilateral amygdala damage . .

10509833|Findings from several case studies have shown that bilateral amygdala damage impairs recognition of emotions in facial expressions , especially fear .

10509833|In a collaborative study to facilitate such comparisons , we report here the recognition of emotional facial expressions in nine subjects with bilateral amygdala damage , using a sensitive and quantitative assessment .

10495084|Long-term amygdala kindling produces substantial changes in emotional behavior in rats .

10495084|These results suggest that the emotionality produced by long-term amygdala kindling is fundamentally defensive in nature .

10468630|Studies in animals demonstrate a crucial role for the amygdala in emotional and social behavior , especially as related to fear and aggression .

10468630|Whereas lesion and functional-imaging studies in humans indicate the amygdala 's participation in assessing the significance of nonverbal as well as paralinguistic cues , direct evidence for its role in the emotional processing of linguistic cues is lacking .

10468630|In addition , the results reinforce the amygdala 's role in the modulation of the perception of , and response to , emotionally salient stimuli .

10456070|Impaired declarative memory for emotional material following bilateral amygdala damage in humans . .

10456070|Although studies in animals have shown that nondeclarative emotional memory -LRB- behaviors associated with emotional situations -RRB- may be impaired by lesions of the amygdala , little is known about the neural underpinnings of emotional memory in humans , especially in regard to declarative memory -LRB- memory for facts that can be assessed verbally -RRB- .

10456070|The data support the hypothesis that the human amygdala normally enhances acquisition of declarative knowledge regarding emotionally arousing stimuli .

10449260|Emphasis is placed on the quantification of the activity from two ROIs , fusiform gyrus -LRB- FG -RRB- and amygdala -LRB- AM -RRB- , which have been best studied in the context of processing of faces and facial expressions of emotion , respectively .

10420169|The lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is a critical component of the circuitry through which environmental stimuli are endowed with emotional meaning through association with painful or threatening events .

10415695|Effect of amygdala kindling on emotional behavior and benzodiazepine receptor binding in rats . .

10415674|The orbital C metabolism is also abnormally elevated during depression , but is negatively correlated with both depression severity and amygdala metabolism , suggesting that this structure may be activated as a compensatory mechanism to modulate amygdala activity or amygdala-driven emotional responses .

10415674|These data suggest a neural model in which dysfunction of limbic PFC structures impairs the modulation of the amygdala , leading to abnormal processing of emotional stimuli .

10415672|Selective disease of the amygdala can yield deficits in the ability to judge and evaluate emotional expressions .

10415671|As mesolimbic structures , including the amygdala and ventral striatum , are thought to play a significant role in imparting emotional valence to external stimuli , we here examine the mesolimbic findings of H215O PET studies designed to probe the functional neuroanatomy of psychosis .

10415661|These lines of behavioral research have revealed that sub-systems in the basal forebrain and amygdala serve adaptive functions beyond the domains of motivation and emotion to include attention and cognition .

10405084|The hippocampus , amygdala and related functional circuits have been implicated in the regulation of emotional expression and memory processes , which are affected in major depression .

10383620|Neuroendocrine responses to an emotional stressor : evidence for involvement of the medial but not the central amygdala . .

10383620|The amygdala plays a pivotal role in the generation of appropriate responses to emotional stimuli .

10383620|In the present study , c-fos expression , amygdala lesion and retrograde tracing experiments were performed on adult rats in order to re-evaluate the role of the central as opposed to the medial amygdala in generating neuroendocrine responses to an emotional stressor .

10383620|Brief restraint -LRB- 15 min -RRB- was used as a representative emotional stressor and was found to elicit c-fos expression much more strongly in the medial than central nucleus of the amygdala ; relatively few Fos-positive cells were seen in other amygdala nuclei .

10383620|To assess whether the role of the medial amygdala in the control of neuroendocrine cell responses to emotional stress might involve a direct projection to such cells , retrograde tracing of amygdala projections to the paraventricular nucleus was performed in combination with Fos immunolabelling .

10383620|This showed that although some medial amygdala cells activated by exposure to an emotional stressor project directly to the paraventricular nucleus , the number is very small .

10383620|These findings provide the first direct evidence that it is the medial rather than the central amygdala that is critical to hypothalamic neuroendocrine cell responses during an emotional response , and also provide the first evidence that the amygdala governs oxytocin as well as HPA axis responses to an emotional stressor .

10377356|However , given the role of the amygdala in emotional processing , we asked whether amygdala damage also would interfere with decision-making .

26976254|Serotonergic raphe neurons diffusely project to a variety of brain regions -LRB- e.g. cortex , amygdala , hippocampus -RRB- and play known roles in integrating emotion , cognition , motor function as well as in food intake , sleep , pain , and sexual activity .

10332801|These results provide evidence that cocaine withdrawal activates CRF neurons in the amygdala , a site that has been implicated in emotional and anxiogenic effects of stress and drug withdrawal syndromes .

10319564|Stresses such as immobilization or electric foot shock , wherein the physical factors rather than emotional ones were greatly involved , caused more marked increases in NA release in the more extended brain regions , as compared to psychological stress and conditioned fear , which caused increases in NA release preferentially in the hypothalamus , amygdala and locus coeruleus -LRB- LC -RRB- region .

10234229|The amygdala has long been implicated in the display of emotional behavior and emotional information processing , especially in the context of aversive events .

10234222|The amygdala has been consistently identified as playing a crucial role in both the perception of emotional cues and the production of emotional responses , with some evidence suggesting that it is particularly involved with fear-related negative affect .

10202567|Exposure to traumatic material in PTSD -LRB- but not non-PTSD -RRB- subjects resulted in a decrease in blood flow in medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- area 25 -RRB- , an area postulated to play a role in emotion through inhibition of amygdala responsiveness .

10195224|Using positron emission tomography , we show that bilateral amygdala activity during memory encoding is correlated with enhanced episodic recognition memory for both pleasant and aversive visual stimuli relative to neutral stimuli , and that this relationship is specific to emotional stimuli .

10195224|The human amygdala seems to modulate the strength of conscious memory for events according to emotional importance , regardless of whether the emotion is pleasant or aversive .

10103138|Interestingly , coexpression of all four Y-receptors , at different levels , is particularly evident within the limbic system , including the hypothalamus , hippocampus , amygdala , piriform and cingulate cortices and tegmental areas , all of which are heavily involved in behaviour , emotion and homeostatic regulation .

10088149|This report describes studies of delta-sleep-inducing peptide in the mechanism of compensating emotional behavior following disruption of a number of structures of the limbic complex -LRB- the septum and amygdala -RRB- .

10088149|The results obtained showed that the septum and amygdala play a significant role in the mechanisms of resistance to emotional stress .

10088149|Administration of peptide to animals with lesions to the septum or amygdala increased their resistance to emotional stress , as indicated by open field test behavior , survival , and adrenal and thymus weight in stress conditions .

10076093|Facial emotion recognition activated inferior frontal cortex , amygdala and different parts of temporal cortex in a relatively consistent time sequence .

9990084|Neuroimaging studies have shown differential amygdala responses to masked -LRB- '' unseen '' -RRB- emotional stimuli .

9989557|Experimental work in animals and humans has demonstrated that the amygdaloid complex plays a crucial role in emotional memory , i.e. , memory of events arousing strong emotions .

9989557|In 36 patients with probable Alzheimer 's disease who experienced the 1995 earthquake in Kobe , Japan , memories of events surrounding the earthquake were examined as an index of emotional memory with the use of a semistructured interview , and amygdalar and hippocampal volumes were quantified by magnetic resonance imaging .

9989557|Irrespective of generalized brain atrophy and cognitive impairments , emotional memory was correlated more with normalized amygdalar volume -LRB- right and left averaged -RRB- than with normalized hippocampal volume .

9989557|The results indicate that impairment of emotional event memory in patients with Alzheimer 's disease is related to intensity of amygdalar damage and provide evidence of the amygdala 's involvement in emotional memory in humans .

9886046|The amygdaloid complex and hippocampal formation mediate functions involving emotion and memory .

9886229|The role of the amygdala in modulating emotional memory is highlighted , as well as some of its unique properties such as metaplasticity -LRB- i.e. , the differential direction of long-term adaptation , either potentiation or depression -RRB- in response to the same input as a function of the prior history of stimulation .

9834541|The amygdaloid nucleus , the frontal lobe and the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus belong to a network of connections that could be involved in emotions .

9821068|For example , damage to the amygdala may be associated with an impaired ability to recognized emotional faces and a reduction of affect , especially anger , rage , and fear .

9816735|However , as the amygdala processes and stores emotional experiences in memory , patients may also demonstrate trauma related symptoms , including flashbacks as well as shrinking retrograde amnesia .

9807645|On the other hand , a left-sided prefrontal mechanism would inhibit the amygdala resulting in dampened autonomic output , hypoemotionality , and lack of emotional coloring that would in turn , be reported as feelings of '' unreality or detachment . ''

9802236|Our findings therefore -LRB- i -RRB- support the differential localization of the neural substrates of fear and disgust ; -LRB- ii -RRB- confirm the involvement of the amygdala in the emotion of fear , whether evoked by facial or vocal expressions ; -LRB- iii -RRB- confirm the involvement of the anterior insula and the striatum in reactions to facial expressions of disgust ; and -LRB- iv -RRB- suggest a possible general role for the perception of emotional expressions for the superior temporal gyrus .

9792326|This cellular substrate for amygdaloid-CRF modulation of brain noradrenergic activity may serve as a mechanism for the integration of emotional and cognitive responses to stress .

9740761|We found activity in the left amygdaloid complex associated with the encoding of emotional stimuli , although this activation appeared early in the scanning session and was not detectable during recognition memory .

9698186|In addition and considering the results observed in rats that were poor learners , we suggest that emotional factors and/or other amygdaloid pathways different from the ST could participate in the effects of posttraining epinephrine , along with the ST.

9683321|Extensive research in animals implicates stress hormones and the amygdaloid complex as key , interacting modulators of memory consolidation for emotional events .

9683321|Human-subject studies confirm the prediction of animal work that the amygdala is involved with the formation of enhanced declarative memory for emotionally arousing events .

9681964|Persistence of the interictal emotionality produced by long-term amygdala kindling in rats . .

9681964|Long-term amygdala kindling in rats results in large and reliable increases in emotional behaviour that model the interictal emotionality often observed in temporal lobe epileptics -LSB- Kalynchuk L. E. et al. -LRB- 1997 -RRB- Biol .

9674587|The amygdala is a key structure in the brain 's integration of emotional meaning with perception and experience .

9674587|Patients with depression have impaired functioning in emotional tasks involving the amygdala , and have abnormal resting amygdala blood flow .

9648549|The present results indicate that the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex respond to aversive stimuli in both the olfactory and gustatory modalities , and highlight the role of the pregenual cingulate in negative emotional processing .

9643556|The amygdaloid nuclear complex is critical for producing appropriate emotional and behavioral responses to biologically relevant sensory stimuli .

9624002|Studies in animals have implicated the amygdala in emotional and social behaviours , especially those related to fear and aggression .

9624002|Although lesion and functional imaging studies in humans have demonstrated the amygdala 's participation in recognizing emotional facial expressions , its role in human social behaviour has remained unclear .

9624001|Conscious and unconscious emotional learning in the human amygdala . .

9620698|These results provide further evidence for the conservation of amygdala function across species and implicate an amygdalar contribution to both acquisition and extinction processes during associative emotional learning tasks .

9549487|A neuromodulatory role for the human amygdala in processing emotional facial expressions . .

9549487|We used functional neuroimaging to test two hypotheses : -LRB- i -RRB- that the amygdala and some of its functionally connected structures mediate specific neural responses to fearful expressions ; -LRB- ii -RRB- that the early visual processing of emotional faces can be influenced by amygdalar activity .

9549309|Further , psychological stress , wherein the rats were given no electrical shock , but exposed to the emotional responses such as struggling , vocalization , jumping and defecation shown by the other electrically-shocked rats , increased noradrenaline release preferentially in the hypothalamus , amygdala and locus coeruleus .

9533388|Their results contrast with those of RS , with relative sparing of the amygdala region and unimpaired recognition of emotion , pointing clearly toward the importance of the amygdala in the recognition of fear .

9522399|Functional MRI reveals left amygdala activation during emotion . .

9464991|In the amygdala , experiential modification of activity-dependent long-term synaptic plasticity adds flexibility to the ways in which synaptic strength can be modified and could play a role in diverse amygdala-dependent processes , including the formation , storage , and extinction of emotional memory and the regulation of epileptogenesis .

9473643|Long-term amygdala kindling in rats produces increases in emotionality -LRB- Kalynchuk et al. , Biol .

9383524|The response of the 2 crossed lesioned groups also was smaller than that of the sham-operated and unilateral lesioned groups , but significant conditioned stimulus-evoked bradycardia occurred in both , suggesting that although interactions between the amygdala and mPFC may normally occur during associative emotional responding , these connections are not necessary for the acquisition of conditioned bradycardia .

9412517|Masked presentations of emotional facial expressions modulate amygdala activity without explicit knowledge . .

9412517|Functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- of the human brain was used to study whether the amygdala is activated in response to emotional stimuli , even in the absence of explicit knowledge that such stimuli were presented .

9412517|This difference was composed of significant signal increases in the amygdala to masked fearful faces as well as significant signal decreases to masked happy faces , consistent with the notion that the level of amygdala activation is affected differentially by the emotional valence of external stimuli .

9415901|Using repetitive electrical stimulations -LRB- kindling -RRB- or local applications of a neuroexcitotoxin in limbic structures -LRB- mainly the amygdala and hippocampus -RRB- , several authors have reported lasting changes of emotional reactivity in cats and rats .

9384379|Here we report that mice lacking Ras-GRF are impaired in the process of memory consolidation , as revealed by emotional conditioning tasks that require the function of the amygdala ; learning and short-term memory are intact .

9364082|Activation of the amygdala in rats produces cardiovascular changes that include increases in heart rate and arterial pressure as well as behavioral changes characteristic of emotional arousal .

9403689|The amygdala plays a critical role in the mediation of emotional responses , particularly fear , in both humans and animals .

9398590|The early modulation is mediated locally by GABAergic , cholinergic , and noradrenergic synapses and by putative retrograde synaptic messengers , and extrinsically by the amygdala and possibly the medial septum , which handle emotional components of memories and are direct or indirect sites of action for several hormones and neurotransmitters .

9364666|In spite of the fact that the amygdala has been implicated in a variety of functions , ranging from attention to memory to emotion , it has not attracted neuroscientists to the same extent as its laminated neighbours , in particular the hippocampus and surrounding cortex .

9328059|Interactions between catecholamines and the amygdala in emotional memory : subclinical and clinical evidence . .

9339304|We recently reported that patients who had received unilateral temporal lobectomy , including the amygdala and hippocampus , show impaired acquisition in a fear conditioning task -LRB- LaBar , LeDoux , Spencer , & Phelps , 1995 -RRB- , indicating a deficit in emotional memory .

9332015|Here we use comparative analyses to show that social group size is independently correlated with the size of non-V1 neocortical areas , but not with other more proximate components of the visual system or with brain systems associated with emotional cueing -LRB- e.g. the amygdala -RRB- .

9266772|Projections from the medial geniculate body -LRB- MGB -RRB- to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- have been implicated in the conditioning of emotional reactions to acoustic stimuli .

9296566|The possible role of the lateral central amygdalar nucleus in circuitry mediating conditioned emotional responses is discussed ; changing neuropeptide levels in the lateral part may act as a ` gain control ' for reversible long-term modulation -LRB- LTM -RRB- of medial part output .

9237754|The amygdala has long been thought to be involved in emotional behaviour , and its role in anxiety and conditioned fear has been highlighted .

9237754|We suggest that theories of amygdala function should take into account the roles of discrete amygdala subsystems in controlling different components of integrated emotional responses .

9214540|It has been reported that the acoustic thalamus of the rat sends projection fibers to both the temporal cortical areas and the lateral amygdaloid nucleus to mediate conditioned emotional responses to an acoustic stimulus .

9210741|Film-generated emotion was associated with significantly greater increases in activity bilaterally in the occipitotemporparietal cortex , lateral cerebellum , hypothalamus , and a region that includes the anterior temporal cortex , amygdala , and hippocampal formation , suggesting that these regions participate in the emotional response to certain exteroceptive sensory stimuli .

9238208|Substantial evidence from animal and human subject studies converges on the view that memory for emotionally arousing events is modulated by an endogenous memory-modulating system consisting , at minimum , of stress hormones and the amygdaloid complex .

9115384|Recent studies of the human amygdala have shed new light on its roles in two distinct , but related processes : emotional memory and the evaluation of emotional stimuli .

9108115|Electrophysiologic and lesion studies of animals increasingly implicate the amygdala in aspects of emotional processing .

9108115|To examine the contributions of the amygdala and other limbic and paralimbic regions to emotional processing , we exposed healthy subjects to aversive olfactory stimuli while measuring regional cerebral blood flow -LRB- rCBF -RRB- with positron emission tomography .

9108115|These findings provide evidence that the human amygdala participates in the hedonic or emotional processing of olfactory stimuli .

21223850|Future directions include application of the biophysical model to questions about temporal summation in the two sensory input paths to amygdala , and modeling of an attentional interrupt signal that will extend the emotional processing model to interactions with cognitive systems .

9168484|The levels of biogenic amines and of a number of the products of their metabolism were studied in the hypothalamic nuclei in Wistar and August rats , which have different levels of resistance to emotional stress ; levels were also studied in structures functionally and anatomically associated with the hypothalamic nuclei , i.e. , the reticular formation of the midbrain , the amygdaloid body , the septum , the locus ceruleus , the dorsal cervical nucleus , and the ventral region of the tegmentum .

9034538|Changes in emotional behavior produced by long-term amygdala kindling in rats . .

9034538|The effects of long-term amygdala kindling on emotional behavior were investigated .

9034538|Together , these results suggest that long-term amygdala kindling in rats is a useful model for studying the emotionality associated with temporal lobe epilepsy .

9247964|Neuronal activity within the hippocampal formation , the amygdaloid body , and the ventral parts of the basal ganglia has been examined most thoroughly in studies on neuroendocrine , autonomic and cognitive functions , or at the level of emotional and psychomotor behaviors .

9065841|The central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- is an area involved in emotional learning and stress , and identification of Ca2 + currents is essential to understanding interneuronal communication through this nucleus .

9062657|The assumption that comparable processes occur in animal and human subjects is supported by evidence that , in human subjects , emotionally influenced memory is blocked by a beta-adrenergic blocker and by lesions of the amygdaloid complex .

9027863|The various components of the extended amygdala , together with the shell of the accumbens , are ideally structured to generate endocrine , autonomic and somatomotor aspects of emotional and motivational states .

9037502|It was suggested that DA VTA neurons regulate the excitatory aspects of fear expression by gating levels of aversive emotional arousal within the amygdala-based fear system .

9000073|The amygdalar complex is a medial temporal lobe structure in the brain which is widely considered to be involved in the neural substrates of emotion .

9000073|There is impairment of social perception after amygdala damage , with defective recognition of facial expressions of emotion .

9000073|Among the basic emotions , the processing of fear and anger has been shown to be disrupted by amygdala damage .

9000073|Although it remains puzzling why this not found in all cases , the importance of the amygdala in negative emotion , and especially fear , has been confirmed by conditioning , memory and positron emission tomography -LRB- PET -RRB- experiments .

9000073|Central to our understanding of these findings is the question of whether the amygdala is involved specifically in the perception of visual signals of emotion emanating from the face , or more widely in the perception of emotion in all sensory modalities .

9000073|This shows that the amygdala 's role in the recognition of certain emotions is not confined to vision , which is consistent with its being involved in the appraisal of danger and the emotion of fear .

8946285|The prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- and the amygdala are involved in a number of common functions , such as emotional and social behavior , stress , visceral functions , ingestive behavior , self-stimulation , and certain aspects of learning and memory .

9010003|Startle reflex and emotion modulation impairment after a right amygdala lesion . .

9010003|The data confirm , in the human , previous results from the literature in other species on amygdala involvement in startle and emotional responses .

9010003|Furthermore , the observation of the importance of the right amygdala in the modulation of emotion is consistent with the hypothesis of right hemisphere specialization for aversive emotions .

8986337|It was suggested that VTA neurons and their forebrain DA projections regulate levels of aversive emotional arousal within the amygdala-based fear system .

8942964|The central hypothesis guiding the research reviewed in this paper is that emotional arousal activates the amygdala and that such activation results in the modulation of memory storage occurring in other brain regions .

8942964|beta-Blockers and amygdala lesions attenuate the effects of emotional arousal on memory .

8942964|Additionally , 3-week recall of emotional material is highly correlated with positronemission tomography activation -LRB- cerebral glucose metabolism -RRB- of the right amygdala during encoding .

8938120|In the counterbalanced experiment , the amygdala also responded preferentially to happy versus neutral faces , suggesting a possible generalized response to emotionally valenced stimuli .

8938120|Thus , the human amygdala responds preferentially to emotionally valenced faces and rapidly habituates to them .

8916192|Therefore , we conclude that the background noise facilitation does not involve emotional components that are mediated by the amygdala .

8893004|The amygdala is thought to play a crucial role in emotional and social behaviour .

8893004|In humans , lesions of the amygdala can lead to selective deficits in the recognition of fearful facial expressions and impaired fear conditioning , and direct electrical stimulation evokes fearful emotional responses .

8893004|The findings provide direct evidence that the human amygdala is engaged in processing the emotional salience of faces , with a specificity of response to fearful facial expressions .

8876259|Correlations of metabolic increases in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , medial temporal lobe -LRB- amygdala -RRB- , and cerebellum with self-reports of craving suggest that a distributed neural network , which integrates emotional and cognitive aspects of memory , links environmental cues with cocaine craving .

8906500|The amygdaloid complex plays an important role in the detection of emotional stimuli , the generation of emotional responses , the formation of emotional memories , and perhaps other complex associational processes .

8891302|It is concluded that amygdala kindling does not change emotional responding as measured by the ASR in rats .

8774879|Given the role of the amygdaloid complexes in the acquisition of emotionally influenced memories , the pattern of activation in the amygdala and the cortical areas provides a biological basis for the processing of some types of memory during REM sleep .

8921274|Activity-dependent facilitation of hippocampal plasticity by the basomedial and basolateral amygdala may underlie memory processing associated with emotion .

8756453|Considerable evidence suggests that various discrete nuclei within the amygdala complex are critically involved in the assignment of emotional significance or value to events through associative learning .

8755595|Positron emission tomography of cerebral glucose metabolism in adult human subjects was used to investigate amygdaloid complex -LRB- AC -RRB- activity associated with the storage of long-term memory for emotionally arousing events .

8949253|They are compatible with a primary network for the integration of emotional experience in inferior frontal cortex , striatum and amygdala which is partially supported by the findings from relevant lesions and activation studies in normal controls .

8984978|From a pathophysiological standpoint , it would appear that neural nets centered in the amygdala-temporo polar cortex are critical for the integration of sensory perceptions and mental imagery with appropriate emotional tone and quality as well as with their accompanying somatic markers , as they receive afferents from the major projection systems of the prosencephalon and lie in nodes strategic to modify the ongoing activity of multiple parallel brain systems .

8776666|We conclude that visceral activation accompanying emotional response to stress is likely to involve inhibition of GABAergic neurons in the mNTS by non-GABA-containing amygdaloid efferents .

8755053|Upon destruction of the orbito-frontal area , the dominant role in behaviour regulation is taken over by the '' emotional part '' of the brain , whereas the destruction of the postcommissural MFB -LRB- reduction of the amygdalar influence on the hypothalamus -RRB- creates conditions for functional prevalence of the '' informational brain '' .

8725966|Other new evidence emphasizes the role of peripheral influences to the brain on emotional memory , as well as the critical contribution of the amygdaloid complex in modulation of memory by emotional arousal .

8725964|The amygdala and emotion . .

8725964|The amygdala complex has long been known as part of the neural circuitry critical for emotion .

8725964|Beyond its role in emotional reactivity , studies of animal models and patients with amygdala damage demonstrate its importance in emotional learning , whereby cues acquire significance through association with rewarding or aversive events .

8800655|Changes in incentive and emotion have been demonstrated in monkeys with amygdala lesions and monkeys with cingulate and medial frontal lesions .

8800655|In order to better understand the role of the NA and anterior cingulate cortex in processing emotional and motivational stimuli , studies were undertaken which compared the emotional and motivational behaviour of monkeys with NA lesions or anterior cingulate lesions with previous studies on amygdala-lesioned monkeys .

8800655|These tasks had previously been used to examine the emotional response of monkeys with amygdala lesions .

8800655|These studies suggest that lesions of the NA or the anterior cingulate cortex result in substantial changes in emotional behavior , however , these changes do not mimic those found following lesions of the amygdala .

8560947|Content of cAMP in the frontal cortex -LRB- FC -RRB- , hippocampus -LRB- HP -RRB- , hypothalamus -LRB- HT -RRB- and amygdala -LRB- A -RRB- was determined in 20-month old male Wistar rats with different types of behaviour in '' emotional resonance '' test .

7666173|We addressed the possibility that unilateral amygdala damage might be sufficient to impair recognition of emotional expressions .

7582824|The septohippocampal system and the amygdala have been implicated in cognitive and emotional processes .

7582824|These results suggest that there are dissociations between the effects of septal and fimbria-fornix lesions and that the interactions between the amygdala and septum in cognitive and emotional processes are task dependent .

8532847|Amygdala role in emotion was reviewed in reference to recent amygdala lesion studies and neuronal responses in the rat amygdala to conditioned stimuli .

8532847|Extensive lesion studies suggest that the amygdala is crucial in various kinds of motivated and emotional behavior , and related autonomic responses .

7659604|Given its importance in the memory system of the medial temporal lobe , as the recipient of the emotional valencing from the amygdala , and as a key '' loop '' structure for cognitive functional integrity , the hippocampus may be a nodal area in the development of rational as opposed to delusional thinking .

7608677|Whereas corticobulbar tracts carry the information for voluntary facial innervation , efferents from the amygdala and the lateral hypothalamus are candidates for the somatomotor aspects of emotions .

7597162|In this study a T2 * FLASH sequence -LRB- TR 240ms , TE 60ms , slice thickness 4 mm , alpha = 40 degrees , matrix 64 x 128 -RRB- was used to investigate changes in signal intensity within the temporal lobe and the amygdala during experimentally induced emotions .

7796142|The amygdala , which is important in the control of emotional and autonomic responses to stress , contains CRF nerve terminals , CRF cell bodies , and CRF receptors .

7780731|The amygdala in the brain plays a critical role in learning emotional components of experience , such as conditioned fear ; these processes in turn affect many other aspects of memory and cognition .

7895001|The presence of impairments affecting the learning of new faces and the comprehension of gaze direction and facial expressions of emotion is consistent with the hypothesis of a role for the amygdala in learning and social behaviour .

8646279|Thus , the hippocampal formation , associated with mnemonic processes , targets predominantly medial prefrontal cortices , whereas the amygdala , associated with emotional aspects of memory , issues robust projections to orbital limbic cortices .

7990957|Impaired recognition of emotion in facial expressions following bilateral damage to the human amygdala . .

7990957|Studies in animals have shown that the amygdala receives highly processed visual input , contains neurons that respond selectively to faces , and that it participates in emotion and social behaviour .

7990957|Although studies in epileptic patients support its role in emotion , determination of the amygdala 's function in humans has been hampered by the rarity of patients with selective amygdala lesions .

7990957|Here , with the help of one such rare patient , we report findings that suggest the human amygdala may be indispensable to : -LRB- 1 -RRB- recognize fear in facial expressions ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- recognize multiple emotions in a single facial expression ; but -LRB- 3 -RRB- is not required to recognize personal identity from faces .

7990957|These results suggest that damage restricted to the amygdala causes very specific recognition impairments , and thus constrains the broad notion that the amygdala is involved in emotion .

7874515|In agreement with its well-known effect on the emotional component of pain , MS administered to rats exposed to footshock caused a significant decrease in LCMRglu compared to footshock-saline rats in limbic structures such as the diagonal band of Broca , lateral septum , bed nucleus of the stria terminalis , horizontal limb of the diagonal band , habenular complex and medial amygdala .

7834346|Cholecystokinin blockade of emotional stress - and CRF-induced colonic motor alterations in rats : role of the amygdala . .

7530817|The amygdala has been associated with the recognition of emotionally relevant stimuli while the mesolimbic dopamine system is implicated with reward mechanisms .

7524533|Following DB lesion an increase in emotional-defensive excitation occurred and HPLC analysis showed a significant reduction of NA concentration in the posterior hypothalamus , midbrain central gray matter and frontal cortex and decreased turnover of 5-HT in all '' emotional brain areas '' -LRB- hypothalamus , midbrain , amygdala , hippocampus -RRB- and frontal cortex .

7946623|Autopsy of a patient with mild dementia associated with an emotional disorder characterized by paroxysmal rage and excitement during the clinical course revealed massive argyrophilic grains in the subicular , entorhinal and amygdaloid regions , and to a lesser extent in other limbic areas as well .

7946621|The septal nucleus has close connections with the hippocampus and amygdala and is known to be involved in emotional behavior .

8023565|It is assumed that such mental departures in humans as emotional dullness and increased automatism may be developed during an increased endogenous 5-HT release in the amygdala .

8170521|CRF is present in high concentrations in the limbic brain region , the amygdala , an area important in emotional and autonomic responses to stress .

8050513|These findings , which provide the first characterization of acoustic response properties of multimodal cells in the auditory thalamus and of cells in the auditory thalamus that project to amygdala , suggest insights into the emotional functions of the thalamoamygdala pathway .

8050512|Projections from the auditory thalamus to the amygdala have been implicated in the processing of the emotional significance of auditory stimuli .

7822117|The role of the amygdala in emotional learning . .

8131056|In contrast , flumazenil-precipitated diazepam withdrawal produced a marked increase in glucose use in structures of the Papez circuit of emotion -LRB- mammillary body , anterior thalamus , cingulate cortex -RRB- , together with increases in the septal nucleus , basolateral amygdala and nucleus accumbens .

8136053|Localization in the amygdala of the amnestic action of diazepam on emotional memory . .

8136051|The neural system underlying emotional memory critically involves the amygdala and structures with which it is connected .

8136051|Afferent inputs from sensory processing areas of the thalamus and cortex mediate emotional learning in situations involving specific sensory cues , whereas learning about the emotional significance of more general , contextual cues involves projections to the amygdala from the hippocampal formation .

8136051|Within the amygdala , the lateral nucleus -LRB- AL -RRB- is the sensory interface and the central nucleus the linkage with motor systems involved in the control of species-typical emotional behaviors and autonomic responses .

8309544|The significance of this finding lies in the fact that the intercalated cell masses are located at the interface between the basolateral nuclear group and the centromedial complex , the main route through which the amygdaloid complex can directly influence hypothalamic and brainstem centers involved in the elaboration of autonomic responses and species-specific emotional behaviors .

8109874|An excitatory amino acid-mediated form of synaptic plasticity in the lateral amygdala may be responsible in part for emotional learning .

7691009|The contribution of the amygdala to normal and abnormal emotional states . .

7691009|Lesion studies in monkeys have provided some of the most compelling evidence for the involvement of the amygdala in emotional and social behaviour .

7691009|A number of recent studies now indicate that the amygdala is involved in a specific class of stimulus-reward associations and this discovery , combined with important anatomical findings , has made it possible to gain a much more detailed appreciation of the contribution of the amygdala to emotion in non-human primates .

7691009|In parallel with this , it appears increasingly likely that amygdala dysfunction contributes to the emotional changes that accompany certain neurological disorders , including dementia and schizophrenia .

8350125|Neurons in the amygdala are implicated in mediating hedonic appreciation , emotional expression , and conditioning , particularly as these relate to feeding .

8402403|Response characteristics of amygdaloid neurons provoked by emotionally significant environmental stimuli in cats , with special reference to response durations . .

8402403|These findings were considered to be compatible with the hypothesis that the amygdala plays an important role in converting environmental stimuli into emotions such as rage or fear .

8362559|The data are given testifying that the frontal and temporal areas of the neocortex , hippocampus , amygdala and hypothalamus are correspondingly connected with reflecting-estimating , compensatory , transferring and reinforcing functions of emotions .

8451123|These results suggest that brief cerebral exposures to weak magnetic fields that simulate the burst-firing of amygdaloid cells may affect specific limbic emotions .

8450963|To investigate amygdaloid contribution to stimulus-affect association and to emotional behavior , single neuron activity was recorded in the basolateral and corticomedial amygdala of the rat amygdala during discrimination of conditioned cue tones associated with positive -LRB- glucose and intracranial self-stimulation -RRB- and negative -LRB- weak electric footshock -RRB- unconditioned stimuli .

24487116|We conclude from these findings that the role of the amygdala is to process mnemonic events in a way that a specific emotional significance can be found and reactivated .

8491264|As the amygdaloid complex has been implicated in emotional behaviour , particularly in the mediation of fear , these findings substantiate the concept that the amygdaloid complex plays a key role for the enhancement of the ASR by conditioned and unconditioned fear .

1360318|Glutamate immunoreactive terminals in the lateral amygdaloid nucleus : a possible substrate for emotional memory . .

1430331|We conclude -LRB- 1 -RRB- that cortical afferents of CGp derive predominantly from neocortical areas including those with well established sensory and motor functions ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- that limbic projections to CGp originate primarily in structures , including the hippocampus , which are associated with memory , as opposed to structures , including the amygdala , which are associated with emotional and instinctual behavior ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- that CGp contains subregions in which complex , ocular , or somatic afferents predominate .

1527602|Based upon the connectivity between these portions of the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala and evidence that the amygdala is involved in emotional modulation , activity was measured in the left amygdala and found to be significantly increased in the depressed group .

21554633|The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of bilateral electrolytic lesions of the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CEA -RRB- in comparison with sham lesions on neuroendocrine responses during conditioned emotional stress in male Wistar rats .

1613543|The lateral amygdaloid nucleus -LRB- AL -RRB- is anatomically connected with sensory processing structures in the thalamus and cortex and is believed to be critically involved in emotional processing by virtue of these connections .

1638153|The amygdala appears to play an essential role in many aspects of emotional information processing and behavior .

1638153|Studies over the past year have begun to clarify the anatomical organization of the amygdala and the contribution of its individual subregions to emotional functions , especially emotional learning and memory .

1638153|Researchers can now point to plausible circuits involved in the transmission of sensory inputs into the amygdala , between amygdaloid subregions , and to efferent targets in cortical and subcortical regions , for specific emotional learning and memory processes .

1741445|Many studies have investigated the role of the septum and the amygdala in emotional behavior .

1600893|He differentiates '' visceral emotions '' -LRB- biologic side of the affect and lying in structures of the limbic system as the hippocampus and the amygdaloid complex -RRB- and '' feelings emotions '' -LRB- psychologic side of the affect -RRB- .

1480730|One of these circuits , the limbic-thalamo-cortical circuit , which includes the amygdala , the medio-dorsal thalamus , and parts of the ventral and medial prefrontal cortex , may be engaged in abnormal reverberatory activity that maintains the cognitive and emotional set of depression .

1345179|The amygdala is assumed to connect sensory experiences , including stressful stimuli , with the emotional reactions and gastrointestinal effects normally produce .

1815147|These projections may allow diverse auditory signals to act on common ensembles of amygdaloid neurons and may therefore play a role in the integration of sensory messages leading to emotional reactions .

1667743|Stimulation of the amygdala in rats is known to elicit increases in heart rate -LRB- HR -RRB- and blood pressure -LRB- BP -RRB- as well as locomotor activity associated with emotional arousal .

1786555|The kindling-elicited sensitization of mesolimbic DA reward functioning seen after amphetamine challenge was discussed in relation to the role of the central amygdala in the integration of stimulus-reward associations , and in the conditioning of affective emotional states .

1837592|Patients with Alzheimer 's disease -LRB- AD -RRB- often show emotional , motivational , and memory disturbances which may have morphological substrates that include the amygdaloid complex .

1669294|Independence of memory functions and emotional behavior : separate contributions of the hippocampal formation and the amygdala . .

1669294|Partial or complete damage to the amygdaloid complex affected emotional behavior but not memory .

1908584|According to one formulation of the behavioural functions of 5HT , aversive conditioned stimuli mediate their behavioural and emotional effects through activation of 5HT projections from dorsal raphe nucleus to receptors of the 5HT2 family in amygdala and elsewhere .

1717305|Projections from the acoustic thalamus to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- AL -RRB- have been implicated in the formation of emotional memories .

1706363|The central nucleus of the amygdala has been implicated in a variety of emotional/cognitive functions ranging from fear and orienting responses , defensive and aversive reactions , associative conditioning , cardiovascular regulation , and antinociception .

2096322|Dependence of electrical activity of the amygdaloid complex on level of motivation and emotional state of the dog . .

2082507|The findings indicate that the inferotemporal cortex plays a critical role in visual perception , cognition and memory , whereas the amygdala is involved fundamentally in controlling emotional and motivational behavior .

2082507|However , the amygdala is concerned with vision in the following ways : It receives neutral visual information highly processed in the visual cortex , invests the information with emotional and motivational significance through interactions with the cortical and subcortical systems of emotion and motivation , and then it returns the information coded to the visual areas to be re-processed ; to be consciously perceived in area TEO , and to be meaningfully cognized , recognized and memorized in areas TE and TEG .

2082507|Therefore , two channel model regarding the mechanism of visual information processing in the inferotemporal cortex is proposed : A first channel is concerned with processing neutral information , while the second one , with processing meaning information coded emotionally and motivationally in the amygdala .

2400920|In addition , they are in good agreement with the involvement of the amygdala in emotional , autonomic and/or behavioral reactions to noxious events .

2329367|Previous work has implicated projections from the acoustic thalamus to the amygdala in the classical conditioning of emotional responses to auditory stimuli .

2329367|The purpose of the present studies was to determine whether the lateral amygdaloid nucleus -LRB- AL -RRB- , which is a major subcortical target of projections from the acoustic thalamus , might be the sensory interface of the amygdala in emotional conditioning .

2329367|AL is thus an essential link in the circuitry through which auditory stimuli are endowed with affective properties and may function as the sensory interface of the amygdala during emotional learning .

2158523|Projections from the posterior thalamus to the amygdala have been implicated in the processing of the emotional significance of acoustic stimuli .

2310319|The patient had significant defects in nonverbal visual memory , in social behavior , and in '' executive control '' functions , findings consistent with the proposal , based on experimental animal work , that the amygdala plays important roles in memory and in the modulation of social and emotional behavior .

2167033|Aversive events provide sensory information , which is integrated primarily by the limbic system -LRB- e.g. , amygdala -RRB- and translated into the expression of emotional behavior and associated autonomic response patterns .

2131742|The 5,6-dihydroxytryptamine administration into the median raphe nucleus in the cat resulted in an increase in the carbachol-induced emotional-defensive behavior and a decrease of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and dopamine level in the hypothalamus , midbrain and amygdala .

2131742|Lesions of median raphe nucleus resulted in similar , but more subtle alterations of post-carbachol emotional-defensive response similarly to dorsal raphe nucleus lesions , and they had also different biochemical effects in the '' emotional regions '' of the brain -LRB- hypothalamus , midbrain , amygdala -RRB- .

1978927|In the amygdala , mesolimbic DA may serve to modulate processes that attach emotional significance to environmental stimuli ; further , DA may play a role in determining which stimuli gain access to structures afferent to the amygdala , including the nucleus accumbens .

2610920|Recent evidence suggests that the amygdaloid central nucleus -LRB- ACE -RRB- may contribute significantly to Pavlovian fear-conditioned bradycardic responses during the presentation of conditioned emotional stimuli .

2629385|-LSB- Dependence of the electrical activity of the amygdaloid complex on motivation level and emotional status in the dog -RSB- . .

2585785|Since the cortex , amygdala and hypothalamus has been shown to be closely associated with emotion and stress , it could be speculated that emotional changes and stress might induce the changes of excitability of DMN neurons via higher order neuronal systems .

2924962|-LSB- Hormonal homeostasis and intraocular pressure in chronic emotional stress caused by influences acting on the amygdala -RSB- . .

2854842|The purpose of the present study was to determine whether lesions of areas projected to by the central amygdaloid nucleus -LRB- ACE -RRB- would disrupt the classical conditioning of autonomic and/or behavioral emotional responses .

3355661|Electrophysiological activity in the central nucleus of the amygdala : emotionality and stress ulcers in rats . .

3355661|It was concluded that the unit activity in the central nucleus of the amygdala reflects certain emotionality characteristics of rats and also their susceptibility of stress ulcers .

2902539|Studies are reviewed which indicate that the multiple-unit activity of the central nucleus of the amygdala differentiates stress-susceptible from stress-resistant rats , highly emotional from less emotional animals , and genetically-selected Roman High-Avoidance and Low-Avoidance rats .

3663905|-LSB- Emotional behavior disorders in rats during the formation of a generator of pathologically enhanced excitation in the basomedial nuclei of the amygdaloid complex -RSB- . .

2889508|Cardiovascular responses elicited by stimulation of neurons in the central amygdaloid nucleus in awake but not anesthetized rats resemble conditioned emotional responses . .

2889508|The timing and pattern of the response elicited by electrical stimulation of the amygdala in the awake but not the anesthetized rat closely corresponds with that evoked by an acoustic conditioned emotional stimulus .

3314239|By comparison of motivational excitation with available stimuli or their engrams retrieved from memory with the participation of the temporal cortex , an emotional colouring of the stimuli and engrams is formed in the amygdala leading to isolation of a dominant motivation , destined to be satisfied in the first instance .

3297404|In the rat , the neural pathway mediating the coupling , through aversive emotional conditioning , of blood pressure responses to acoustic stimuli involves the transmission of sensory signals through the primary auditory projection system to the medial geniculate body , where the input is then relayed subcortically to the amygdala .

3297404|The amygdala , presumably by way of connections with the hypothalamus , and from there to the brainstem or spinal cord , controls the learned emotional response .

3297404|These findings , which implicate a largely unrecognized sensory relay to the amygdala in emotional learning , represent the first demonstration of a direct link between primary sensory system and autonomic control regions in the mammalian brain .

3614641|Recent evidence suggests that the amygdaloid central nucleus may contribute importantly to autonomic regulation during emotional states , possibly via both direct and indirect central nucleus efferent projections to autonomic regulatory nuclei in the lower brainstem .

3668238|These findings are discussed in relation to the amygdala 's role as a mediator between limbic and cortical processing , and in light of the right hemisphere 's specialization for emotional behaviors .

3768689|Intrinsic neurons in the amygdaloid field projected to by the medial geniculate body mediate emotional responses conditioned to acoustic stimuli . .

3768689|In previous experiments we implicated projections from the medial geniculate body -LRB- MG -RRB- to a subcortical field , involving portions of the posterior caudate-putamen and amygdala , in the classical conditioning of emotional responses to acoustic stimuli in the rat .

3768689|In the present series of experiments we examined whether intrinsic neurons in the subcortical field mediate emotional conditioning and , if so , whether the critical neurons are contained within the amygdala or the caudate-putamen .

2994825|Infusions of chlordiazepoxide into the lateral amygdala induced a release of responding measured during the component of a conditioned emotional response task previously associated with an aversive stimulus .

4041212|Recent evidence suggests that the amygdaloid central nucleus -LRB- ACE -RRB- may contribute importantly to cardiovascular adjustments in response to the presentation of conditioned emotional stimuli , possibly via direct ACE projections to cardiovascular regulatory nuclei in the medulla .

4040761|It was concluded that these areas of the amygdala respond to the emotional component of immobilization stress .

4022327|Evidence has recently been presented which demonstrates that the amygdaloid central nucleus projects directly upon cardiovascular/autonomic regulatory nuclei of the dorsal medulla and that in the rabbit this nucleus may influence cardiovascular activity during emotional states .

3994832|To investigate the functions of the amygdala in visual information processing and in emotional and social responses , recordings were made from single neurons in the amygdala of the monkey .

3994832|These neurons typically -LRB- 1 -RRB- responded to some human or monkey faces , which were presented to the monkey through a large aperture shutter so that response latencies could be measured , or were simply shown to the monkey , -LRB- 2 -RRB- responded to 2-dimensional representations of these faces , as well as to real 3-dimensional faces , -LRB- 3 -RRB- had no responses or only small -LRB- less than half maximum -RRB- responses to gratings , simple geometrical , other complex 3-D stimuli , or to arousing and aversive stimuli , -LRB- 4 -RRB- had response latencies of 110-200 ms , -LRB- 5 -RRB- were located in the basal accessory nucleus of the amygdala , -LRB- 6 -RRB- responded differently to different faces , as shown by measures of d' , and could thus over a population of such neurons code information useful for making different responses to different individuals , -LRB- 7 -RRB- could in some cases -LRB- 9/11 tested -RRB- respond to parts of faces , and -LRB- 8 -RRB- in a few cases -LRB- 4/19 tested -RRB- responded more to a face which produced an emotional response .

3994832|It is suggested that the deficits in social and emotional behavior produced by amygdala lesions could be due in part to damage to a neuronal system specialized in utilizing information from faces so that appropriate social and emotional responses can be made to different individuals .

3886288|In essence , it is argued that the human amygdala is responsible for activating or reactivating those mnemonic events which are of an emotional significance for the subjects ' life history and that this -LRB- re - -RRB- activation is performed by charging sensory information with appropriate emotional cues .

3860099|Auditory emotional memories : establishment by projections from the medial geniculate nucleus to the posterior neostriatum and/or dorsal amygdala . .

6522490|The results are discussed in terms of the possible role the amygdala may play in some of the proposed determining factors mediating consummatory negative contrast -LRB- e.g. , emotionality , neophobia , memory -RRB- .

6466978|This cortical influence was evoked by electrical stimulation of the cortical nucleus of amygdala -LRB- Aco -RRB- , and was very similar to coughing accompanying changes in emotional behavior and was depressed more effectively by psychotropics than by centrally acting antitussives like codeine .

6737042|It is worthy of investigation for its part in mediating CTAs in that it is sensitive to several physiological conditions which affect feeding while also being a site of anatomical convergence for vagal afferents from the viscera and centrifugal projections from areas -LRB- hypothalamus , amygdala -RRB- implicated in emotions and hedonics .

6495854|Coherence and spectral functions of biopotentials of the hippocampus , amygdala , frontal and sensorimotor cortical areas were estimated in dogs during instrumental alimentary behaviour and during self-stimulation of emotionally positive brain areas .

6715589|The anterior basolateral amygdala -LRB- which innervates via collaterals both the medial and lateral prefrontal subfields -RRB- may add a common input to either subfield , such as information on the significance of incoming stimuli to the animal 's behavior , while the mediodorsal nucleus -LRB- whose segments are principally connected to only one prefrontal subfield -RRB- may add segment-specific information , for example , of a spatial-cognitive nature for the lateral segment and of an emotional nature for the central and medial segments .

6707732|Our concurrent observation that MG projects to several subcortical areas -LRB- central and lateral amygdala ; caudate-putamen ; ventromedial hypothalamus -RRB- involved in emotional behavior and autonomic function suggests hypotheses concerning subsequent links in this emotional processing pathway .

6542912|In the process of experimental testing of ` the need-informational theory of emotions ' the role of different cerebral structures -LRB- frontal neocortex , hippocampus , amygdala , hypothalamus -RRB- in the genesis of emotional states and in the organization of goal-directed behavior was elucidated .

6526707|It is suggested that the importance of this type of neuron may be in the different emotional and social responses which occur to different faces , and which are disrupted by damage to the amygdala .

6666335|The increase of exogenous serotonin level in the amygdala phasically intensified the self-stimulation and activated emotionally negative forms of behaviour .

6871031|The results specifically suggest that the noradrenergic system of the amygdala is involved in the long-term processing of the emotional attributes of aversive information .

6613697|It has been concluded that amygdala plays an essential role in emotional-motivational mechanisms of predatory competitions as one of the forms of social behavior .

6545503|However , most of the observed group differences were related to a decrease of sensitivity to shock and to a lowered general emotionality produced by lesions in both amygdaloid nuclei .

7168349|It is further known that the limbic amygdala complex normally reinforces emotionally induced defence reactions .

7136269|Correlation between the '' frontal neocortex -- hypothalamus '' and '' hippocampus -- amygdala '' systems is manifested on the neuroticism -LRB- emotionality -RRB- scale .

6176906|The abundance of neuropeptides within the amygdala and their complex pattern imply that they may act to regulate endocrine responses to external events -LRB- e.g. stress -RRB- or alter emotional tone functions thought to be controlled by the amygdala .

7290753|Unlike the hypothalamus , the amygdala creates the balance , the dynamic coexistence , of competing needs -LRB- motivations -RRB- and emotions generated by such needs , which makes behavior more adequate .

7344421|The relationship of the '' frontal neocortex -- hypothalamus '' and '' hippocampus -- amygdala '' systems is reflected in the scale of neurotism -LRB- emotionality -RRB- .

7245915|Bilateral ablations of the basolateral part and medial nuclei of the amygdala in albino rats caused opposite changes in active avoidance acquisition and consolidation , emotional intensity level -LRB- fear -RRB- and '' open field '' activity .

7245915|In intact animals the basolateral part of the amygdala produced facilitation while medial nuclei caused inhibition of the shuttlebox avoidance reactions , aggressiveness and general '' emotionality '' -LRB- fear-motivated behaviour -RRB- .

7245911|In 15 patients with destruction of the amygdala complex and the hippocampus , changes in EEG and skin-galvanic reflex were recorded when they were imagining events inducing emotions and when they were anticipating nociceptive stimulation .

7245911|Bilateral lesion of the amygdala complex and the hippocampus brings about a decrease of the heart rate under the action of emotiogenic stimuli instead of its increase , and diminishes the difference between objective manifestations of positive and negative emotional states .

7219601|A possible role of the amygdaloid nuclei , basal ganglia , hypothalamus and their different pathways in regulation of somatic and autonomic functions and complex behavioural and emotional responses is discussed .

7006638|It was concluded that hypothalamus and amygdala lesioned nuclei play a role in the neural mediation of activity , while medial thalamus influences the mediation of emotional response .

7206359|This study indicates that there is a receptive field of pain in the amygdala which undoubtedly plays a role in emotion .

473899|The amygdala complx participates in creation of a balance , a dynamic co-existence between completing needs -LRB- motivations -RRB- and corresponding emotions .

300130|Chronic experiments on rabbits which had electrodes implanted into the hypothalamus , amygdalar area and hyppocampus have shown that electrostimulation of these brain structures which brought about different emotional and behavioral reactions during preliminary test produces a distinct modulating effect on the vestibular -LRB- rotatory and post-rotatory -RRB- nystagmus and labyrinthine posture-tonic reflexes .

986202|Stimulation of gastric receptors led to modulation of the emotional-behavioristic reactions induced by electric stimulation of the hypothalamus , the amygdala and the hypocampus .

944976|Bioelectrical activity of the limbic structures -LRB- amygdala , dorsal and ventral hippocampus -RRB- , the cortex and etologic responses during the formation of emotional stress of negative modality , were studied on Wistar rats under conditions of continuous many-hour neurotization .

944976|The established sequence in the involvement of the limbico-neocortical complex in the process of emotional stress with parallel use of the conditioned reflex to time , points to the participation of the hippocampus in the prediction of events -LRB- hippocampus leads to amygdala leads to cortex -RRB- .

943118|Increased glutamic acid and GABA levels , caused by lithium and rubidium , were found in brain structures -LRB- hypothalamus and amygdala -RRB- known to be involved in emotional behavior .

1208670|Alterations in behavior observed following hypothalamic ablations were related to septal and amygdaloid effects , and the possibility of separate projection systems for emotionality and social cohesiveness was discussed .
