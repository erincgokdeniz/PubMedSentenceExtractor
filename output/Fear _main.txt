27092057|The amygdala is a key player in the processing of fear .

27092057|Nonetheless , the impact of 5-HT on fear processing remains poorly understood.The aim of this review is to elucidate the physiological role of 5-HT in fear learning via its action on the neuronal circuits of the amygdala .

27092057|Since 5-HT release increases in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- during both fear memory acquisition and expression , we examine whether and how 5-HT neurons encode aversive stimuli and aversive cues .

27087745|Manipulation of neurotransmission within the amygdala affects the expression of conditioned and unconditioned emotional memories such as fear freezing behaviour .

27083303|Due to the additional neural circuitry required for contextual , but not auditory , fear conditioning , these data suggest that endocannabinoid signaling outside the amygdala may be critical for a subset of fearful memories .

27079132|Cocaine users showed hyperresponsiveness of the amygdala and insula during fear conditioning , as well as hyporesponsiveness of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex during extinction learning .

27077317|The amygdala is a key region for acquisition and expression of fear , and storage of fear and emotional memories .

27077317|Many lines of evidence suggest that the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- participates in different aspects of fear acquisition and extinction , but its precise connectivity with the amygdala is just starting to be understood .

27053114|In agreement with the changes in amygdala gene expression profiles , IP3K-A knockout -LRB- KO -RRB- mice displayed more robust responses to aversive stimuli and spent less time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze , indicating high levels of innate fear and anxiety .

27053114|In addition to behavioral phenotypes , decreased excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic current and reduced c-Fos immunoreactivity in the CeA of IP3K-A KO mice suggest that IP3K-A has a profound influence on the basal activities of fear - and anxiety-mediating amygdala circuitry .

27053075|Conjoint and convergent amygdalar input to EA , including BSTL , as well as to Ac subregions likely transmits fear and aggression related signals to both viscerolimbic -LRB- EA -RRB- and learned reward - and motivation-related -LRB- Ac -RRB- ventrobasal forebrain regions .

27039701|Our analyses revealed that rsFC of the left amygdala significantly differed between women and men : Women showed stronger rsFC than men between the left amygdala and left middle temporal gyrus , inferior frontal gyrus , postcentral gyrus and hippocampus , regions involved in face processing , inner-speech , fear and pain processing .

27019015|Using circuit-mapping techniques in mice , we define a disynaptic network originating from a subset of AgRP neurons that project to the medial nucleus of the amygdala and then to the principal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis , which suppresses territorial aggression and reduces contextual fear .

27014154|Psychopaths Show Enhanced Amygdala Activation during Fear Conditioning . .

27013684|The induction of panic anxiety provides further evidence that the amygdala is not required for the conscious experience of fear induced via interoceptive sensory channels .

27013104|Imaging data showed that functional connectivity between ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- and amygdala in the reminder group was greater than that in the no reminder group after fear memory reactivation .

27013104|More importantly , the functional connectivity between amygdala and vmPFC of the reminder group after fear memory reactivation was positively correlated with extinction effect .

26923505|Preclinical models reveal that stress-induced amygdala activity and impairment in fear extinction reflect reductions in anandamide driven by corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor type 1 -LRB- CRHR1 -RRB- potentiation of the anandamide catabolic enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase .

26918231|Our previous research on MPS IIIA identified autistic symptoms , and a Klüver-Bucy-type syndrome as indicated by reduced startle and loss of fear associated with amygdala atrophy .

26918231|Four evaluations were used : the Risk Room procedure -LRB- to measure social-emotional characteristics , especially fear and startle responses -RRB- , the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule -LRB- ADOS -RRB- , the Sanfilippo Behavior Rating Scale -LRB- SBRS -RRB- , and amygdala brain volumes calculated from manually-traced MRI images .

26882036|While the amygdala has long been considered a site of storage of fear memories , newer findings suggest that the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- is essential in the regulation of amygdala-dependent memories and fear expression .

26880136|Late Arc/Arg3 .1 expression in the basolateral amygdala is essential for persistence of newly-acquired and reactivated contextual fear memories . .

26880136|Here , we discover that late Arc -LRB- also known as Arg3 .1 -RRB- expression in the mouse basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is involved in persistence of newly-acquired and reactivated fear memories .

26878891|Most research on stress and psychiatric diseases has focused on the amygdala , which regulates immediate responses to fear .

26878674|Fear expression relies on the coordinated activity of prefrontal and amygdala circuits , yet the mechanisms allowing long-range network synchronization during fear remain unknown .

26876924|Whereas neuroanatomical studies indicate that the amygdala only has direct interconnections with the ventral hippocampal region , electrophysiological studies and behavioral studies investigating fear conditioning and extinction , as well as amygdalar modulation of hippocampal-dependent mnemonic functions , suggest that the amygdala interacts with dorsal hippocampal regions via relays in the parahippocampal cortices .

26875790|Maintenance of aversive memories shown by fear extinction-impaired phenotypes is associated with increased activity in the amygdaloid-prefrontal circuit . .

26875790|Basing on the a priori individuation of outliers , we demonstrated that the maintenance of aversive memories is linked to increased spinogenesis and excitatory signaling in the amygdala-prefrontal cortex fear matrix .

26859310|These findings provide unique insights into how perturbations in major amygdalar circuits could hamper fear regulation and drive excessive acquisition and expression of fear in PTSD .

26844540|Exogenously mimicking medial amygdala DNA hypomethylation resulted in reduction of fear to cat odors in uninfected animals , thus suggesting sufficiency .

26843989|Here we report data using C57BL/6 mice showing that the V -LRB- D -RRB- J recombination-activating gene 1 -LRB- RAG1 -RRB- , which encodes a factor that introduces DSBs in immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes , is induced in the amygdala , but not in the hippocampus , after context fear conditioning .

26843646|The present study examined neural activity in the higher-order auditory cortex Te2 and basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and their crosstalk during the recall of recent and remote fear memories .

26820636|Interplay between serotonin and cannabinoid function in the amygdala in fear conditioning . .

26820636|In view of the key role of the amygdala in the acquisition and expression of fear memory , we investigated the involvement of basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- serotonin 5-HT4 receptors in arachidonylcyclopropylamide -LRB- ACPA ; selective CB1 cannabinoid receptor agonist -RRB- - induced fear memory consolidation impairment .

26820587|The current experiments examine the ontogeny of fear conditioning and relate it to neuronal activation assessed through immediate early gene -LRB- IEG -RRB- expression in the amygdala , hippocampus , perirhinal cortex , and hypothalamus of periweanling rats .

26820587|qRT-PCR results suggest specific activation of the amygdala only in older subjects during auditory fear expression .

26820587|Overall , the development of fear conditioning occurring between the third and fourth weeks of life appears to be at least partly attributable to changes in activation of the amygdala and perirhinal cortex during fear conditioning or expression .

26791254|Brain-injured mice exhibited a decreased threat response in a cued fear conditioning paradigm , congruent with a decrease in amygdala excitability determined with basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- field excitatory post-synaptic potentials together with voltage-sensitive dye imaging -LRB- VSD -RRB- .

26758831|Disrupted Prediction Error Links Excessive Amygdala Activation to Excessive Fear . .

26758831|Basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is critical for fear learning , and its heightened activation is widely thought to underpin a variety of anxiety disorders .

26758831|Here we combined chemogenetic excitation of rat basolateral amygdala glutamatergic neurons with a variety of behavioral approaches to show that , although simple fear learning is unaffected , the use of prediction error to regulate this learning is profoundly disrupted , leading to formation of inappropriate fear associations and impaired fear inhibition .

26748024|Long-term memory -LRB- LTM -RRB- of fear stores activity dependent modifications that include changes in amygdala signaling .

26748024|Lastly , blocking mGluR-PLD in the rat amygdala was sufficient to prevent behavioral expression of fear memory .

26746182|While autonomous measures -LRB- fear-potentiated startle -RRB- provided only suggestive evidence for a modulatory role of NOS1-ex1f-VNTR on -LRB- contextual -RRB- fear conditioning processes , neural activation at the amygdala/anterior hippocampus junction was significantly increased in short-allele carriers during context conditioning .

26741286|Although caution is warranted , our findings tentatively suggest that OT has the potential to diminish anxiety and fear expression of the amygdala in PTSD , either via increased control of the vmPFC over the CeM -LRB- males -RRB- or via decreased salience processing of the dACC and BLA -LRB- females -RRB- .

26733838|Plasticity of Fear and Safety Neurons of the Amygdala in Response to Fear Extinction . .

26733838|Using a discriminative fear , safety , and reward conditioning task , Sangha et al. -LRB- 2013 -RRB- have previously reported several neural microcircuits within the basal amygdala -LRB- BA -RRB- which discriminate among these cues , including a subpopulation of neurons responding selectively to a safety cue and not a fear cue .

26725834|Activation of noradrenergic circuitry in the basolateral amygdala is thought to have a role in stress , fear , and anxiety , and the specific cell and receptor types responsible is an active area of investigation .

26711494|The associated learning signals-the learned associability and prediction error-were correlated with fMRI brain responses in amygdala-striatal regions , corresponding to the classic aversive -LRB- fear -RRB- learning circuit .

26707710|Survivors of TBI often experience cognitive and emotional deficits , suggesting that long-term effects of injury may disrupt neuronal function in critical brain regions , including the amygdala , which is involved in emotion and fear memory .

26698395|Modulation of cannabinoid signaling by amygdala ?2-adrenergic system in fear conditioning . .

26698395|Considering the importance of these systems in forming memories for fearful events , we have investigated the involvement of basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- ?2-adrenoceptors on ACPA -LRB- as selective cannabinoid CB1 agonist -RRB- - induced inhibition of the acquisition of contextual and auditory conditioned fear .

26678871|Several lines of evidence suggest that the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- are differentially involved in phasic and sustained fear .

26674344|Dopamine-dependent synaptic plasticity in an amygdala inhibitory circuit controls fear memory expression . .

26673928|In particular , recognition of fear was negatively correlated with the volume of amygdala , disgust with pallidum , and happiness with fusiform gyrus .

26670947|During processing of fear and anger faces , greater amygdala and less right dorsolateral prefrontal -LRB- dlPFC -RRB- activation partially mediated the positive relationship between CEM and anxiety symptoms .

26655466|Anxiety is associated with activation in ventromedial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus , while fear is associated with activation in periaqueductal gray , with amygdala involved in processing aspects of both emotional responses .

26651008|Anxiety disorders are associated with alterations in fear neurocircuitry such that ` bottom-up ' processes in the amygdala which respond to threat are exaggerated , and regulation of these processes by the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- and hippocampus is impaired .

26651008|Chronic stress exposure similarly alters fear neurocircuitry by enhancing amygdalar functioning while causing structural degeneration in the PFC and hippocampus thereby inhibiting PFC/hippocampus control over the stress response .

26650182|Although phylogenetically predisposed to handle fear , the amygdala handles both aversive and positive emotional inputs .

26586578|Activation of fear circuitry -LRB- amygdala , periaqueductal gray , granular insular -RRB- was seen in control animals ; however , activation of this circuitry was absent in BDNF -LRB- + / - -RRB- animals .

26582975|Post-training activation of Rac1 in the basolateral amygdala is required for the formation of both short-term and long-term auditory fear memory . .

26582975|Conditional knockout of Rac1 before associative fear training in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , a key area for fear memory acquisition and storage , impaired fear memory .

26578902|Convergent evidence from human and rodent studies supports a role for the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- - amygdala network in both PTSD and the regulation of fear memory expression .

26578902|In particular , current models stipulate that the prelimbic -LRB- PL -RRB- and infralimbic -LRB- IL -RRB- subdivisions of the rodent mPFC bidirectionally regulate fear expression via differential recruitment of amygdala neuronal subpopulations .

26578871|Yet , imaging studies continue to indicate a role for the superior colliculus and pulvinar nucleus in fear activation , despite disconnects in how these brain structures communicate not only with each other but with the amygdala .

26576733|More importantly , there was much stronger functional connectivity between the amygdala and vmPFC in the fear reminder group than those in the no reminder group .

26576733|These findings suggest that the strong functional connectivity between vmPFC and amygdala following a fear reminder could serve as a key role in the followed-up fear extinction stages , which may contribute to the erasing of fear memory .

26564090|Patients with lipoid proteinosis therefore have been used as models for demonstrating physiologic and pathologic abnormalities of the amygdala with respect to fear processing , affect and cognition , anxiety and memory .

26557051|However , in lampreys and their putative forerunners , the hagfishes , the striatum , which is the input part of this EPS , probably corresponds to the human centromedial amygdala , which in higher vertebrates is part of a system mediating fear and anxiety .

26527537|A-allele versus GG-carriers in rs1049353 displayed earlier recognition of facial expressions changing from anger to sadness or fear , but not for expressions changing from happiness to sadness or fear , and higher brain responses to angry , but not neutral , faces in the amygdala and insula .

26525920|Ictal symptoms such as fear , dreamy states -LRB- déjà vu , memory flashbacks , experiential hallucinations -RRB- , epigastric auras , or sympathetic outflow with cardiovascular changes are often linked to a seizure focus in the amygdala .

26525920|Of particular interest is the reduction in amygdala volume in conjunction with ictal fear , seizure focus in the amygdala , and amygdala and hippocampal sclerosis in TLE patients .

26524504|Increased tone-offset response in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala underlies trace fear conditioning . .

26524504|Accumulating evidence suggests that the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- stores associative memory in the form of enhanced neural response to the sensory input following classical fear conditioning in which the conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- and the unconditioned stimulus -LRB- US -RRB- are presented in a temporally continuous manner .

26523857|In addition , increased numbers of neurons were found in the basolateral amygdala of the high CPP mice , a key brain center for anxiety and fear responses .

26522869|While limited by a lack of a control group , these preliminary results suggest that pre-treatment amygdala reactivity to fear stimuli , a component of neurocircuitry models of PTSD , positively predicts symptom reduction during TF-CBT among assaulted adolescent girls , providing support for an objective measure for forecasting treatment response in this vulnerable population .

26499255|Implications of newborn amygdala connectivity for fear and cognitive development at 6-months-of-age . .

26499255|While animal models have revealed developmental changes in amygdala circuitry accompanying emerging fear , human neural systems involved in early fear development remain poorly understood .

26499255|We , therefore , examined amygdala functional connectivity with rs-fcMRI in 48 neonates -LRB- M = 3.65 weeks , SD = 1.72 -RRB- , and measured fear and cognitive development at 6-months-of-age .

26499255|Stronger , positive neonatal amygdala connectivity to several regions , including bilateral anterior insula and ventral striatum , was prospectively associated with higher fear at 6-months .

26499255|Stronger amygdala connectivity to ventral anterior cingulate/anterior medial prefrontal cortex predicted a specific phenotype of higher fear combined with more advanced cognitive development .

26499255|Overall , findings demonstrate unique profiles of neonatal amygdala functional connectivity related to emerging fear and cognitive development , which may have implications for normative and pathological fear in later years .

26497912|In line with the self-report , the fMRI data showed similar activation -LRB- including the amygdala -RRB- in both groups during disgust and fear elicitation .

26490062|It has been shown that BDNF in the hippocampus and amygdala participates in the formation of fear memory .

26487807|The neural circuitry of fear processing involves the amygdala , anterior cingulate , and insular cortex , while cortico-striatal-thalamic circuitry plays a key role in obsessive-compulsive disorder .

26486933|Results suggest delay EBC proceeds through three stages : in stage one the amygdala rapidly excites diffuse fear responses and PN acoustic reactivity , facilitating cerebellar synaptic plasticity and the development of eyeblink CRs in stage two , leading , in stage three , to a diminution or stabilization of conditioned fear responding .

26476009|Pharmacological depletion of serotonin in the basolateral amygdala complex reduces anxiety and disrupts fear conditioning . .

26476009|The basolateral and lateral amygdala nuclei complex -LRB- BLC -RRB- is implicated in a number of emotional responses including conditioned fear and social anxiety .

26454711|Thus NPY act as a resilience factor by impairing associative implicit memory after stressful and aversive events , as evident in models of fear conditioning , presumably via Y1 receptors in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex .

26444585|Preliminary evidence suggests that NPY modulates fear in particular by activation of Y1 and Y2 receptors in the basolateral and central amygdala , respectively .

26444585|In particular the inhibition of long-range central amygdala output neurons may result in a Y2 receptor-dependent suppression of fear .

26440730|Considering the known role of amygdala PKA pathways in fear learning and mood these observations suggest a possible mechanism through which allelic changes in the regulation of the BICC1 gene in amygdala neurones may contribute to mood disorders .

26412489|GABAergic signaling in the amygdala controls learned fear , and its dysfunction potentially contributes to posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- .

26412489|We find that sub-threshold fear conditioning leads to dopamine receptor D4-dependent long-term depression -LRB- LTD -RRB- of glutamatergic excitatory synapses by increasing inhibitory inputs onto neurons of the dorsal intercalated cell mass -LRB- ITC -RRB- in the amygdala .

26412489|These findings reveal a novel role of inhibitory circuits in the amygdala , which serves to dampen and restrict the level of fear expression .

26408574|Results of EEG event-related potential -LRB- ERP -RRB- experiments support the theory that impaired amygdala function may be responsible for abnormal fear processing in psychopathy , which can ultimately manifest as psychopathic traits , as outlined by the PCL-R or PPI-R .

26400259|It has been proposed that the central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , particularly its medial sector -LRB- CeM -RRB- , generates brief fear responses to discrete conditioned cues , whereas the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- promotes long-lasting , anxiety-like states in response to more diffuse contingencies .

26388257|Our results suggest that two different sub-regions of the amygdala and their respective neural networks are affected in OCD : the superficial amygdala and networks related to evaluation of reinforcers and risk anticipation and the basolateral amygdala which is implicated in fear processing .

26388257|The diminished CBT response in patients showing a lower degree centrality of the basolateral amygdala reflects a deficient fear circuit in these patients which may impact fear extinction as a core mechanism of exposure-based CBT .

26384653|Acute food deprivation enhances fear extinction but inhibits long-term depression in the lateral amygdala via ghrelin signaling . .

26384653|Fear memory-encoding thalamic input synapses to the lateral amygdala -LRB- T-LA -RRB- exhibit dynamic efficacy changes that are tightly correlated with fear memory strength .

26383032|We trained C57/Bl6 mice in trace and contextual fear conditioning protocols , and examined editing levels at GRIK1 and GluA2 Q/R sites in the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- and hippocampus -LRB- CA1 and CA3 -RRB- , at two time points after training .

26383032|Animals trained in the trace fear conditioning protocol exhibited a transient increase in unedited GRIK1 RNA in the amygdala , and their learning efficiency correlated with unedited RNA levels in CA1 .

26379513|Earlier work has identified possible subcortical and cortical fear pathways known as the '' low road '' and '' high road , '' which arrive at the amygdala independently .

26373831|The results were discussed in terms of a dual systems explanation of context fear conditioning : a hippocampal-dependent process that forms a unitary representation of context and an amygdala-based process which associates this representation with shock .

26366635|The amygdala may be best known for its role in the acquisition and expression of conditioned fear , but it also supports the perception and recognition of others ' fear .

26366635|They include theories that amygdala responses to fearful expressions 1 -RRB- reflect heightened vigilance in response to uncertain danger , 2 -RRB- promote heightened attention to the eye region of faces , 3 -RRB- represent a response to an unconditioned aversive stimulus , or 4 -RRB- reflect the generation of an empathic fear response .

26366635|Among these , only empathic fear explains why amygdala lesions would impair fear recognition across modalities .

26366635|Supporting the possibility of a link between fundamental empathic processes and amygdala responses to fear is evidence that impaired fear recognition in psychopathic individuals results from amygdala dysfunction , whereas enhanced fear recognition in altruistic individuals results from enhanced amygdala function .

26363777|These findings provide preliminary support for the construct validity of the fearlessness and disinhibition temperament dimensions and offer confirmatory evidence for involvement of the amygdala and hippocampus in fear conditioning and behavioral inhibition , respectively .

26354895|Research on reconsolidation was revitalized only more than a decade ago with the demonstration of reconsolidation in a well-defined behavioral protocol -LRB- auditory fear conditioning in the rat -RRB- subserved by an identified brain circuit -LRB- basolateral amygdala -RRB- .

26338326|Incubation of Fear Is Regulated by TIP39 Peptide Signaling in the Medial Nucleus of the Amygdala . .

26338326|PTH2R knock-out mice had significantly reduced c-Fos activation in the medial amygdala -LRB- MeA -RRB- following both footshock and fear recall , but had normal activation in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus and the amygdalar central nucleus compared with wild-type .

26338326|This work shows that modulatory processes within the medial nucleus of the amygdala near the time of a traumatic event influence the strength of fear responses that occur much later .

26328883|The Physiology of Fear : Reconceptualizing the Role of the Central Amygdala in Fear Learning . .

26328883|The historically understood role of the central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- in fear learning is to serve as a passive output station for processing and plasticity that occurs elsewhere in the brain .

26328883|The classical role of the CeA as a routing station to fear effector brain structures like the periaqueductal gray , the lateral hypothalamus , and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus will be briefly reviewed , but specific emphasis is placed on recent literature suggesting that the CeA 1 -RRB- has an important role in the plasticity underlying fear learning , 2 -RRB- is involved in regulation of other amygdala subnuclei , and 3 -RRB- is itself regulated by intra - and extra-amygdalar input .

26322928|Our findings reveal that the neuronal circuits that mediate fear and anxiety overlap at the level of defined subpopulations of central amygdala neurons and demonstrate that persistent changes in the excitability of a single cell type can orchestrate complex behavioral changes .

26318493|We found that contextual fear memory consolidation induced JunB expression in the medial nucleus and intercalated cells of the amygdala while extinction training induced JunB in the CA1 and CA3 areas of the dorsal hippocampus .

26318493|Thus , our data suggest that JunB expression in the medial nucleus and intercalated cells of the amygdala is involved in fear memory consolidation while alphaCaMKII-autophosphorylation-dependent JunB expression in the areas CA1 and CA3 of the dorsal hippocampus regulates fear memory extinction .

26314208|NPY Y2 receptors in the central amygdala reduce cued but not contextual fear . .

26314208|The amygdala is fundamental for associative fear and extinction learning .

26300273|These studies suggest that the multiple roles of oxytocin in social and fear behavior are due to its local effects in various brain areas , most notably distinct regions of the amygdala .

26294108|Studies of fear acquisition suggest that regions such as amygdala , insula , anterior cingulate cortex , and hippocampus play an important role in acquisition of fear , whereas studies of fear extinction suggest that the amygdala is also crucial for safety learning .

26287369|Despite a strong focus on the role of the amygdala in fear conditioning , recent works point to a more distributed network supporting fear conditioning .

26287369|Using thalamus and amygdala as seed-regions , directed functional connectivity was calculated to capture the modulation of interactions that underlie fear conditioning .

26287369|Importantly , this analysis showed that the thalamus drives the fusiform area during fear conditioning , while amygdala captures the more general effect of fearful faces perception .

26282370|Our results suggest that zif268 within the amygdala participates in the DCS facilitation effect on the extinction of conditioned fear .

26271722|Sonic hedgehog signaling regulates amygdalar neurogenesis and extinction of fear memory . .

26271722|In the present study , we investigated the relationship between neurogenesis in the amygdala and extinction of fear memory .

26271722|These results suggest that amygdala neurogenesis and Shh signaling are involved in the extinction of fear memory .

26260664|Specifically , we review consistent behavioral , electrophysiological , pharmacological , biochemical and imaging data unveiling a direct contribution of both the amygdala and hippocampal-septal system to the identification of the predictor of a threat in different situations of fear conditioning .

26260664|Hence , beyond the mutual quantitative regulation of these two brain systems described so far , we develop the idea that different activations of the hippocampus and amygdala , leading to specific configurations of neural activity , qualitatively impact the formation of emotional memory representations , thereby producing either adaptive or maladaptive fear memories .

26248536|Both dorsal raphe serotonergic activity during aversive reinforcement and amygdala serotonin 2C receptor -LRB- 5-HT2CR -RRB- activity during memory consolidation were necessary for stress enhancement of fear memory , but neither process affected fear memory in unstressed mice .

26239291|Previously , we reported a promising finding that storage of memories associated with methamphetamine -LRB- METH -RRB- , but not memories for fear or food reward , is vulnerable to disruption by actin depolymerization in the basolateral amygdala complex -LRB- BLC -RRB- .

26238968|However , we found evidence indicative of reduced neural activity , measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- , in the l-DOPA group in areas related to conditioned fear and return of fear -LRB- amygdala , posterior hippocampus -RRB- and enhanced activity in a key area of extinction retrieval/expression -LRB- ventromedial prefrontal cortex -RRB- , relative to placebo controls .

26228348|Propranolol decreases retention of fear memory by modulating the stability of surface glutamate receptor GluA1 subunits in the lateral amygdala . .

26228348|We investigated the action of propranolol on the retention of conditioned fear memory , the surface expression of glutamate receptor GluA1 subunits of AMPA receptors and synaptic adaptation in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- of rats .

26227545|Throughout life , fear learning is indispensable for survival and neural plasticity in the lateral amygdala underlies this learning and storage of fear memories .

26227545|During development , properties of fear learning continue to change into adulthood , but currently little is known about changes in amygdala circuits that enable these behavioural transitions .

26227545|Convergent evidence suggests that plasticity in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- participates in acquisition and storage of fear memory .

26225843|In amygdala and hippocampus , GluN1 protein expressions decreased 72h after the fear conditioning in the traumatic stress group suggesting a possible down-regulation of NMDARs .

26220745|Animal studies suggest that the neural circuitry responsible fear renewal includes the hippocampus , amygdala , and dorsomedial -LRB- dmPFC -RRB- and ventromedial -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- prefrontal cortex .

26220745|We used functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- , combined with psychophysiology and immersive virtual reality , to elucidate how the hippocampus , amygdala , and dmPFC and vmPFC interact to drive the context-dependent renewal of extinguished fear .

26220745|Structural equation modeling revealed that the dmPFC fully mediated the effect of the hippocampus on right amygdala activity during fear renewal , whereas the vmPFC partially mediated the effect of the hippocampus on right amygdala activity during extinction recall .

26214213|This reduced social behavior may be due to glutamatergic dysfunction within the amygdala , leading to increased fear and social anxiety .

26194914|It also increased c-Fos expression in the prelimbic prefrontal cortex , paraventricular thalamus , and the central and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala , areas implicated in the retrieval of fear memories .

26190833|In contrast , both acquisition and long-term retention of cued and trace fear memories were impaired in mdx mice , suggesting alteration in a functional circuit including the amygdala .

26182988|Viral delivery of shRNA to amygdala neurons leads to neurotoxicity and deficits in Pavlovian fear conditioning . .

26182988|Here we report the results of a series of experiments where adeno-associated viruses -LRB- AAV -RRB- , that were engineered to express shRNAs designed to target known plasticity associated genes -LRB- i.e. Arc , Egr1 and GluN2A -RRB- or control shRNAs that were designed not to target any rat gene product for depletion , were delivered to the rat basal and lateral nuclei of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , and auditory Pavlovian fear conditioning was examined .

26179507|In conclusion , studies of the hypothalamic parvafox nucleus will reveal whether this entity represents the fulcrum for positive emotions , as is the amygdala for fear and the insula for disgust .

26179231|Tracking the fear memory engram : discrete populations of neurons within amygdala , hypothalamus , and lateral septum are specifically activated by auditory fear conditioning . .

26179231|We have previously used fos-tau-lacZ -LRB- FTL -RRB- transgenic mice to identify discrete populations of neurons in amygdala and hypothalamus , which were specifically activated by fear conditioning to a context .

26179231|Discrete populations of learning-specific neurons were identified in only a small number of locations in the brain , including those previously found to be activated in amygdala and hypothalamus by context fear conditioning .

26179152|Calcitonin gene-related peptide erases the fear memory and facilitates long-term potentiation in the central nucleus of the amygdala in rats . .

26179152|CGRP and CGRP1 receptors are enriched in central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , the main part of the amygdala , which regulates conditioned fear memories .

26179152|Our electrophysiological and behavioral in vitro and in vivo results showed exogenous application of CGRP induced an immediate and lasting long-term potentiation in the basolateral nucleus of amygdala-CeA pathway , but not in the lateral nucleus of amygdala-CeA pathway , while bilateral intra-CeA infusion CGRP -LRB- 0 , 5 , 13 and 21 ?M / side -RRB- dose dependently enhanced fear memory extinction .

26179152|These results demonstrate that CGRP can lead to long-term potentiation of basolateral nucleus of amygdala-CeA pathway through a PKA-dependent postsynaptic mechanism that involved N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors and enhance the extinction of fear memory in rats .

26179152|Calcitonin gene-related peptide -LRB- CGRP -RRB- plays an essential role in synaptic plasticity in the amygdala and fear memory .

26179152|We found that CGRP-induced chemical long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- in a dose-dependent way in the BLA-CeA -LRB- basolateral and central nucleus of amygdala , respectively -RRB- pathway and enhanced fear memory extinction in rats through a protein kinase A -LRB- PKA -RRB- - dependent postsynaptic mechanism that involved NMDA receptors .

26174596|Dexamethasone Treatment Leads to Enhanced Fear Extinction and Dynamic Fkbp5 Regulation in Amygdala . .

26174294|These findings raise the possibility that amygdala-dependent fear systems may remain intact even when a patient has diminished memory of events .

26171717|Specifically , dACC hyperactivation is consistent with abnormal promotion of fear responses , whereas reduced amygdala-mPFC connectivity suggests impaired regulation of amygdala responses to threat .

26161254|Intolerance of uncertainty predicts fear extinction in amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortical circuitry . .

26161254|In late extinction learning , low IU scores were associated with successful inhibition of previously learned threat , reflected in comparable skin conductance response and right amgydala activity to learned threat vs. safety cues , whilst high IU scores were associated with continued fear expression to learned threat , indexed by larger skin conductance and amygdala activity to threat vs. safety cues .

26151925|The neurokinin-1 -LRB- NK1 -RRB- receptor is abundantly expressed in the fear circuitry of the brain , including the amygdala , where it modulates stress and anxiety .

26136671|The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus -LRB- PVT -RRB- projects to the central nucleus of the amygdala and recent experimental evidence indicates a role for the PVT in conditioned fear .

26132145|Disruption of Memory Reconsolidation Erases a Fear Memory Trace in the Human Amygdala : An 18-Month Follow-Up . .

26132145|Using functional magnetic resonance imaging we recently showed that reactivation and reconsolidation of a conditioned fear memory trace in the basolateral amygdala predicts subsequent fear expression over two days , while reactivation followed by disrupted reconsolidation abolishes the memory trace and suppresses fear .

26132145|In this follow-up study we demonstrate that the behavioral effect persists over 18 months reflected in superior reacquisition after undisrupted , as compared to disrupted reconsolidation , and that neural activity in the basolateral amygdala representing the initial fear memory predicts return of fear .

26132145|We conclude that disrupting reconsolidation have long lasting behavioral effects and may permanently erase the fear component of an amygdala-dependent memory .

26131556|ENU-induced and genome-edited null mutations in mice produce deficits in vestibular function , fear learning and circadian behavior , which correlated with Nmf9 expression in inner ear , amygdala , and suprachiasmatic nuclei .

26118841|Forebrain NR2B overexpression enhancing fear acquisition and long-term potentiation in the lateral amygdala . .

26118841|N-methyl-d-aspartic acid -LRB- NMDA -RRB- receptor-dependent long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- at the thalamus-lateral amygdala -LRB- T-LA -RRB- synapses is the basis for acquisition of auditory fear memory .

26115440|Whereas increased amygdala activity has been associated with phasic fear , sustained anxiety has been linked with activation of the bed nucleus of stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- , anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , and the insula .

26115440|Phobic patients revealed significantly higher amygdala activation than controls under conditions of phasic fear .

26089770|Animals were tested for sociability , nociception , stereotypy , fear conditioning and anxiety , and for tissue content of glutamate signaling proteins in the primary somatosensory cortex , hippocampus and amygdala , and of corticosterone in plasma , amygdala and hippocampus .

26081171|mGluR2/3 in the Lateral Amygdala is Required for Fear Extinction : Cortical Input Synapses onto the Lateral Amygdala as a Target Site of the mGluR2/3 Action . .

26081171|Subsequently , on the basis of a previous finding that a long-term potentiation of presynaptic efficacy at cortical input synapses onto the lateral amygdala -LRB- C-LA synapses -RRB- supports conditioned fear , we tested the hypothesis that activation of mGluR2/3 leads to fear extinction via a long-term weakening of presynaptic functions at C-LA synapses .

26079070|Our data indicate that the amygdaloid histaminergic system could modulate anxiety-related behaviors in the EPM and impair the retrieval process in fear conditioning with a strong aversive stimulus .

26074792|Contextual fear conditioning is thought to involve the synaptic plasticity-dependent establishment in hippocampus of representations of to-be-conditioned contexts which can then become associated with USs in the amygdala .

26062788|We eliminated new information during retrieval by manipulating animals ' training experience and measured changes in proteasome activity and GluR2 expression in the amygdala , two established markers of fear memory lability and reconsolidation .

26062788|We found that eliminating new contextual information during the retrieval of memories for predictable and unpredictable fear associations prevented changes in proteasome activity and glutamate receptor expression in the amygdala , indicating that this new information drives the reconsolidation of both predictable and unpredictable fear associations on retrieval .

26062787|Hunger Promotes Fear Extinction by Activation of an Amygdala Microcircuit . .

26062787|A marked increase in feed-forward inhibition between the basolateral and central amygdala has been proposed as a synaptic correlate of fear extinction and involves activation of the medial intercalated cells .

26057047|Rapgef6 deletion resulted in impaired amygdala function measured as reduced fear conditioning and anxiolysis .

26057047|Neural activation measured by cFOS phosphorylation demonstrated a reduction in hippocampal and amygdala activation after fear conditioning , while neural morphology assessment uncovered reduced spine density and primary dendrite number in pyramidal neurons of the CA3 hippocampal region of knockout mice .

26052039|Increased Serotonin Transporter Expression Reduces Fear and Recruitment of Parvalbumin Interneurons of the Amygdala . .

26052039|Mice overexpressing the 5-HTT -LRB- 5-HTTOE -RRB- , an animal model of this human variation , show impaired fear , together with reduced fear-evoked theta oscillations in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

26051817|SWR/J mice did not develop conditioned fear but exhibited increased transcriptional expression of Pdyn and Penk in the amygdala region .

26041829|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is a complex brain region associated with processing emotional states , such as fear , anxiety , and stress .

26022262|Indeed we have found that inhibiting amygdala -LRB- AMY -RRB- actin polymerization immediately or twenty-four hours prior to testing disrupted methamphetamine -LRB- METH -RRB- - associated memories , but not food reward or fear memories .

26007149|In response to overt fear , BPD patients showed greater activation both in left amygdala and in several frontal cortical regions .

26007149|These findings add to prior reports suggesting increased amygdala activation in BPD , but we found this only in the overt fear versus fixation condition .

25988357|ASIC-dependent LTP at multiple glutamatergic synapses in amygdala network is required for fear memory . .

25988357|Both fear learning and activity-induced long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- of cortico-basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- synapses are impaired in ASIC1a-null mice , suggesting a critical role of ASICs in fear memory formation .

25988357|Importantly , selective deletion of ASIC1a in GABAergic cells , including amygdala output neurons , eliminated LTP in these cells and reduced fear learning to the same extent as that found when ASIC1a was selectively abolished in BLA glutamatergic neurons .

25988357|Thus , fear learning requires ASIC-dependent LTP at multiple amygdala synapses , including both cortico-BLA input synapses and intra-amygdala synapses on output neurons .

25972162|The amygdala is a key region for the processing of information underlying fear , anxiety , and fear extinction .

25969533|Although the amygdala is often directly linked with fear and emotion , amygdala neurons are activated by a wide variety of emotional and non-emotional stimuli .

25969533|To test this hypothesis , we measured and compared the effects of novelty and fear on amygdala activity .

25943794|The amygdala , implicated in fear processing , was activated to a greater degree in the PG than in the UG in response to the CS .

25936641|Increased GABAergic Efficacy of Central Amygdala Projections to Neuropeptide S Neurons in the Brainstem During Fear Memory Retrieval . .

25936641|The canonical view on the central amygdala has evolved from a simple output station towards a highly organized microcircuitry , in which types of GABAergic neurons in centrolateral -LRB- CeL -RRB- and centromedial -LRB- CeM -RRB- subnuclei regulate fear expression and generalization .

25936641|Thereby , this pathway provides a possible feedback mechanism between amygdala and brainstem routes involved in fear and stress coping .

25936549|However , in each case , this c-Fos increase was observed within the same subnuclei of the medial amygdala and ventromedial hypothalamus , regions implicated in fear , anxiety , and defensive behaviors .

25934035|The basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , but not the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- , participated in the fear response elicited by the 3-s CS , whereas both the BLA and BNST were involved in the response observed during the 20-s CS .

25929688|Cannabinoid functions in the amygdala contribute to conditioned fear memory in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice : Interaction with glutamatergic functions . .

25929688|These results suggest that cannabinoid functions in the amygdala are increased in diabetic mice and that enhanced glutamatergic function in the amygdala of diabetic mice activates the endocannabinoid system , which enhances fear memory via cannabinoid CB1 receptors .

25928357|Pre-Training Reversible Inactivation of the Basal Amygdala -LRB- BA -RRB- Disrupts Contextual , but Not Auditory , Fear Conditioning , in Rats . .

25928357|The basolateral amygdala complex -LRB- BLA -RRB- , including the lateral -LRB- LA -RRB- , basal -LRB- BA -RRB- and accessory basal -LRB- AB -RRB- nuclei , is involved in acquisition of contextual and auditory fear conditioning .

25925480|Here we show that BLA neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens -LRB- NAc projectors -RRB- or the centromedial amygdala -LRB- CeM projectors -RRB- undergo opposing synaptic changes following fear or reward conditioning .

25915472|The Membrane Proximal Region of AMPA Receptors in Lateral Amygdala is Essential for Fear Memory Formation . .

25915472|To assess the possible roles of AMPAR-MPR in rat lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- in short - and long-term fear memory formation , we used glutamate receptors -LRB- GluAs -RRB- - MPR competitive peptides MPR -LRB- DD -RRB- and MPR -LRB- AA -RRB- .

25908496|These data have provided an understanding of the contributions of distinct brain regions such as the amygdala , prefrontal cortex , hippocampus , and periaqueductal gray matter to the control of conditioned fear behavior .

25891402|Based on these findings , we suggest that the amygdalar signaling of fear influences the stability of hippocampal place cells as a function of threat distance in rats foraging for food .

25888455|GABA and NMDA receptors in CRF neurons have opposing effects in fear acquisition and anxiety in central amygdala vs. bed nucleus of the stria terminalis . .

25888455|Here , we briefly review the role of CRF in anxiety , fear learning and extinction , focusing on recent cell-type and neurotransmitter-specific studies in the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- that may help to synthesize the available data on the role of CRF in fear and anxiety-related behaviors .

25888401|The external part of the pontine lateral parabrachial nucleus -LRB- elPB -RRB- is well situated for providing US nociceptive information to the central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , which was recently revealed to play a primary role in fear acquisition .

25883049|The central -LRB- CeA -RRB- and medial -LRB- MeA -RRB- nuclei of the amygdala constitute an output for the expression of fear reactions through projections to limbic and brainstem regions .

25883049|In the present study , we examined the role of NK1 receptors in these amygdala nuclei in the expression of defensive responses induced by electrical stimulation of the dPAG in rats and fear memory of this aversive stimulation .

25878138|The MATN also conveys auditory information to the amygdala necessary for avoidance and fear conditioning .

25878137|Oxytocin signaling in basolateral and central amygdala nuclei differentially regulates the acquisition , expression , and extinction of context-conditioned fear in rats . .

25878137|The present study investigated how oxytocin -LRB- OT -RRB- signaling in the central -LRB- CeA -RRB- and basolateral -LRB- BLA -RRB- amygdala affects acquisition , expression , and extinction of context-conditioned fear -LRB- freezing -RRB- in rats .

25878137|Taken together , these findings show that the involvement of the CeA and BLA in expression and extinction of context-conditioned fear is dissociable , and imply a critical role for oxytocin signaling in amygdala-based regulation of aversive learning .

25870551|fMRI analyses revealed that high trait anxious participants also showed greater representational similarity , as indexed by greater adaptation of the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- signal , between 50/50 surprise/fear expression blends and faces from the fear end of the surprise-fear continuum in both the right amygdala and right fusiform face area -LRB- FFA -RRB- .

25870551|These findings suggest that anxiety-related biases in the processing of expressions intermediate between surprise and fear may be linked to differential representation of these stimuli in the amygdala and FFA .

25859631|Synaptic competition in the lateral amygdala and the stimulus specificity of conditioned fear : a biophysical modeling study . .

25859631|Competitive synaptic interactions between principal neurons -LRB- PNs -RRB- with differing intrinsic excitability were recently shown to determine which dorsal lateral amygdala -LRB- LAd -RRB- neurons are recruited into a fear memory trace .

25852499|They have particularly shed light on two kinds of neurons in the basal nucleus of the amygdala , the so-called fear neurons and extinction neurons .

25851307|Two core components of the central extended amygdala , the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- Ce -RRB- and the lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BST -RRB- are highly similar regions that serve complimentary roles by integrating fear - and anxiety-relevant information .

25849981|ELS produced a decrease in GR mRNA in the brain , with a notable reduction in the amygdala that was associated with sustained alterations in anxiety , fear and sociability-like behaviors .

25846623|A limbic brain area , the amygdala plays a key role in emotional responses and affective states and disorders such as learned fear , anxiety , and depression .

25843406|Increasing evidence suggests that parallel plastic processes in the amygdala involve inhibitory elements to control fear and extinction memory .

25843406|GABAergic medial paracapsular intercalated cells -LRB- mpITCs -RRB- are thought to relay activity from basolateral nucleus -LRB- BLA -RRB- and prefrontal cortex to inhibit central amygdala output during suppression of fear .

25843406|Thus , mpITCs take part in fear learning-modulated feedforward and feedback inhibitory circuits to simultaneously control amygdala input and output nuclei .

25823790|Our results are in line with a stress-induced shift in fear learning , mediated by the MR , resulting in a dominance of cognitively less demanding amygdala-based learning , which might be particularly prominent in individuals with high MR sensitivity .

25819422|By replicating results observed using much smaller sample sizes , the results confirm that variation in amygdala reactivity covaries with individual differences in fear conditionability .

25819422|The link between behavior -LRB- SCR -RRB- and brain -LRB- amygdala reactivity -RRB- may be a putative endophenotype for the acquisition of fear memories .

25802982|Arc expression identifies the lateral amygdala fear memory trace . .

25802982|Using a fluorescence-based Arc reporter , we were able to visually identify the distinct subset of lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- neurons activated during auditory fear conditioning .

25792231|Contextual fear conditioning studies in animals and humans found an involvement of the hippocampus and amygdala during fear learning .

25791360|Previous neuroimaging evidence has shown an abnormal activation of the amygdala and prefrontal cortex in PTSD patients during fear conditioning and extinction .

25783771|A reduction of dopamine release or D2 receptor blockade in the terminal fields of the mesolimbic system , particularly the amygdala , clearly reduces conditioned fear .

25770355|Volumetric MRI showed that increased Lack of Fear was significantly associated with reduced amygdala volume , consistent with our hypothesis that the behavior seen in Sanfilippo syndrome is a variant of Klüver-Bucy syndrome .

25753409|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- are partners in fear learning and extinction .

25743759|The objective of this study was to investigate -LRB- 1 -RRB- the effects of SCH 23390 , a dopamine D1/D5 receptor antagonist , on contextual fear memory encoding , retrieval and reconsolidation , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- if the effects of SCH 23390 on conditioning involve the dorsal hippocampus -LRB- DH -RRB- and/or basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

25732249|Chronic stress enhanced fear memories are associated with increased amygdala zif268 mRNA expression and are resistant to reconsolidation . .

25732249|In rodents , chronic stress leads to amygdala hyperresponsivity and dendritic hypertrophy and produces a post traumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- - like phenotype that includes exaggerated fear learning following Pavlovian fear conditioning and resistance to extinction .

25716776|In auditory fear conditioning , the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- integrates a conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- from the auditory thalamus -LRB- MGN -RRB- and the auditory association cortex -LRB- Te3 -RRB- with an aversive unconditioned stimulus .

25716297|These studies established a predominant role for the amygdala in fear acquisition , while the ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- has been shown to be important in the extinction of conditioned fear .

25716297|The objective of the present study was to investigate if interindividual differences in morphology of the amygdala and the vmPFC are related to differences in fear acquisition and extinction learning in humans .

25716297|Stronger acquisition of fear as indexed by skin conductance responses was associated with larger right amygdala volume , while the degree of extinction learning was positively correlated with cortical thickness of the right vmPFC .

25684362|However , in risk allele carriers , higher anticipatory fear was paralleled by stronger amygdala activation during anticipation of severe vs. mild dyspnea .

25673841|Infusion of protein synthesis inhibitors -LRB- rapamycin or anisomycin -RRB- in the amygdala 10 min before memory retrieval transiently impaired auditory fear memory expression , suggesting ongoing protein synthesis is required to enable memory retrieval .

25669753|To address this question , we characterized retrieval-induced Fos expression in ventral hippocampal -LRB- VH -RRB- neurons projecting to the prelimbic cortex -LRB- PL -RRB- and basal amygdala -LRB- BA -RRB- after the extinction of conditioned fear in rats .

25638277|In this review , we argue that both behavioral and neurophysiological evidence supports a role of REM sleep for amygdala-related memory processing : the amygdala-hippocampus-medial prefrontal cortex network involved in emotional processing , fear memory and valence consolidation shows strongest activity during REM sleep , in contrast to the hippocampus-medial prefrontal cortex only network which is more active during non-REM sleep .

25618592|The demonstration that carbon dioxide provokes panic in fear-unresponsive amygdala-calcified Urbach-Wiethe patients emphasizes that panic is not fear nor does it require the activation of the amygdala .

25617327|Although intra-basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA ; 1.25 ug/side -RRB- and systemic PROP administration attenuated fear memory in DCS pre-treated ETOH rats , DCS/MDZ treatment did not affect memory in these animals .

25613546|Activation of the basolateral amygdala can modulate the strength of fear memories , including those in single-trial inhibitory avoidance -LRB- IA -RRB- tasks .

25600672|Hippocampal dendritic spines remodeling and fear memory are modulated by GABAergic signaling within the basolateral amygdala complex . .

25600672|GABAergic signaling in the basolateral amygdala complex -LRB- BLA -RRB- plays a crucial role on the modulation of the stress influence on fear memory .

25600269|The paraventricular thalamus controls a central amygdala fear circuit . .

25600269|Here we show in mice that the PVT regulates fear processing in the lateral division of the central amygdala -LRB- CeL -RRB- , a structure that orchestrates fear learning and expression .

25600268|Retrieval at late time points also activated PVT neurons projecting to the central nucleus of the amygdala , and silencing these projections at late , but not early , time points induced a persistent attenuation of fear .

25599382|We observed for the first time the existence of an altered fear processing pathway in ASD that is mediated by amygdala and prefrontal cortex hyperactivity , which might be at the core of the disorder .

25595987|The corticotropin-releasing factor -LRB- CRF -RRB- - producing neurons of the amygdala have been implicated in behavioral and physiological responses associated with fear , anxiety , stress , food intake and reward .

25595975|Chronic exposure to the stress hormone corticosterone -LRB- CORT -RRB- is known to alter plasticity within hippocampal and amygdalar circuits that mediate fear learning and memory .

25595975|The purpose of this experiment was to clarify the effects of chronic CORT on Pavlovian fear conditioning , which is dependent on intact hippocampal and amygdalar activity .

25593299|The amygdala , especially the basolateral nucleus -LRB- BLA -RRB- , has been critically implicated in Pavlovian fear learning but its role in punishment remains poorly understood .

25593295|The amygdala is critical for trace , delay , and contextual fear conditioning . .

25593295|Numerous investigations have definitively shown amygdalar involvement in delay and contextual fear conditioning .

25593295|However , much less is known about amygdala contributions to trace fear conditioning , and what little evidence exists is conflicting as noted in previous studies .

25593295|The present experiments further examine the contributions of amygdalar subnuclei to trace , delay , and contextual fear conditioning .

25593295|Pretraining lesions targeting the entire basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- resulted in a deficit in trace , delay , and contextual fear conditioning .

25593295|Immediate post-training infusions of the protein synthesis inhibitor , cycloheximide , targeting the basal nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BA -RRB- attenuated trace and contextual fear memory expression , but had no effect on delay fear conditioning .

25593295|However , infusions targeting the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- immediately following conditioning attenuated contextual fear memory expression , but had no effect on delay or trace fear conditioning .

25579850|The neural projections from the infralimbic region of the prefrontal cortex to the amygdala are important for the maintenance of conditioned fear extinction .

25579850|A retrospective analysis of behavior during fear conditioning and extinction revealed that despite no overall sex differences in freezing behavior , HF and LF phenotypes emerged in male rats during extinction and in female rats during fear conditioning , which does not involve infralimbic-basolateral amygdala neurons .

25560759|Acute tianeptine treatment selectively modulates neuronal activation in the central nucleus of the amygdala and attenuates fear extinction . .

25560201|This offered a unique opportunity to evaluate whether individual fluctuations in central serotonin levels , indexed by change in -LSB- -LRB- 11 -RRB- C -RSB- SB207145 binding , predicted changes in threat-related reactivity -LRB- ie , fear and angry vs neutral faces -RRB- within a corticolimbic circuit including the amygdala and medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex .

25557224|Abdominal pain-related fear learning and memory processes are altered in IBS , mediated by amygdala , cingulate cortex , prefrontal areas , and hippocampus .

25552573|Based on studies in rodents , the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is considered a key site for experience-dependent neural plasticity underlying the acquisition of conditioned fear responses .

25548107|? -LRB- 9 -RRB- - Tetrahydrocannabinol has been shown to modulate anxiety and facilitate the extinction of fear by inhibiting amygdala reactivity .

25545818|Here , we investigated fear extinction learning as a non-invasive probe for amygdala-dependent synaptic plasticity in patients with major depressive disorder and healthy controls .

25545818|The eye-blink startle response , a subcortical output signal that is modulated by local synaptic plasticity in the amygdala in fear acquisition and extinction learning , was recorded as the primary outcome parameter .

25545818|The finding of enhanced fear extinction learning in major depressive disorder is consistent with the concept that the disorder is characterized by enhanced synaptic plasticity in the amygdala and the ventral emotional network .

25542304|Current neurocircuitry models of anxiety disorders posit a lack of inhibitory tone in the amygdala during acquisition of Pavlovian fear responses and deficient encoding of extinction responses in amygdala-medial prefrontal cortex circuits .

25542304|However , one hypothesis holds that a pharmacologic strategy aimed at reducing amygdala activity while simultaneously augmenting medial prefrontal cortex function could facilitate the extinction of conditioned fear .

25542304|Key among the endogenous inhibitors of amygdala activity in response to social fear signals is the hypothalamic peptide oxytocin .

25530842|This extends upon previous work suggesting alterations in amygdala circuits underlying fear learning , emotion regulation , and the processing of interoceptive states .

25522410|We investigated whether neurogenesis occurred in the amygdala and its function in fear memory formation .

25522410|These results suggest that fear learning induces Shh signaling activation in the amygdala , which promotes neurogenesis and fear memory formation .

25522360|Extinction of conditioned fear is an associative learning process that involves communication among the hippocampus , medial prefrontal cortex , and amygdala .

25512576|Recent research has indicated that trace fear extinction requires a different neural circuit than delay extinction ; trace extinction requires the participation of the retrosplenial cortex , but not the amygdala , as noted in a previous study .

25508394|The role of GABAergic system of amygdala in vegetative and behavioral manifestations of conditioned fear was studied in groups of active and passive rabbits , selected upon testing in open field and light-dark chamber .

25498766|Results indicate that lower serotonin transporter availability in the amygdala , insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex predicts enhanced conditioned autonomic fear responses .

25490058|Thus , in the current study we investigated in the CA1 region of hippocampus and in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- the role of PACAP in the consolidation and extinction of contextual fear conditioning -LRB- CFC -RRB- and the interaction between PACAP and NMDA receptors .

25482326|Midazolam treatment before re-exposure to contextual fear reduces freezing behavior and amygdala activity differentially in high - and low-anxiety rats . .

25482326|These studies have demonstrated that LR rats are more sensitive to re-exposure to fear stimuli and that midazolam pretreatment was associated with modified brain activity in the amygdala and in the prefrontal cortex in this group of animals .

25475347|Despite the well-documented role of the amygdala in predator odor-induced fear , evidence for the relative contribution of the specific nuclei that comprise this structurally heterogeneous structure is conflicting .

25475347|These findings highlight the critical involvement of the MeA in processing olfactory cues signaling predator threat and converge with previous studies to indicate that amygdala regulation of predator odor-induced fear is restricted to a particular set of subnuclei that primarily include the MeA , particularly the ventral divisions .

25470336|Mice bearing a null mutation of the GAD65 gene develop hyperexcitability of the amygdala and hippocampus , and a phenotype of increased anxiety and pathological fear memory reminiscent of posttraumatic stress disorder .

25464763|The role of GABAergic system of amygdala in vegetative and behavioral manifestations of conditioned fear was studied in groups of active and passive rabbits , selected upon testing in open field and light-dark chamber .

25460498|Previous studies suggest that both the amygdala and the hippocampus are crucial for contextual fear conditioning .

25454591|Previous studies demonstrated that memory allocation is not random in the amygdala ; these studies showed that amygdala neurons with higher levels of the cyclic-AMP-response-element-binding protein -LRB- CREB -RRB- are more likely to be recruited into encoding and storing fear memory .

25451196|Maintenance of GABAergic activity by neuregulin 1-ErbB4 in amygdala for fear memory . .

25451196|Inhibitory neurotransmission in amygdala is important for fear learning and memory .

25451196|Neutralizing endogenous NRG1 , inhibition , or genetic ablation of ErbB4 , which was expressed in a majority of palvalbumin -LRB- PV -RRB- + neurons in amygdala , reduced GABAergic transmission and inhibited tone-cued fear conditioning .

25451196|Notably , expression of ErbB4 in amygdala was sufficient to diminish synaptic dysfunction and fear conditioning deficits in PV-ErbB4 - / - mice .

25451196|These observations indicated that NRG1 signaling maintains high GABAergic activity in amygdala and , thus , regulates fear memory .

25447473|To test whether BK channels are also involved in fear conditioning , we studied neuronal properties of amygdala principal cells in fear conditioned mice .

25447473|After behavior , we made brain slices containing the amygdala , the structure critically relevant to fear memory .

25447473|The resting membrane potential in lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- neurons obtained from fear conditioned mice -LRB- FC group -RRB- was more depolarized than in neurons from naïve controls .

25447473|The present findings suggest that emotional disorder manifested in the forms of fear conditioning is accompanied with BK channel suppression in the amygdala , the brain structure critical to this emotional disorder .

25446753|A bidirectional fibrous connection between CA3 and the amygdala reflects the importance of CA3 in fear conditioning .

25436666|We identified distinct neuronal populations in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- of rats that signaled generalized versus cue-specific associations and determined how their distributions switched during fear generalization .

25436666|These results provide a cellular basis in the amygdala for the alteration of emotional states from normal to pathological fear .

25430781|We show that a diet enriched with 1.5 % curcumin prevents the training-related elevation in the expression of the immediate early genes -LRB- IEGs -RRB- Arc/Arg3 .1 and Egr-1 in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- and impairs the ` consolidation ' of an auditory Pavlovian fear memory ; short-term memory -LRB- STM -RRB- is intact , whereas long-term memory -LRB- LTM -RRB- is significantly impaired .

25430779|The increased fear by high-GSK replicates animal findings and suggests a lift of the inhibitory effect of the BNST on the amygdala by the CRF1 antagonist .

25414039|Furthermore , this study suggests that the assessment of amygdala-related connectivity during fear processing may provide a prognostic tool to assess stress levels in heroin-dependent patients and to quantify the efficacy of maintenance treatments in drug addiction .

25413091|Classical work focused on the amygdala as a central structure for fear conditioning .

25322798|Optogenetic activation of presynaptic inputs in lateral amygdala forms associative fear memory . .

25322798|In Pavlovian fear conditioning , the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- has been highlighted as a key brain site for association between sensory cues and aversive stimuli .

25312830|Considerable research indicates that long-term synaptic plasticity in the amygdala underlies the acquisition of emotional memories , including those learned during Pavlovian fear conditioning .

25309337|In mammals , the central extended amygdala shows a highly complex organization , and is essential for animal survival due to its implication in fear responses .

25307137|We made the following conclusions : First , the amygdala is involved in detecting the saliency of items , in addition to fear , and supports goal-oriented behavior by modulating memory .

25295026|Mitochondrial Gene Expression Profiles and Metabolic Pathways in the Amygdala Associated with Exaggerated Fear in an Animal Model of PTSD . .

25295026|During the development of the exaggerated fear associated with PTSD , 48 genes were found to be significantly upregulated and 37 were significantly downregulated in the amygdala complex based on stringent criteria -LRB- p < 0.01 -RRB- .

25281921|We investigated whether basal dopamine release occurs in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , where sensory-related inputs are received and lead to fear or anxiety responses , and whether D1 - and D2-like receptor antagonists affect breathing patterns and dopamine release in the BLA .

25279828|It was shown that the H2 S levels in the amygdala of rats were significantly elevated after cued fear conditioning .

25279828|Both intraamygdala and systemic administrations of H2 S markedly enhanced amygdala-dependent cued fear memory in rats .

25279828|Moreover , it was found that H2 S selectively increased the surface expression and currents of NMDA-type glutamate receptor subunit 2B -LRB- GluN2B -RRB- - containing NMDA receptors -LRB- NMDARs -RRB- in lateral amygdala of rats , whereas blockade of GluN2B-containing NMDARs in lateral amygdala eliminated the effects of H2 S to enhance amygdalar long-term potentiation and cued fear memory .

25278857|Vagus nerve stimulation enhances extinction of conditioned fear and modulates plasticity in the pathway from the ventromedial prefrontal cortex to the amygdala . .

25278857|Subjects with posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- show impaired extinction of conditioned fear , which is associated with decreased ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- control over amygdala activity .

25278852|CO2 inhalation has been hypothesized to activate neural systems similar to those underlying fear learning , especially those involving the amygdala .

25278838|The central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- has a role for mediating fear and anxiety responses .

25277455|Surprisingly , during contextual fear conditioning , we found evidence of nuclear recruitment of endogenous CRTC1 only in the basolateral amygdala , and not in the hippocampus .

25277455|Consistently , CRTC1 knockdown in the amygdala , but not in the hippocampus , significantly attenuated fear memory .

25274821|However , they also showed impaired fear renewal ; in the danger context , they had less skin conductance response to CS+E and lower activity in amygdala and ventral-medial prefrontal cortex compared with combat controls .

25268254|EphrinA4 mimetic peptide targeted to EphA binding site impairs the formation of long-term fear memory in lateral amygdala . .

25268254|Long-term fear memory formation is believed to involve alterations of synaptic efficacy mediated by changes in synaptic transmission and morphology in lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- .

25268254|Microinjection of pep-ephrinA4 into areas adjacent to the amygdala had no effect on fear memory .

25265277|Greater psychosis symptoms were correlated with greater prefrontal , anterior cingulate , amygdala , and fusiform face area activation during masked fear processing .

25265277|By contrast , greater mania symptoms were correlated with less amygdala activation during unmasked fear and happy processing .

25234335|Stress-induced serotonergic transmission in the central nucleus of the amygdala is associated with anxiety states and fear .

25234225|Research has suggested that differences in dopaminergic system activity in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex may be one of the biological factors that underlie individual differences in response to fear stimuli , which may also affect the rewarding effects of amphetamine .

25229717|The study found that 4 weeks of treatment with 7 , 8-DHF improved spatial and fear memory , and ameliorated morphological spine abnormalities including the number and elongation of spines in the hippocampus and amygdala .

25223844|On a neural level , inhibitory anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- - amygdala coupling during fear conditioning that had previously been shown to characterize treatment response in this sample was driven by responders with the L/L genotype .

25202244|The effectiveness of this procedure in reducing fear expression was assessed in terms of behavioral outcomes related to PTSD -LRB- e.g. , hyper-reactivity to a neutral tone , anxiety levels in a plus maze task , social avoidance , and learning deficits in a spatial water maze -RRB- and of amygdala activity by evaluating c-fos expression .

25202244|We observed that this treatment : -LRB- i -RRB- significantly mitigates the abnormal behavioral outcomes induced by trauma ; -LRB- ii -RRB- persistently attenuates fear expression without erasing contextual memory ; -LRB- iii -RRB- prevents fear reinstatement ; -LRB- iv -RRB- reduces amygdala activity ; and -LRB- v -RRB- requires an intact lOFC to be effective .

25193320|The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of IL-6 on amygdala-dependent fear learning .

25193320|The data showed that infusions of IL-6 , aimed at the amygdala , dose-dependently impaired the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear .

25193320|Taken together , our results demonstrate that the learning behavior of rats in the auditory fear conditioning could be modulated by IL-6 via the amygdala .

25193320|Furthermore , the JAK/STAT3 activation in the amygdala seemed to play a role in the IL-6 mediated behavioral alterations of rats in auditory fear learning .

25185877|Inhibition of the amygdala central nucleus by stimulation of cerebellar output in rats : a putative mechanism for extinction of the conditioned fear response . .

25176168|Separate studies have implicated the cholecystokinin -LRB- CCK -RRB- and endocannabinoid systems in fear ; however , there is a high degree of anatomical colocalization between the cannabinoid 1 receptor -LRB- Cnr1 -RRB- and CCK in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , a brain region critical for emotion regulation .

25172668|At the relevant dose range , acute caffeine likely exerts more widespread impacts beyond the hippocampus , including the amygdala and striatum that are anatomically connected to the hippocampus ; together , they support the acquisition and retention of fear memories to discrete stimuli as well as diffused contextual cues .

25162644|Xe inhibits glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- receptors involved in learning and memory and can affect synaptic plasticity in the amygdala and hippocampus , two brain areas known to play a role in fear conditioning models of post-traumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- .

25162525|We labelled with channelrhodopsin-2 -LRB- ChR2 -RRB- a population of cells in either the dorsal dentate gyrus -LRB- DG -RRB- of the hippocampus or the basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- that were specifically activated during contextual fear or reward conditioning .

25155256|These findings suggest that , in adolescents with GAD , abnormalities in cortical thickness are present in an ensemble of regions responsible for fear learning , fear extinction , reflective functioning -LRB- e.g. , mentalization -RRB- , and regulation of the amygdala .

25152720|We have previously demonstrated that fear conditioning-induced synaptic potentiation in the lateral amygdala is reversed by group 1 mGluR-mediated depotentiation .

25152720|The synaptic expression of CP-AMPARs was negligible before , increased significantly 12 h after , and returned to baseline 48 h after fear conditioning , as evidenced by the changes in the sensitivity of lateral amygdala synaptic responses to NASPM .

25152720|Our findings , together with previous results , suggest that the removal of CP-AMPARs is not required for the depotentiation of fear conditioning-induced synaptic potentiation at lateral amygdala synapses .

25146309|Here , we examined the effects of long-term kindling -LRB- i.e. , 99 stimulations -RRB- of limbic -LRB- basolateral amygdala , dorsal hippocampus -RRB- and non-limbic -LRB- caudate nucleus -RRB- brain sites on conditioned fear and hippocampal plasticity .

25144877|Theta oscillations synchronize the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- with the hippocampus -LRB- HPC -RRB- and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- during fear expression .

25142952|Path models indicated that maladaptive social information-processing at ages 10 and 11 predicted increased left amygdala reactivity to fear faces , an ambiguous threat , at age 20 while accounting for childhood antisocial behavior , empathy , IQ , and socioeconomic status .

25142952|Exploratory analyses indicated that aggressive response generation - the tendency to respond to threat with reactive aggression - predicted left amygdala reactivity to fear faces and was concurrently associated with empathy , antisocial behavior , and hostile attributional bias , whereas hostile attributional bias correlated with IQ .

25142402|Furthermore , we show that loss of fear in the infected animals can be rescued by the systemic hypermethylation and recapitulated by directed hypomethylation in the medial amygdala .

25140050|Strong evidence links the 5-HTTLPR genotype to the modulation of amygdala reactivity during fear conditioning , which is considered to convey the increased vulnerability for anxiety disorders in s-allele carriers .

25140050|The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 5-HTTLPR genotype on amygdala reactivity and effective connectivity during fear conditioning , as well as structural connectivity -LSB- as measured by diffusion tensor imaging -LRB- DTI -RRB- -RSB- .

25140050|S-allele carriers showed exaggerated amygdala reactivity and elevated amygdala-insula coupling during fear conditioning -LRB- CS + > CS - -RRB- compared with the l/l-allele group .

25134639|Sleepiness induced by sleep-debt enhanced amygdala activity for subliminal signals of fear . .

25134639|In fear contrasts , subjective sleepiness was significantly positively correlated with activity in the amygdala , ventromedial prefrontal cortex , hippocampus , and insular cortex , and was significantly negatively correlated with the secondary and tertiary visual areas and the fusiform face area .

25124509|We confirmed the hyperactivation of the fear circuit -LRB- amygdala , insula , anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortex -RRB- in SAD .

25123309|Using an array-based approach after auditory fear conditioning and microRNA -LRB- miRNA -RRB- sponge-mediated inhibition , we identified a role for miR-34a within the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- in fear memory consolidation .

25123309|mRNA and protein levels of Notch receptors and ligands are downregulated in a time - and learning-specific manner after fear conditioning in the amygdala .

25107924|Competing mechanisms of long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- and long-term depression -LRB- LTD -RRB- in principal neurons of the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- are thought to underlie the acquisition and consolidation of fear memories , and their subsequent extinction .

25103087|In both rodents and humans , BDNF has been implicated in hippocampus - and amygdala-dependent learning and memory and has more recently been linked to fear extinction processes .

25103087|During early extinction , 24h later , we again observed heightened responses in several regions ascribed to the fear network in met-carriers as opposed to val-carriers -LRB- insula , amygdala , hippocampus -RRB- , which likely reflects fear memory recall .

25102562|Previous research shows that in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- , neurons with increased CREB are selectively recruited to a fear memory trace .

25093598|Essential for detection of relevant external stimuli and for fear processing , the amygdala is under modulatory influence of dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- .

25090974|The latter includes applying graded exposure in vivo principles during exercise therapy , for targeting the brain circuitries orchestrated by the amygdala -LRB- the memory of fear centre in the brain -RRB- .

25080586|However , a recent study in humans with bilateral amygdala lesions revealed that CO2 can trigger fear and panic even in the absence of amygdalae , suggesting the importance of extra-amygdalar brain structures .

25078294|These different phases of classical fear conditioning involve coordinated interactions between the extended amygdala , hippocampus and prefrontal cortices .

25076183|An organization of visual and auditory fear conditioning in the lateral amygdala . .

25076183|In mammals , the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is an essential locus for Pavlovian fear learning and memory .

25071439|N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor -LRB- NMDAR -RRB- - dependent long-term depression -LRB- LTD -RRB- in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is a form of synaptic plasticity thought to be a cellular substrate for the extinction of fear memory .

25071168|Examination of pups ' neural activity using c-Fos early gene expression and -LRB- 14 -RRB- C 2-deoxyglucose autoradiography during mother-to-infant fear transmission revealed lateral and basal amygdala nuclei activity , with a causal role highlighted by pharmacological inactivation of pups ' amygdala preventing the fear transmission .

25069244|A fear-circuit model of PTSD posits that vmPFC fails to inhibit the amygdala , which has a crucial role in fear learning .

25069241|In the amygdala , it has been demonstrated that cannabinoid CB1 receptors are particularly enriched in GABAergic axon terminals and moderately expressed on glutamatergic fibers , and involved in the fear coping strategies .

25066484|Roles of testosterone and amygdaloid LTP induction in determining sex differences in fear memory magnitude . .

25066484|Systemic testosterone administrations and an intra-lateral nucleus of amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- testosterone infusion diminished the cued fear freezing in orchidectomized male mice , while pretreatment with flutamide -LRB- Flu -RRB- eradicated these effects .

25056616|It might therefore seem plausible to expect that amygdala-coded fear should also influence decisions when animals make choices about instrumental actions .

25056616|It is therefore of interest that we have found in rats living for extended periods in a semi-naturalistic ` closed economy ' , where they were given random shocks in regions that had to be entered to obtain food , choices about feeding behaviour were in fact influenced by amygdala-coded fear , in spite of the null effect of amygdalar lesions on fear of dangerous location per se .

25056616|We suggest that avoidance of highly motivated voluntary behaviour does depend in part on fear signals originating in the amygdala .

25048388|Stress has been shown to have marked and divergent effects on learning and memory which involves specific brain regions , such as spatial and declarative memory involving the hippocampus , memory of emotional arousing experiences and fear involving the amygdala , and executive functions and fear extinction involving the prefrontal cortex or the PFC. Response to stress involves a coordinated activation of a constellation of physiological systems including the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal -LRB- HPA -RRB- axis and other modulatory neurotransmitters and signaling systems .

25048028|Reappraisal decreased fear circuit activity -LRB- including the amygdala and thalamus -RRB- .

25047645|One region often damaged by a TBI is the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- ; hyperactivity within the BLA is associated with increased expression of anxiety and fear , yet the functional alterations that lead to BLA hyperexcitability after TBI have not been identified .

25037003|Stress-induced enhancement of fear conditioning activates the amygdalar cholecystokinin system in a rat model of post-traumatic stress disorder . .

25036025|The central nucleus of amygdala plays an important role mediating fear and anxiety responses .

25031220|Suppressing anxiety and fear memory relies on bidirectional projections between the medial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala .

25026154|The 3 T group showed significant activity differences between joy and fear localized in bilateral superficial amygdala , bilateral hippocampus and bilateral auditory cortex .

25009263|In this study , we genetically identified neurons activated during contextual fear learning and separately recorded synaptic efficacy from recruited and nonrecruited neurons in the mouse basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

24998397|Serum and amygdala microRNA signatures of posttraumatic stress : fear correlation and biomarker potential . .

24990922|During fear conditioning , amygdala responses evoked by footshock progressively decreased , whereas responses evoked by the auditory cue that predicted footshock concomitantly increased .

24976583|Egr-1 mRNA expression patterns in the prefrontal cortex , hippocampus , and amygdala during variants of contextual fear conditioning in adolescent rats . .

24976583|We report activation of the immediate-early gene Egr-1 in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- , hippocampus -LRB- CA1 -RRB- , and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- 30-min following the training phase in the context pre-exposure facilitation effect -LRB- CPFE -RRB- and standard context fear conditioning -LRB- 180 s context exposure ? shock -RRB- .

24976214|The centromedial amygdala -LRB- CeM -RRB- , a subdivision of the central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , is believed to be the main output station of the amygdala for fear expression .

24974462|The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of fluoxetine -LRB- FLX -RRB- on the expressions of BDNF and Bcl-2 in the hippocampus , the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex of conditioned fear -LRB- CF -RRB- model mice .

24966831|In agreement with reports in humans , fear recall broadened FC of anterior structures to the amygdala and to somatosensory areas , suggesting integration and processing of both limbic and sensory information .

24964815|SFC caused increased OXTR binding in the dorso-lateral septum -LRB- DLS -RRB- , central amygdala , dentate gyrus , and cornu ammunis 1 , which normalized after social fear extinction , suggesting that these areas form part of a brain network involved in the development and neural support of social fear .

24948801|Neuronal ensembles in amygdala , hippocampus , and prefrontal cortex track differential components of contextual fear . .

24948801|To clarify the roles of the dorsal hippocampus -LRB- DH -RRB- , basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- in contextual fear conditioning , activity within these regions was mapped using cellular compartment analysis of temporal activity using fluorescence in situ hybridization -LRB- catFISH -RRB- for Arc mRNA .

24948801|In direct contrast , neuronal ensembles in the BLA were only reactivated at test if animals had been fear conditioned , suggesting that the amygdala specifically tracks the emotional properties of a context .

24948801|Interestingly , Arc expression in the mPFC was consistent with both amygdala - and hippocampus-like patterns , supporting a role for the mPFC in both fear and contextual processing .

24948801|Collectively , these data provide crucial insight into the region-specific behavior of neuronal ensembles during contextual fear conditioning and demonstrate a dissociable role for the hippocampus and amygdala in processing the contextual and emotional properties of a fear memory .

24947040|These data suggest that change of MR and GR in the amygdala are involved in the mechanisms of fear in PTSD .

24946071|One region with particularly dense concentrations of CRF receptors is the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , a critical structure for both Pavlovian fear conditioning and fear extinction .

24946071|While CRF has the potential to modify amygdala-dependent learning , its effect on fear extinction has not yet been assessed .

24945924|It has been recognized that the amygdala is involved in emotional processes and also a critical site of neuronal plasticity for fear conditioning .

24939839|NMDA receptor - and ERK-dependent histone methylation changes in the lateral amygdala bidirectionally regulate fear memory formation . .

24939839|It is well established that fear memory formation requires de novo gene transcription in the amygdala .

24939839|We provide evidence that epigenetic mechanisms in the form of histone lysine methylation in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- are regulated by NMDA receptor -LRB- NMDAR -RRB- signaling and involved in gene transcription changes necessary for fear memory consolidation .

24936175|In addition , 5-HT1A heteroreceptors are abundantly expressed post-synaptically in the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- , amygdala , and hippocampus to mediate serotonin actions on fear , anxiety , stress , and cognition .

24929864|We propose that the prefrontal cortex facilitates fear memory through the integration of sensory and emotional signals and through the coordination of memory storage in an amygdala-based network .

24928686|Local infusion of citalopram into the basolateral amygdala decreased conditioned fear of rats through increasing extracellular serotonin levels . .

24928686|To investigate the anxiolytic effects of SSRIs , we measured both freezing behavior and extracellular serotonin and dopamine levels in the basolateral amygdala when rats were given conditioned fear stress under local reverse-dialysis of citalopram , an SSRI , into the basolateral amygdala .

24928686|Local administration of citalopram into the basolateral amygdala significantly decreased freezing behavior induced by conditioned fear stress , and serotonin levels were simultaneously found to be significantly higher .

24928686|Furthermore , repeated conditioned fear stress under local infusion of citalopram into the basolateral amygdala induced further increases in extracellular dopamine levels .

24928686|Further studies investigating the role of dopamine in the amygdala for conditioned fear stress will be necessary .

24908482|We review recent work on the role of intrinsic amygdala networks in the regulation of classically conditioned defensive behaviors , commonly known as conditioned fear .

24904363|There is growing evidence that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- inhibits the amygdala and therefore plays an important role in the extinction of delay fear conditioning .

24903827|Dissociable roles for hippocampal and amygdalar volume in human fear conditioning . .

24903827|Previous studies conducted in brain-lesioned patients have shown that while the acquisition of autonomic fear responses requires an intact amygdala , a spared hippocampus is necessary for the development of the CS-US contingency awareness .

24903827|Here we tested the hypothesis that amygdalar and hippocampal volumes play dissociable roles in determining autonomic responses and contingency awareness during fear conditioning .

24903827|Left amygdalar volume significantly predicted the magnitude of differential SCRs during fear acquisition , but had no impact on contingency learning .

24903827|Our findings bridge the gap between previous lesion and functional imaging studies , by showing that amygdalar and hippocampal volumes differentially modulate the acquisition of conditioned fear .

24898851|Simultaneously , fMRI results indicated higher activation in anxiety-sensitive participants than in controls during interoception in a network of cortical and subcortical brain regions -LRB- thalamus , amygdala , parahippocampus -RRB- that overlaps with known fear circuitry structures .

24896183|We began by conditioning an animal to associate a foot shock with optogenetic stimulation of auditory inputs targeting the amygdala , a brain region known to be essential for fear conditioning .

24882568|Analysis of the fear versus neutral contrast revealed a significant negative correlation between amygdala response and DRN binding potential -LRB- nondisplaceable -RRB- -LRB- r = -.87 , p < .001 -RRB- .

24882159|Mice exposed to early-neonatal CORT treatment on postnatal days -LRB- PD -RRB- 2-4 exhibited strongly enhanced excitability of neurons of the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- in early adolescence and displayed impaired extinction of contextually conditioned fear memory , a type of behavior in which the BLA plays an important role .

24877622|The medial amygdala-medullary PrRP-synthesizing neuron pathway mediates neuroendocrine responses to contextual conditioned fear in male rodents . .

24877622|Considerable evidence indicates that the central amygdala plays an essential role in expression of freezing behavior after contextual conditioned fear .

24877622|The medial amygdala -LRB- MeA -RRB- , which is activated after contextual conditioned fear , was lesioned bilaterally by infusion of N-methyl-d-aspartate after training of fear conditioning .

24861582|The amygdala is a key brain region with efferent and afferent neural connections that involve complex behaviors such as pain , reward , fear , and anxiety .

24861582|Our main findings include -LRB- 1 -RRB- enhanced functional connectivity from the amygdala to multiple cortical , subcortical , and cerebellar regions in patients compared with control subjects , with differences predominantly in the left amygdala in the pretreated condition -LRB- disease state -RRB- ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- dampened hyperconnectivity from the left amygdala to the motor cortex , parietal lobe , and cingulate cortex after intensive pain rehabilitation treatment within patients with nominal differences observed among healthy control subjects from time 1 to time 2 -LRB- treatment effects -RRB- ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- functional connectivity to several regions key to fear circuitry -LRB- prefrontal cortex , bilateral middle temporal lobe , bilateral cingulate , hippocampus -RRB- correlated with higher pain-related fear scores ; and -LRB- 4 -RRB- decreases in pain-related fear associated with decreased connectivity between the amygdala and the motor and somatosensory cortex , cingulate , and frontal areas .

24837571|Only a combination of fluoxetine with extinction enhanced GluN2A expression in the amygdala and hippocampus , emphasizing the role of this NMDA-receptor subunit in the successful erasure of fear memories .

24835117|We begin by summarizing the anatomical and functional connectivity of a medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- - amygdala circuit that subserves fear extinction , including new insights from optogenetics .

24834031|Inhibition of projections from the basolateral amygdala to the entorhinal cortex disrupts the acquisition of contextual fear . .

24834031|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- has been implicated as a key structure mediating contextual fear conditioning .

24830026|The microinjection of a NTSR1 antagonist into the amygdala increased the percentage of freezing in conditioned fear , whereas the microinjection of NTSR1 agonist decreased freezing .

24830026|These results suggest that NTSR1 in the amygdala may play a role in the effects of MS on conditioned fear stress in adult rats .

24830026|Taken together , MS may leave epigenetic marks in the NTSR1 gene in the amygdala , which may enhance conditioned fear in adulthood .

24824914|DNRAb + mice exhibit memory impairment or altered fear response , depending on whether the antibody penetrates the hippocampus or amygdala .

24824914|Memory impairment was present in DNRAb + animals with hippocampal BBB breach and altered fear conditioning in DNRAb + mice with amygdala BBB breach .

24823365|Rapid amygdala responses during trace fear conditioning without awareness . .

24823365|We used a novel application of magnetoencephalography -LRB- MEG -RRB- to non-invasively record neural activity from the amygdala , which is known to be important for fear learning .

24822042|The midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei -LRB- MIT -RRB- are well-placed to contribute to fear prediction error because they receive extensive projections from the midbrain periaqueductal gray-which has a key role in fear prediction error-and project extensively to prefrontal cortex and amygdala .

24819022|The fear circuit of the mouse forebrain : connections between the mediodorsal thalamus , frontal cortices and basolateral amygdala . .

24818563|Their hippocampal CA1 regions , amygdalae and entorhinal cortices were harvested before , or 30 min or 3 h after the fear conditioning stimulation .

24818080|Augmented amygdala involvement in patients during symptom provocation , present across OCD symptom dimensions , might constitute a correlate of fear expression in OCD linking it to other anxiety disorders .

24814341|Using a combination of in vivo single-unit recordings and optogenetic manipulations , we show that in the mouse basolateral amygdala , interneurons expressing parvalbumin -LRB- PV -RRB- and somatostatin -LRB- SOM -RRB- bidirectionally control the acquisition of fear conditioning -- a simple form of associative learning -- through two distinct disinhibitory mechanisms .

24801769|The CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 impairs reconsolidation of pavlovian fear memory in the rat basolateral amygdala . .

24801769|We have investigated the requirement for signaling at CB1 receptors in the reconsolidation of a previously consolidated auditory fear memory , by infusing the CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 , or the FAAH inhibitor URB597 , directly into the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- in conjunction with memory reactivation .

24796094|Studies of anorexia nervosa suggest 1 -RRB- relationship between amygdala activation and fear of weight gain , 2 -RRB- relationship between prefrontal cortex activity and cognitive flexibility .

24795437|Our results confirmed the importance of fear in emotional communication , as revealed by significant blood oxygen level-dependent signal increased in a cluster within the posterior amygdala and anterior hippocampus , as well as in the posterior insula across all three domains .

24760545|Consistent with previous studies , we identified a large network of amygdalar , hippocampal , and neocortical brain regions implicated in fear memory retrieval .

24758222|Chronic stress is generally known to exacerbate the development of numerous neuropsychiatric diseases such as fear and anxiety disorders , which is at least partially due to the disinhibition of amygdala subsequent to the prolonged stress exposure .

24727401|Indeed , it permitted to depict precisely the role of specific cell populations in various brain areas , including the amygdala nuclei , the auditory cortex , the anterior cingulate , the hypothalamus , the hippocampus and the bed nucleus of stria terminalis in specific aspects of fear and anxiety behaviors .

24723867|Thus , many optogenetic studies have focused on harnessing the powers of this technique to elucidate the functioning of the amygdala in relation to motivation , fear , and memory as well as to determine how the amygdala regulates activity in other structures .

24723854|Modulation of their activity is thus thought to affect amygdala output and the generation of fear and anxiety .

24719001|These are : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the deactivation of the default mode network that generates spontaneous thoughts , contributes to the maintenance of the autobiographical self and is associated with anxiety and depression ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the anterior cingulate cortex that underpins attention functions ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- the anterior insula associated with the perception of visceral sensation , the detection of heartbeat and respiratory rate , and the affective response to pain ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- the posterior cingulate cortex which helps to understand the context from which a stimulus emerges ; -LRB- 5 -RRB- the temporoparietal junction which assumes a central role in empathy and compassion ; -LRB- 6 -RRB- the amygdala implicated in fear responses .

24709069|Accordingly , innate and learned fear responses to different threats -LRB- i.e. , predator , aggressive members of the same species , interoceptive threats and painful stimuli -RRB- are processed by independent circuits involving corticolimbic regions -LRB- the amygdala , the hippocampus and the prefrontal and insular cortices -RRB- and downstream hypothalamic and brainstem circuits .

24708929|The amygdala , together with the dorsal periaqueductal gray -LRB- dPAG -RRB- , medial hypothalamus , and deep layers of the superior and inferior colliculi , constitutes the encephalic aversion system , which has been considered the main neural substrate for the organization of fear and anxiety .

24703177|Mineralocorticoid receptors in the ventral tegmental area regulate dopamine efflux in the basolateral amygdala during the expression of conditioned fear . .

24703177|The present study sought to clarify the involvement of both types of corticosteroid receptors in two different brain regions -- the ventral tegmental area -LRB- VTA -RRB- and the basolateral amygdala complex -LRB- BLA -RRB- -- on the expression of conditioned fear .

24688461|The posterior aspect of the PVT -LRB- pPVT -RRB- is notable for its projection to the central nucleus of the amygdala which is essential for the expression of a conditioned fear response .

24688456|The amygdaloid complex is a key brain structure involved in the expression of behaviors and emotions such as learning , fear , and anxiety .

24686718|Therefore , other fear conditioning testing is needed to examine amygdala-dependent learning and memory effects , such as through the delay fear conditioning .

24671141|Mediation of the relationship between callous-unemotional traits and proactive aggression by amygdala response to fear among children with conduct problems . .

24663011|Glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 : a link between GABAergic synaptic plasticity in the lateral amygdala and conditioned fear generalization . .

24663011|These findings prompted us to hypothesize that a deficiency of GAD65 , the GAD isoform controlling the availability of GABA as a transmitter , affects synaptic transmission and plasticity in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- , and thereby interferes with fear responsiveness .

24662600|With serotonergic modulation , all these mechanisms should be recruited in lateral amygdala principal neurons and likely contribute to generation of region-specific neuronal activity patterns within the amygdala , which may at least partly implement its required role in fear and anxiety .

24661986|Evidence supporting this panic inhibition system comes from the following observations : -LRB- 1 -RRB- serotonergic neurons located in the ` ventrolateral dorsal raphe nucleus ' -LRB- DRVL -RRB- as well as the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray -LRB- VLPAG -RRB- inhibit dorsal periaqueductal gray-elicited panic-like responses ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- chronic , but not acute , antidepressant treatment potentiates serotonin 's panicolytic effect ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- contextual fear activates a central nucleus of the amygdala-DRVL/VLPAG circuit implicated in mediating freezing and inhibiting panic-like escape behaviors ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- DRVL/VLPAG serotonergic neurons are central chemoreceptors and modulate the behavioral and cardiorespiratory response to panicogenic agents such as sodium lactate and CO2 .

24657773|Interactions between the prelimbic cortex and the basolateral amygdala underlie fear memory processing , mostly through acquiring and consolidating the learning of a conditioned fear .

24657773|In the present study , the role of 5-HT neurotransmission of the prelimbic cortex , basolateral amygdala or the DPAG on the unconditioned and conditioned fear responses in rats previously selected as low - -LRB- LA -RRB- or high-anxious -LRB- HA -RRB- were assessed through local infusions of 5-HT itself -LRB- 10nmol/0 .2 ?l -RRB- or the selective 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2 - -LRB- di-n-propylamino -RRB- - tetralin -LRB- 8-OH-DPAT - 0.3 ?g / 0.2 ?l -RRB- .

24634648|Ex vivo dissection of optogenetically activated mPFC and hippocampal inputs to neurons in the basolateral amygdala : implications for fear and emotional memory . .

24634648|Many lines of evidence suggest that a reciprocally interconnected network comprising the amygdala , ventral hippocampus -LRB- vHC -RRB- , and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- participates in different aspects of the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear responses and fear behavior .

24634247|Studies have also shown that patients suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- exhibit deficient extinction recall along with dysfunctional activation of the fear extinction network , including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex , amygdala , and hippocampus .

24624089|We hypothesized that temporally integrated vocal and emotive responses , especially the expression of fear , vigilance and aggression , originate within the amygdala .

24624068|In the counterconditioning phase , prior fear association interacted with reward representation in the amygdala , where activation was decreased for rewarded compared to unrewarded CS - trials , while there was no reward-related difference in CS + trials .

24624054|Given similar impaired decision-making abilities and spared modulation of fear after both neonatal lesions of either OFC areas 11 and 13 or amygdala -LRB- Kazama et al. , 2012 ; Kazama and Bachevalier , 2013 -RRB- , the present results suggest that interactions between these two neural structures play a critical role in the development of behavioral adaptation ; an ability essential for the self-regulation of emotion and behavior that assures the maintenance of successful social relationships .

24619536|Our primary analysis was seed based , extracting connectivity between visual cortex and the amygdala -LRB- because of its role in fear and negative emotion -RRB- and visual cortex and the hippocampus -LRB- because of its role in memory -RRB- .

24618807|Chronic corticosterone exposure persistently elevates the expression of memory-related genes in the lateral amygdala and enhances the consolidation of a Pavlovian fear memory . .

24618807|Here , we examined the effects of a history of chronic exposure to the stress-associated adrenal steroid corticosterone -LRB- CORT -RRB- on the consolidation of a fear memory and the expression of memory-related immediate early genes -LRB- IEGs -RRB- in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- .

24610492|Deep brain stimulation of the amygdala alleviates fear conditioning-induced alterations in synaptic plasticity in the cortical-amygdala pathway and fear memory . .

24610492|The present study investigated the effects of DBS of the amygdala on synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity at cortical inputs to the amygdala , which is critical for the formation and storage of auditory fear memories , and fear memories .

24610492|In addition , all these auditory fear conditioning-induced changes could be reversed by DBS of the amygdala .

24610492|DBS of the amygdala also rescued auditory fear conditioning-induced enhancement of long-term retention of fear memory .

24610492|These findings suggested that DBS of the amygdala alleviating fear conditioning-induced alterations in synaptic plasticity in the cortical-amygdala pathway and fear memory may underlie the neuromodulatory role of DBS of the amygdala in activities of the amygdala .

24600362|The extinction of conditioned fear depends on an efficient interplay between the amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- .

24596089|XAP044 reduces freezing during acquisition of Pavlovian fear and reduces innate anxiety , which is consistent with the phenotypes of mGlu7-deficient mice , the results of mGlu7 siRNA knockdown studies , and the inhibition of amygdala LTP by XAP044 .

24582917|Brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the amygdala mediates susceptibility to fear conditioning . .

24582917|Susceptible mice had significantly more c-Fos protein expression in neurons of the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- following CSDS and showed exaggerated conditioned fear responses , while there were no significant differences between groups in innate anxiety - and depressive-like behaviors .

24573273|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is central to fear generation , and anxiety disorders are characterized by BLA hyperexcitability .

24571962|Specifically , the amygdala plays a pivotal role in conditioning and processing of fear , and exaggerated amygdala responses in SAD patients have been observed during various social-emotional stimuli .

24567865|Primarily known for its involvement in fear regulation , the amygdala also plays a critical role in appetitive flexible decision-making .

24560771|Recent research has found that individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- exhibit an impaired memory of fear extinction compounded by deficient functional activation of key nodes of the fear network including the amygdala , hippocampus , ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- dACC -RRB- .

24554785|When PAM -LRB- + / - -RRB- mice were fed a diet supplemented with Cu , the impairments in fear conditioning were reversed , and LTP was normalized in amygdala slice recordings .

24554670|Although the amygdala is important for emotional learning and other behaviors , including fear and anxiety , whether learning alters intrinsic excitability within the amygdala has received very little attention .

24554670|Previous work also demonstrated that learning-related changes in synaptic plasticity are also evident in less than one-third of amygdala neurons , suggesting that the neurons undergoing intrinsic plasticity may be critical for fear memory .

24554670|These data may be clinically relevant as enhanced LA excitability following fear learning could influence future amygdala-dependent behaviors .

24553733|To test whether the prefrontal cortex is capable of fear regulation in the young organism , we exposed juvenile rats to a threatening or nonthreatening stimulus and assessed fear and brain Fos activation of the mPFC subdivisions , amygdala and periaqueductal gray -LRB- PAG -RRB- .

24553575|Differential role of Rac in the basolateral amygdala and cornu ammonis 1 in the reconsolidation of auditory and contextual Pavlovian fear memory in rats . .

24553575|In the present study , we hypothesized that Rac in the amygdala is crucial for the reconsolidation of auditory and contextual Pavlovian fear memory .

24553575|A microinjection of NSC23766 into the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- but not central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- or cornu ammonis 1 -LRB- CA1 -RRB- immediately after memory retrieval disrupted the reconsolidation of auditory Pavlovian fear memory .

24551236|Fluoxetine pretreatment promotes neuronal survival and maturation after auditory fear conditioning in the rat amygdala . .

24551236|The amygdala is a critical brain region for auditory fear conditioning , which is a stressful condition for experimental rats .

24551236|Here , we investigated whether neurogenesis also occurs in the amygdala and contributes to auditory fear memory .

24551236|In rats showing persistent auditory fear memory following fear conditioning , we found that the survival of new-born cells and the number of new-born cells that differentiated into mature neurons labeled by BrdU and NeuN decreased in the amygdala , but the number of cells that developed into astrocytes labeled by BrdU and GFAP increased .

24551236|Chronic pretreatment with FLX partially rescued the reduction in neurogenesis in the amygdala and slightly suppressed the maintenance of the long-lasting auditory fear memory 30 days after the fear conditioning .

24551236|The present results suggest that adult neurogenesis in the amygdala is sensitive to antidepressant treatment and may weaken long-lasting auditory fear memory .

24548855|Injections of the somatostatin receptor type 2 agonist L-054 ,264 into the amygdala block expression but not acquisition of conditioned fear in rats . .

24548855|The amygdala is a crucial brain site for acquisition and expression of conditioned fear .

24548855|In the present study , the specific somatostatin receptor type 2 -LRB- SSTR2 -RRB- agonist L-054 ,264 was injected into the amygdala of rats either before fear acquisition or before the expression test on conditioned fear measured by fear-potentiated startle .

24548855|This suggests that amygdaloid SSTR2 plays an important role in the modulation of fear memory expression .

24529281|Animal studies have shown that carbon dioxide-mediated fear behavior depends on chemosensing of acidosis in the amygdala via the acid-sensing ion channel ASIC1a .

24525224|However , non-human animal data has shown that amygdala dependent threat -LRB- fear -RRB- learning can also lead to long lasting changes in cortical sensitivity , persisting even after extinction of fear responses .

24523680|The lateral/basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- forms an integral part of the neural circuitry controlling innate anxiety and learned fear .

24523535|The neuroplasticity induced by Pavlovian fear conditioning has likewise been shown to rely on interactions between BDNF and its principal receptor , tyrosine kinase receptor B -LRB- TrkB -RRB- , in the amygdala after training .

24523535|It is also unclear whether the noted increases in amygdala BDNF after fear conditioning are due to local gene transcription and translation or anterograde transmission from cortical regions .

24523533|Recent studies indicate that the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala -LRB- CeL -RRB- is essential for fear learning .

24523533|The CeL also controls fear expression by gating the activity of the medial subdivision of the central amygdala -LRB- CeM -RRB- , the canonical amygdala output to areas that mediate defensive responses .

24523532|We characterized both behaviorally and molecularly the transition from reconsolidation to extinction of conditioned fear and showed that an increase in calcineurin -LRB- CaN -RRB- in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- supports the shift from fear maintenance to fear inhibition .

24513634|For example , one neurobiological candidate mechanism for impaired extinction in adolescence involves changes in the functional connectivity within the fear extinction circuit , particularly between prefrontal cortical regions and the amygdala .

24508064|Chronic stress disrupts fear extinction and enhances amygdala and hippocampal Fos expression in an animal model of post-traumatic stress disorder . .

24503275|However , rTg4510 mice also display an abnormal hyperexploratory phenotype in the open-field assay , elevated plus maze , light-dark exploration , and cued fear conditioning , indicative of amygdala dysfunction .

24496082|Numerous studies have shown that the amygdala , hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex play important roles in Pavlovian fear conditioning .

24493848|Long-term expression of human contextual fear and extinction memories involves amygdala , hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex : a reinstatement study in two independent samples . .

24486965|To address this issue , we examined the effect of short - -LRB- i.e. , 30 stimulations -RRB- and long-term -LRB- i.e. , 99 stimulations -RRB- amygdala kindling in rats on trace and delay fear conditioning , which are aversive learning tasks that rely predominantly on the hippocampus and amygdala , respectively .

24486965|Overall , these results suggest that amygdala kindling promotes functional changes in brain regions involved in specific types of fear learning and memory .

24485496|The neurobiological correlates of PTSD involve enhanced salience processing -LRB- i.e. amygdala , dorsal anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- dACC -RRB- and anterior insula -LRB- AI -RRB- hyperactivity -RRB- , and reduced top-down inhibitory control over this fear response -LRB- i.e. dorsal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- hypoactivity and diminished structural and functional connectivity between the vmPFC , hippocampus and amygdala -RRB- .

24485496|Therefore , dampening the exaggerated fear response -LRB- i.e. by reducing amygdala hyperactivity -RRB- and enhancing top-down inhibitory control -LRB- i.e. by promoting prefrontal control over the amygdala -RRB- during psychotherapy is an important target for medication-enhanced psychotherapy -LRB- MEP -RRB- in PTSD patients .

24485496|Human fMRI studies indicate that intranasal OT attenuates amygdala -LRB- hyper -RRB- activity and enhances connectivity of the amygdala with the vmPFC and hippocampus , resulting in increased top-down control over the fear response .

24485472|However , few studies have investigated the effect of orexinergic signaling in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- which is responsible for contextual fear , and modulates the activity of the CeA .

24485458|The extended amygdala has dominated research on the neural circuitry of fear and anxiety , but the septohippocampal axis also plays an important role .

24484705|The amygdala is a temporal lobe structure required for the acquisition , consolidation , and expression of threat -LRB- fear -RRB- memories .

24478341|Using the M1R agonist cevimeline and antagonist telenzepine , as well as M1R knock-out mice , we show here that M1R , along with ?2-adrenergic -LRB- ?2AR -RRB- and D5-dopaminergic -LRB- D5R -RRB- receptors , regulates the consolidation of cued fear memory by redundantly activating phospholipase C -LRB- PLC -RRB- in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

24462103|The amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- are interconnected brain structures involved in the extinction of conditioned fear .

24462103|Here , we show that a defined subpopulation of basal amygdala -LRB- BA -RRB- projection neurons targeting the prelimbic -LRB- PL -RRB- subdivision of mPFC is active during states of high fear , whereas BA neurons targeting the infralimbic -LRB- IL -RRB- subdivision are recruited , and exhibit cell-type-specific plasticity , during fear extinction .

24393393|Successful CBT was reflected in an overall downregulation in these fear circuitry structures , especially in the right amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex , with reductions in amygdala responsiveness associated with self-reported symptom improvement .

24391566|Reactivating fear memory under propranolol resets pre-trauma levels of dendritic spines in basolateral amygdala but not dorsal hippocampus neurons . .

24391566|This intense fear response is associated with a massive increase in dendritic spines and phospho-Erk -LRB- p-ERK -RRB- signaling in basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- but neurons .

24391565|Specifically , neurons in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala with relatively higher levels of cAMP Responsive Element Binding Protein -LRB- CREB -RRB- seem to be preferentially allocated to a fear memory trace , while neurons with relatively decreased CREB function seem to be excluded from a fear memory trace .

24379767|Ensemble coding of context-dependent fear memory in the amygdala . .

24379157|This fear advantage is commonly believed to engage a specialized subcortical pathway to the amygdala that bypasses visual cortex and processes predominantly low-spatial-frequency information but is largely insensitive to high spatial frequencies .

24379157|These findings challenge the traditional notion that a subcortical pathway to the amygdala is essential for the initial processing of fear signals and support the emerging view that the cerebral cortex is crucial for the processing of ecologically relevant signals .

24376690|Additionally , differences in c-Fos expression in subregions of the prefrontal cortex and amygdala between rat strains during retrieval and expression of conditioned fear were found .

24374132|Here we examine the effects of DCS injected into the hippocampus or amygdala on extinction of context-evoked freezing after contextual fear conditioning in C57BL/6 mice .

24373901|We focused on two brain areas , the amygdala -LRB- of importance for the mediation of fear and anxiety -RRB- and the dorsal raphe -LRB- i.e. the site of origin of major afferent serotonin pathways , including those that project to the amygdala -RRB- .

24368626|Contextual fear conditioning in maternal separated rats : the amygdala as a site for alterations . .

24368626|An early stress experience such as maternal separation may increase activity in the amygdala -LRB- as pointed by the increased activity of Na -LRB- + -RRB- , K -LRB- + -RRB- - ATPase -RRB- , affecting behaviors related to fear in adulthood , and this effect could be task-specific .

24367308|Western blot analysis revealed that Arc expression in the right amygdala was elevated significantly above that observed in the left amygdala 60 and 90 min following fear conditioning .

24367307|The amygdala has traditionally been associated with fear , mediating the impact of negative emotions on memory .

24344179|We found that infusion of a USP14 inhibitor into the amygdala impaired long-term memory for a fear conditioning task , suggesting that USP14 is a critical regulator of long-term memory formation in the amygdala .

24300892|Hyperactivity and reduced freezing during fear memory retrieval were accompanied by an increased induction of the immediate early gene cFos suggesting hyperactivation of the hippocampus , amygdala , and medial hypothalamus .

24298153|Stress enhances fear by forming new synapses with greater capacity for long-term potentiation in the amygdala . .

24298153|Here , we report that in rats subjected to chronic immobilization stress , long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- and NMDA receptor -LRB- NMDAR -RRB- - mediated synaptic responses are enhanced in principal neurons of the lateral amygdala , a brain area involved in fear memory formation .

24298153|Together , these synaptic changes would enable amygdalar neurons to undergo further experience-dependent modifications , leading to stronger fear memories .

24291571|We have previously shown that auditory Pavlovian fear conditioning is associated with an increase in DNA methyltransferase -LRB- DNMT -RRB- expression in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- and that intra-LA infusion or bath application of an inhibitor of DNMT activity impairs the consolidation of an auditory fear memory and long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- at thalamic and cortical inputs to the LA , in vitro .

24290204|It is unknown , however , how extinction learning-induced changes in mPFC activity are relayed to target structures in the amygdala , resulting in diminished fear responses .

24290204|Here , we show that fear extinction decreases the efficacy of excitatory synaptic transmission in projections from the mPFC to the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , whereas inhibitory responses are not altered .

24287604|Contrary to the anxiolytic actions of Oxtr in the amygdala , we recently showed that Oxtr in the lateral septum mediate the enhancement of fear conditioning by social defeat in mice .

24277819|Using a combination of behavioral pharmacology , slice physiology , and optogenetic techniques , we show that orexin acts upstream of the amygdala via the noradrenergic locus coeruleus to enable threat -LRB- fear -RRB- learning , specifically during the aversive event .

24275003|Prolonged maternal separation -LRB- MS -RRB- activates the neonate 's hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis causing elevated basal and stress-induced corticosterone levels that may initiate amygdala-dependent fear learning .

24269252|Trace and contextual fear conditioning require the amygdala and hippocampus .

24267644|The extinction of fear is believed to involve inhibitory processes in the amygdala .

24267644|In this issue of Neuron , Trouche et al. -LRB- 2013 -RRB- show that basal amygdala neurons activated by fear conditioning are silenced by local inhibitory interneurons after extinction .

24262816|Despite knowledge of amygdala involvement in fear and anxiety , its contribution to the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder -LRB- OCD -RRB- remains controversial .

24262816|Amygdala functional alterations in OCD appear to be specifically modulated by symptom dimensions whose origins may be more closely linked to putative amygdala-centric processes , such as abnormal fear processing .

24260145|The serotonin transporter -LRB- 5-HTTLPR -RRB- , the catechol-o-methyltransferase -LRB- COMT -RRB- val158met , and the tryptophan hydroxylase-2 -LRB- TPH2 -RRB- G-703T polymorphisms are implicated in the regulation of amygdala reactivity and fear extinction and therefore might be of relevance for CBT outcome .

24256726|This control over fear behaviour relies on the activation of specific prefrontal projections to the basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , a structure that encodes associative fear memories .

24254958|Next , we will review how fear is measured in animal models using classical Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigms , as well as brain regions such as the amygdala , which are involved in the fear response across species .

24241397|Prefrontal entrainment of amygdala activity signals safety in learned fear and innate anxiety . .

24241397|To answer this question , we recorded activity in the mPFC , basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and dorsal and ventral hippocampus in mice during exposure to learned -LRB- differential fear conditioning -RRB- and innate -LRB- open field -RRB- anxiety .

24241397|These data suggest that selective tuning of BLA firing to mPFC input provides a safety-signaling mechanism whereby the mPFC taps into the microcircuitry of the amygdala to diminish fear .

24231200|However , adult rats showed sensitized fear learning , aberrant basal circadian fluctuations of corticosterone , increased amygdalar glucocorticoid receptors , decreased time spent in the open arm of an elevated plus maze , and an odor aversion associated with early-life footshocks .

24219397|Those investigations that have already probed human amygdala involvement in the processing of surprised facial expressions either used static pictures displaying negative surprise -LRB- as contained in fear -RRB- or '' neutral '' surprise , and manipulated valence by contextually priming or subjectively associating static surprise with either negative or positive information .

24216268|The prelimbic cortex and amygdala regulate the extinction of conditioned fear and anxiety , respectively .

24216140|Then we propose that for fear conditioning , stimulus elements and basolateral amygdala projection neurons are isomorphic and that the activational state of these '' elements '' can be monitored by the expression of the mRNA for activity-regulated cytoskeletal protein -LRB- ARC -RRB- .

24216140|Finally we apply these ideas to analyze recent data examining ARC expression during contextual fear conditioning and find that there are indeed many similarities between stimulus elements and amygdala neurons .

24212670|We previously showed that neurons in the lateral amygdala expressing elevated levels of cAMP response-element binding protein are preferentially recruited into fear memory traces and are necessary for the expression of those memories .

24212670|Thus , our findings establish a direct link between the activation of specific ensemble of neurons in the lateral amygdala and the recall of fear memory and its subsequent modifications .

24210457|In patients with lTLE , fear ratings were comparable to those of healthy subjects and were correlated with relatively stronger activations in the right compared to the left amygdala .

24210457|Patients with rTLE showed significantly reduced fear ratings compared to healthy subjects , and we did not find associations with amygdala lateralization .

24210457|This underlines the hypothesis that the right amygdala is biologically predisposed to processing fear , and its function can not be fully compensated in the event of right-sided mesiotemporal damage .

24204927|When the conditioned stimulus evoked no fear during extinction recall , theta interactions were directional with prefrontal cortical spike firing leading hippocampal and amygdalar theta oscillations .

24194705|Indistinguishable pattern of amygdala and hippocampus rewiring following tone or contextual fear conditioning in C57BL/6 mice . .

24194579|Memory consolidation of fear conditioning : bi-stable amygdala connectivity with dorsal anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex . .

24194579|The amygdala-dorsal anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- dACC -RRB- and hippocampus-insula functional connectivity were enhanced , whereas the amygdala-medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- functional coupling was decreased during fear memory consolidation .

24194579|Furthermore , the amygdala-mPFC functional connectivity was negatively correlated with the subjective fear ratings .

24194579|These findings suggest the amygdala functional connectivity with dACC and mPFC may play an important role in memory consolidation of fear conditioning .

24194579|The change of amygdala-mPFC functional connectivity could predict the subjective fear .

24193372|After reinstatement , we find significantly enhanced amygdala and posterior hippocampus activation in the RBX group , areas implicated in fear memory expression , while the PLC group exhibited enhanced activation in areas associated with extinction memory expression -LRB- vmPFC , anterior hippocampus -RRB- .

24189655|Synaptic modulation via basolateral amygdala on the rat hippocampus-medial prefrontal cortex pathway in fear extinction . .

24183705|Using a c-fos-based transgenic mouse , we found that contextual fear extinction silenced basal amygdala -LRB- BA -RRB- excitatory neurons that had been previously activated during fear conditioning .

24182621|Activation of ERK2 in basolateral amygdala underlies the promoting influence of stress on fear memory and anxiety : influence of midazolam pretreatment . .

24182621|The amygdala complex plays a key role in stress-induced emotional processing and in the fear memory formation .

24182621|It is well known that ERK activation in the amygdala is a prerequisite for fear memory consolidation .

24182621|Therefore , given that the ERK1/2 cascade is activated following stress and that the role of this cascade is critical in the formation of fear memory , the present study investigated the potential involvement of p-ERK2 in amygdala subnuclei in the promoting influence of stress on fear memory formation and on anxiety-like behavior .

24182621|Pretreatment with intra-BLA infusion of U0126 -LRB- MEK inhibitor -RRB- , but not into the adjacent central nucleus of the amygdala , attenuated the stress-induced promoting influence on fear memory formation .

24174677|Top-down control of visual responses to fear by the amygdala . .

24174677|The model with the greatest evidence included connections modulated by dynamic and static fear from amygdala to dorsal and ventral temporal areas , respectively .

24167308|Neuropsychological evidence is not yet conclusive but suggests that women show heightened amygdala reactivity to threatening stimuli , may be better able to exert prefrontal cortical control over emotional behaviour and may consciously register fear more strongly via anterior cingulate activity .

24142122|Research on pathophysiology is still in its infancy , but some brain regions , such as the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex , have been implicated in fear and anxiety .

24148846|Decreased amygdala-left rostral PFC -LRB- rPFC -RRB- functional connectivity was observed in the MDD group compared with controls for the fear condition -LRB- p < 0.05 , corrected -RRB- .

24146643|In response to conditioned cues and contextual information , greater avoidance symptomatology was associated with greater activation in amygdala , hippocampus , vmPFC , dmPFC , and insula , during both fear acquisition and fear extinction .

24133419|In the first experiment , we characterized the acute effect of an emotion -LRB- fear -RRB- conditioned stimulus on temporal discrimination using a bisection procedure , and tested its dependency upon an intact central amygdala .

24131794|Lesion and inactivation studies indicate that the central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- participates in the expression of cued and contextual fear , whereas the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- is only involved in the latter .

24131794|The basis for this functional dissociation is unclear because CeA and BNST form similar connections with the amygdala and brainstem fear effectors .

24129097|Intra-basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- infusion of midazolam prior to stress prevented both the enhancement of fear retention and an increase in the density of total and mature dendritic spines in DH .

24126924|Our results show that stress-related increases in circulating ghrelin , a peptide hormone , are necessary and sufficient for stress-associated vulnerability to exacerbated fear learning and these actions of ghrelin occur in the amygdala .

24126924|Virus-mediated overexpression of GH in the amygdala was also sufficient to increase fear .

24126454|It is known that this trait modulates fear learning and the activation of brain regions involved in it such as the amygdala , hippocampus , and prefrontal cortex and their connectivity .

24120093|Increased 5-HTT expression impaired , but did not prevent , fear learning and significantly reduced amygdala hemodynamic responses to aversive cues .

24120093|Direct experimental manipulation of 5-HTT expression levels throughout the brain markedly altered fear learning , amygdala hemodynamic responses , and neuronal oscillations .

24100022|Convergent effects of mouse Pet-1 deletion and human PET-1 variation on amygdala fear and threat processing . .

24100022|This novel evidence for the role of Pet-1 in fear processing and dendritic organization of amygdala neurons and in human amygdala threat processing extends a growing literature demonstrating the influence of genetic variation in the serotonin system on emotional regulation via effects on structure and function of underlying corticolimbic circuitry .

24097376|The amygdala is known to play an important role in the response to facial expressions that convey fear .

24097376|However , it remains unclear whether the amygdala 's response to fear reflects its role in the interpretation of danger and threat , or whether it is to some extent activated by all facial expressions of emotion .

24096136|We hypothesize that TrkB-dependent internalization of GABAARs may partially underlie a transient period of amygdala hyperactivation during fear memory consolidation .

24091205|Persistence of amygdala gamma oscillations during extinction learning predicts spontaneous fear recovery . .

24091205|Interestingly , recent data indicates that the strength of gamma oscillations in the basolateral amygdala during auditory fear conditioning correlates with retrieval of conditioned fear responses .

24091205|In the present manuscript we evaluated the hypothesis that post-extinction spontaneous fear recovery might depend on the maintenance of gamma oscillations within the basolateral amygdala by using single unit and local field potential recordings in behaving mice .

24091205|Our results indicate that gamma oscillations in the basolateral amygdala were enhanced following fear conditioning , whereas during extinction learning gamma profiles were more heterogeneous despite similar extinction learning rates .

24091205|Remarkably , variations in the strength of gamma power within the basolateral amygdala between early and late stages of extinction linearly predicted the level of post-extinction spontaneous fear recovery .

24091205|These data suggest that maintenance of gamma oscillations in the basolateral amygdala during extinction learning is a strong predictive factor of long term spontaneous fear recovery .

24086360|It has been well known that long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- of synaptic transmission in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- constitutes an essential cellular mechanism contributing to encoding of conditioned fear .

24081009|However , if the re-exposure of the CS odor during sleep was preceded by bilateral microinjections of a protein synthesis inhibitor into the basolateral amygdala , the subsequent fear response was attenuated .

24064198|The amygdala is a critical hub in the neural fear network , receptive to change using emotion regulation strategies and a putative target for iCBT .

24056700|In human subjects who underwent olfactory contextual fear conditioning , re-exposure to the odorant context in slow-wave sleep promoted stimulus-specific fear extinction , with parallel reductions of hippocampal activity and reorganization of amygdala ensemble patterns .

24055593|Extinguishing trace fear engages the retrosplenial cortex rather than the amygdala . .

24055593|We first show that the amygdala is selectively involved in delay fear extinction ; blocking intra-amygdala glutamate receptors disrupted delay , but not trace extinction .

24049190|Neurobiological research on animals suggests that trauma during attachment is processed differently by the brain , with maternal presence dramatically attenuating the fear center of the brain -LRB- amygdala -RRB- .

24048855|TgNTRK3 mice showed increased fear memories accompanied by impaired extinction , congruent with an altered activation pattern of the amygdala-hippocampus-medial prefrontal cortex fear circuit .

24047387|During infancy , the amygdala-lesioned animals displayed more interest in conspecifics -LRB- indexed by increased affiliative signaling -RRB- and paradoxically demonstrated more submission or fear -LRB- Bauman , Lavenex , Mason , Capitanio , & Amaral , 2004a , this journal -RRB- .

24038132|Early work hypothesised a network of brain regions involved in fear processing -LRB- e.g. the amygdala -RRB- , but more recent work has also pointed to the involvement of other cortical areas and other brain circuitry -LRB- e.g. the insula and anterior cingulate cortex -RRB- .

24034713|The significant roles and functional interactions of the medial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala in the regulation of fear provide a unique experimental setting to examine the effects of oxytocin on extinction of fear .

24009767|Linear regression indicated that the left amygdala volume negatively correlated with the accuracy of recognizing fearful facial expressions and positively correlated with the probability of misrecognizing fear as surprise .

24009566|We found increases in the phosphorylation of proteasome ATPase subunit Rpt6 at Serine-120 and an enhancement in proteasome activity in the amygdala following fear conditioning .

24008353|Potentiation of GluN2C/D NMDA receptor subtypes in the amygdala facilitates the retention of fear and extinction learning in mice . .

24008353|In the amygdala , NMDA receptors are critical for the acquisition , retention , and extinction of classically conditioned fear responses .

24008353|To further define the contribution of GluN2C receptors to fear learning , we infused the GluN2C/GluN2D-selective potentiator CIQ bilaterally into the basolateral amygdala -LRB- 3 , 10 , or 30 ?g / side -RRB- following either fear conditioning or fear extinction training .

24008353|These results support a critical role for GluN2C receptors in the amygdala in the consolidation of learned fear responses and suggest that increased activity of GluN2C receptors may underlie the therapeutic actions of DCS .

24005288|Assignment of model amygdala neurons to the fear memory trace depends on competitive synaptic interactions . .

24005288|We used biophysical modeling to examine a fundamental , yet unresolved , question regarding how particular lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- neurons are assigned to fear memory traces .

24002084|Our previous experiments demonstrated that systemic depletion of serotonin -LRB- 5-hydroxytryptamine , 5-HT -RRB- , similar to levels reported in patients with emotional disorders , enhanced glutamateric activity in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- and potentiated fear behaviors .

23974710|GluA1 phosphorylation at serine 831 in the lateral amygdala is required for fear renewal . .

23965605|Stress and depression are associated with aberrant neuroplasticity in the amygdala : there is increased dendritic arborization and synaptogenesis , perhaps explaining the increased anxiety and fear that are often apparent in depressed patients .

23964215|Consistent with decreased fear expression , DBS of dorsal-VS increased Fos expression in prelimbic and infralimbic prefrontal cortices and in the lateral division of the central nucleus of amygdala , an area that inhibits amygdala output .

23959880|Hence , the present study investigated the functional relationship between the PAG and amygdala in two different settings , fear conditioning and naturalistic foraging , in rats .

23938333|After a 22 day non-ethanol period , animals were fear conditioned to a context -LRB- relatively hippocampal-dependent task -RRB- or tone -LRB- amygdala-dependent task -RRB- , followed by retention tests and extinction -LRB- mPFC-dependent -RRB- of this conditioning .

23929546|The basolateral and centromedial amygdala -LRB- CMA -RRB- complexes are functionally heterogeneous , with distinct roles in learning and expressing fear behaviors .

23922038|Chronic exposure to benzyl butyl phthalate -LRB- BBP -RRB- alters social interaction and fear conditioning in male adult rats : alterations in amygdalar MeCP2 , ERK1/2 and ER? . .

23914157|The amygdala is important for emotional memory , including learned fear .

23914157|A number of studies for amygdala neural circuits that underlie fear conditioning have elucidated specific cellular and molecular mechanisms of emotional memory .

23914157|As a result , the circuits in amygdala could be drawn more elaborately , and it led us to understand how fear or extinction memories are formed in the detailed circuit level , and various neuromodulators affect these circuit activities , inducing subtle behavioral changes .

23891993|Elevated Arc/Arg 3.1 protein expression in the basolateral amygdala following auditory trace-cued fear conditioning . .

23891993|However , the amygdala 's involvement in trace fear conditioning , a forebrain-dependent fear associative learning paradigm that has been suggested to tap into higher cognitive processes , has not been closely investigated .

23891993|Furthermore , to our knowledge , the specific amygdala nuclei involved with trace fear conditioning has not been examined .

23891993|The present study used Arc expression as an activity marker to determine the amygdala 's involvement in trace fear associative learning and to further explore involvement of specific amygdalar nuclei .

23891993|Furthermore , these findings parallel studies demonstrating hippocampal-BLA activation following contextual fear conditioning , suggesting that trace fear conditioning and contextual fear conditioning may involve similar amygdala nuclei .

23889165|We conclude that sensory input conducted via the chromatic pathways into retinotopic visual cortex has limited access to the bi-directional connectivity with brain networks mediating the acquisition and expression of fear , such as the amygdaloid complex .

23871880|Inferring fear from face expression is reported as impaired after amygdala lesions .

23871880|In a two-alternative forced choice task , they demonstrate increased ability to discriminate fearful and neutral prosody , the opposite of what would be expected under an hypothesis of a global role for the amygdala in fear recognition .

23864672|Previous work identified lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- calcium-permeable AMPA receptors -LRB- CP-AMPARs -RRB- as a key target for synaptic removal in long-term depression -LRB- LTD -RRB- and persistent fear attenuation .

23864645|Mechanisms contributing to the induction and storage of Pavlovian fear memories in the lateral amygdala . .

23864645|The relative contributions of plasticity in the amygdala vs. its afferent pathways to conditioned fear remain controversial .

23861215|A group comprising all three anxiety disorders showed greater activation within the left amygdala and reduced activation within the vmPFC compared to the HC group during the masked fear versus neutral condition .

23825863|In animal models , stress and depression are associated with excitatory changes in the amygdala ; this aberrant neuroplasticity may represent increased fear learning , explaining the anxiety , fear , and related symptoms that characterize clinical depression .

23823694|Accumulating evidence suggests that dysfunction of the amygdala is related to abnormal fear processing , anxiety , and social behaviors noted in autistic spectrum disorders -LRB- ASDs -RRB- .

23815783|However , rats with lesions to the basolateral amygdala increased their cocaine-seeking responses under punishment and were impaired in their acquisition of conditioned fear .

23811025|Mice selectively bred for High and Low fear behavior show differences in the number of pMAPK -LRB- p44/42 ERK -RRB- expressing neurons in lateral amygdala following Pavlovian fear conditioning . .

23811025|We investigated whether phosphorylated MAPK -LRB- p44/42 ERK/MAPK -RRB- , a protein kinase required in the amygdala for the acquisition and consolidation of Pavlovian fear memory , is differentially expressed following Pavlovian fear learning in the High and Low fear lines .

23811025|We found that following Pavlovian auditory fear conditioning , High and Low line mice differ in the number of pMAPK-expressing neurons in the dorsal sub nucleus of the lateral amygdala -LRB- LAd -RRB- .

23800343|Both regions are involved in the stress response , but the amygdala is also involved in mediating response to fear and anxiety .

23785152|Research has identified distinct neuronal circuits within the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- that differentially mediate fear expression versus inhibition ; however , molecular markers of these populations remain unknown .

23785142|By comparison , the rescue of the CB1 receptor on dorsal telencephalic glutamatergic neurons prolonged the time course of DSE in the amygdala , and impaired fear extinction in auditory fear conditioning .

23769997|These results are consistent with models that implicate the amygdala in the evaluation and representation of the intensity of fear , and imply that the functional contribution of the amygdala to deciphering threat in visual scenes likely extends beyond the search for emotionally salient features .

23769728|The central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- is a major output region of the amygdala involved in organizing the expression of fear .

23769728|This study examined single unit activity in the lateral septum -LRB- LS -RRB- and the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- in the open and closed arms of the elevated plus-maze , a highly validated animal model of fear and anxiety .

23765157|One view holds that control regions engage ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- , an area associated with fear extinction , that in turn modulates amygdala responses .

23764903|Previously , we have shown that elevating brain magnesium , by a novel magnesium compound -LRB- magnesium-L-threonate ; MgT -RRB- , enhances extinction of fear memory without enhancing amygdala-dependent fear memory .

23761759|Fear conditioning , in which a cue is conditioned to elicit a fear response , and extinction , in which a previously conditioned cue no longer elicits a fear response , depend on neural plasticity occurring within the amygdala .

23761759|Projection neurons in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- learn to respond to the cue during fear conditioning , and they mediate fear responding by transferring cue signals to the output stage of the amygdala .

23754384|Reduced fear is accompanied by decreased amygdala and enhanced ventromedial prefrontal cortex activation in both species .

23751519|Dopamine D2 receptors modulate the expression of contextual conditioned fear : role of the ventral tegmental area and the basolateral amygdala . .

23748930|GR protein is present in the human hypothalamus and hippocampus , but little is known-neither in healthy subjects nor in depressed patients-about GR expression in the amygdala , a brain structure involved in fear and anxiety .

23746615|Results were strongest for emotion recognition of happy , surprise and fear : relative to CG participants , AT+SCT participants showed a neural activity increase in bilateral amygdala , right putamen and right medial prefrontal cortex .

23740899|Using a mouse model of dysregulated fear , we found altered expression within the amygdala of the Oprl1 gene -LRB- opioid receptor-like 1 -RRB- , which encodes the amygdala nociceptin -LRB- NOP -RRB- / orphanin FQ receptor -LRB- NOP-R -RRB- .

23740899|Systemic and central amygdala infusion of SR-8993 , a new highly selective NOP-R agonist , impaired fear memory consolidation .

23740899|This SNP is also associated with physiological startle measures of fear discrimination and magnetic resonance imaging analysis of amygdala-insula functional connectivity .

23740899|Together , these data suggest that Oprl1 is associated with amygdala function , fear processing , and PTSD symptoms .

23740896|A selective opioid receptor agonist prevents fear memory consolidation in the amygdala in a mouse model of posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- Andero et al. -RRB- .

23733176|While a majority of studies have focussed on the specific role of the hippocampus and amygdala in contextual versus cued fear , very few studies examined the potential role of subcortical limbic areas .

23732338|Extraversion scores were marginally negatively correlated with activations in the right amygdala in response to music expressing fear .

23732229|By testing the behavioral effects of SSRI treatment on Pavlovian fear conditioning , a well characterized model of emotional learning , we have the opportunity to identify how SSRIs affect the functioning of specific brain regions , including the amygdala , bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- and hippocampus .

23732229|With these findings , we propose a model by which acute SSRI administration , by altering neural activity in the extended amygdala and hippocampus , enhances both acquisition and expression of cued fear conditioning , but impairs the expression of contextual fear conditioning .

23732229|Finally , we review the literature examining the effects of chronic SSRI treatment on fear conditioning in rodents and describe how downregulation of N-methyl-d-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- receptors in the amygdala and hippocampus may mediate the impairments in fear learning and memory that are reported .

23727882|Extinction of '' fear conditioning '' may be mediated by actions of the drugs at sites other than hippocampus such as the amygdala , which is known to mediate the perception of fear .

23721965|Some chemical cues may produce signs of anxiety and fear mediated by amygdala nuclei , but unknown is the role of two anterior olfactory epithelial organs , the septal and vomeronasal organs -LRB- SO-VNOs -RRB- .

23720741|We show here that contextual fear conditioning markedly increases MMP-9 transcription , followed by enhanced enzymatic levels in the three major brain structures implicated in fear learning , i.e. the amygdala , hippocampus , and prefrontal cortex .

23714419|Chronic stress facilitates fear conditioning , impairs extinction , and produces dendritic proliferation in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , a critical site of plasticity for extinction .

23714419|Unexpectedly , irrespective of stress , rats that underwent fear and extinction testing showed basolateral amygdala dendritic retraction and altered spine density relative to non-conditioned rats , particularly in the left hemisphere .

23712665|Psychopathic behavior has long been attributed to a fundamental deficit in fear that arises from impaired amygdala function .

23712665|This pattern of amygdala activation highlights the potential role of LPFC in mediating the failure of psychopathic individuals to process fear and other important information when it is peripheral to the primary focus of goal-directed attention .

23709642|Experimental studies of conditioned learning reveal activity changes in the amygdala and unimodal sensory cortex underlying fear acquisition to simple stimuli .

23709642|Hemodynamic activity in the amygdala and category-selective cortex was modulated by the reinforcement contingency , leading to widespread fear of different exemplars from the reinforced category .

23709642|Learning to fear animate objects was additionally characterized by enhanced functional coupling between the amygdala and fusiform gyrus .

23705819|Thus we show the effect of exposure to fear on visual perception is not a general emotional effect , but rather one that may that depend on amygdala activation , or one that may be specific to fear .

23700645|We here investigated in rats the role of CB1R in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- in different phases of fear learning , memory and extinction .

23700645|Our data indicate that fear memory consolidation and retrieval , as well as extinction are regulated differentially by amygdaloid and cortical CB1R .

23699055|Auditory fear conditioning increases the tone responses of lateral amygdala neurons , but the increase is transient , lasting only a few hundred milliseconds after tone onset .

23699055|It was recently reported that that the prelimbic -LRB- PL -RRB- prefrontal cortex transforms transient lateral amygdala input into a sustained PL output , which could drive fear responses via projections to the lateral division of basal amygdala -LRB- BL -RRB- .

23694905|The intercalated cell groups of the amygdala -LRB- ITCs -RRB- are clusters of GABAergic neurons which exert powerful modulatory control of amygdala output , and are thought to play key roles in the extinction of conditioned fear responses .

23694905|Inhibition of OCT3-mediated transport by corticosterone may represent a mechanism by which acute stress alters dopaminergic neurotransmission in the amygdala , leading to alterations in fear and anxiety-like behavior .

23693003|A risk variant for alcoholism in the NMDA receptor affects amygdala activity during fear conditioning in humans . .

23693003|People at high risk for alcoholism show deficits in aversive learning , as indicated by impaired electrodermal responses during fear conditioning , a basic form of associative learning that depends on the amygdala .

23693003|In the present study we report reduced amygdala activity during the acquisition of conditioned fear in healthy carriers of a risk variant for alcoholism -LRB- rs2072450 -RRB- in the NR2A subunit-containing N-methyl-d-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- - receptor .

23693003|These results indicate that rs2072450 might confer risk for alcohol dependence through deficient fear acquisition indexed by a diminished amygdala response during aversive learning , and provide a neural basis for a weak behavioral inhibition previously documented in individuals at high risk for alcohol dependence .

23690923|These findings suggest that although marijuana users have greater reward sensitivity and less harm avoidance than controls , that attenuated amygdala response , an area that underlies fear and avoidance , was present in marijuana users with greater marijuana withdrawal symptoms .

23685762|In this study , a protein synthesis inhibitor , anisomycin , was infused into the basolateral amygdala of mice 9.5 h after retrieval of contextual conditioned fear .

23685230|Changes on auditory physiology in response to the inactivation of amygdala nuclei in high anxiety rats expressing learned fear . .

23685230|This study aims to evaluate the influence of the inactivation of the central -LRB- CEA -RRB- and basolateral -LRB- BLA -RRB- nuclei of the amygdala , after local infusions of the full GABAA agonist muscimol -LRB- 1nmol/0 .2 ?l -RRB- , on the AEP elicited in the CIC of rats tested under a learned fear state .

23684870|The roles of superficial amygdala and auditory cortex in music-evoked fear and joy . .

23684870|Results show that BOLD signal intensity increased during joy , and decreased during fear -LRB- compared to the neutral condition -RRB- in bilateral auditory cortex -LRB- AC -RRB- and bilateral superficial amygdala -LRB- SF -RRB- .

23664812|Glutamate transmission and synaptic plasticity in the amygdala are essential for the learning and expression of conditioned fear .

23664812|Taken together , these data revealed very different roles for mGlu7 and mGlu8 in amygdala synaptic transmission , fear learning and its expression .

23636982|Previous research has consistently found greater amygdala responses to fearful than to neutral faces in adults , convergent with a focus in the animal literature on the amygdala 's role in fear processing .

23635870|Studies of Pavlovian fear conditioning and extinction in rodents and humans suggest that a neural circuit including the hippocampus , amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex is involved in the learning and memory processes that enable context-dependent behaviour .

23630279|Here we show that at lateral amygdala synapses , fear memory consolidation correlates with increased surface expression of calcium-impermeable AMPA receptors -LRB- CI-AMPARs -RRB- , which are known to be more stable at the synapse , whereas memory retrieval induces an abrupt exchange of CI-AMPARs to calcium-permeable AMPARs -LRB- CP-AMPARs -RRB- , which are known to be less stable at the synapse .

23626910|Strikingly , the odor approach and attenuated fear learning of older pups can be re-established by the presence of the mother , due to her ability to suppress her pups ' corticosterone release and amygdala activity .

23624153|Prefrontal cortex and amygdala are key regions in the neural circuitry underlying fear conditioning and extinction , which thus has emerged as a useful model of stress influences on the neural circuitry underlying regulation of emotional behavior .

23624153|Such structural differences and/or alterations can have important effects on fear conditioning and extinction , behaviors that are mediated by the basolateral amygdala and prefrontal cortex , respectively .

23612301|However , synaptic rules which may determine the extent of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation in the amygdala , a key structure implicated in fear learning , remain unknown .

23603916|A neuroimaging study revealed that participants ' subjective ratings of valence -LRB- i.e. , pleasure/displeasure -RRB- and of arousal evoked by various fear , happiness , and sadness experiences correlated with neural activity in specific brain regions -LRB- orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala , respectively -RRB- .

23593384|Taking advantage of genome-wide microarray assay , we performed detailed studies of stress-affected transcripts in the amygdala - an area which forms part of the innate fear circuit in mammals .

23589091|Likewise , midazolam intra-basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- infusion prior to stress attenuated the enhancement of fear memory thus suggesting the involvement of a stress-induced reduction of the GABAergic transmission in BLA in the stress-induced enhancing effect .

23587405|Cumulative evidence suggests that the amygdala plays a central role in the acquisition , storage and expression of fear memory .

23578839|To investigate the role of BDNF in the extinction of amygdala-dependent cued fear memories , we analyzed fear extinction learning in heterozygous BDNF knock-out mice , which possess a reduction of endogenous BDNF protein levels to ~ 50 % of wild-type animals .

23576070|Freezing behavior in response to 22-kHz USV is paralleled by increased neuronal activity in brain areas regulating fear and anxiety , such as the amygdala and periaqueductal gray , whereas social approach behavior elicited by 50-kHz USV is accompanied by reduced activity levels in the amygdala but enhanced activity in the nucleus accumbens , a brain area implicated in reward processing .

23570859|Dendritic structural plasticity in the basolateral amygdala after fear conditioning and its extinction in mice . .

23570859|This study uniquely aims to delineate these structural changes in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- after both fear conditioning and fear extinction .

23567813|Activation of gastrin-releasing peptide receptors at the infralimbic cortex elicits gastrin-releasing peptide release at the basolateral amygdala : implications for conditioned fear . .

23567813|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and infralimbic -LRB- IL -RRB- cortex share strong reciprocal interconnections and are key structures in conditioned fear circuitry .

23567110|Participation of NK1 receptors of the amygdala on the processing of different types of fear . .

23567110|Within the amygdala the basolateral nucleus -LRB- BLA -RRB- is thought to act as a filter for innate and learned aversive information to higher structures , whereas the central nucleus -LRB- CeA -RRB- is considered the main output for the expression of fear reactions through projections to limbic and brainstem regions .

23567110|Although neurokinin -LRB- NK -RRB- receptors are abundant in the amygdala , their role in the processing and expression of fear is yet unclear .

23567110|The data indicate that SP may be involved in mediating responses of the animal in only certain types of aversive behavior and suggests a differential participation of the NK1 receptors in the processing of distinct types of fear in the amygdala .

23562305|A parallel amygdalar circuitry supports fear cue cessation of feeding .

23551217|Effect of D-cycloserine in conjunction with fear extinction training on extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation in the medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala in rat . .

23551217|In a separate set of animals , we found that DCS facilitated fear extinction and increased pERK levels in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex , prelimbic prefrontal cortex intercalated cells and lateral nucleus of the central amygdala , compared with saline control .

23546547|Next , by examining the pattern of Fos expression , we have been able to outline a brain circuit comprising septal and amygdalar sites , as well as downstream hypothalamic paths , putatively involved in the expression of contextual fear to social threat .

23542466|The storage of long-term auditory fear memory requires long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- in the lateral amygdala and de novo protein synthesis .

23542466|Here we employed quantitative proteomics to examine the expression of hundreds of proteins in the lateral amygdala in response to auditory fear conditioning .

23515889|In addition , strong and discrete expression of their receptors in the extended amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis suggests a potential role in regulating stress responses , emotion , anxiety , and fear .

23515155|The extended amygdala , including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- , modulates fear and anxiety , but also projects to the ventral tegmental area -LRB- VTA -RRB- , a region implicated in reward and aversion , thus providing a candidate neural substrate for integrating diverse emotional states .

23510549|During IF , ADHD patients showed deficits in regions centrally involved in fear learning and expression in terms of diminished CS + - related dACC and increased CS -- related amygdala signals .

23501052|These findings suggest REM sleep-associated consolidation of fear memory in the human amygdala .

23490071|On the other hand , the DER males , but not females showed an increased activation , as assessed by c-Fos expression , of the amygdala following fear conditioning .

23487762|Here we report that synapses in projections to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala implicated in auditory fear conditioning , which are potentiated by learning , enter a labile state after memory reactivation , and must be restabilized through a postsynaptic mechanism implicating the mammalian target of rapamycin kinase-dependent signaling .

23479945|They also play a very important role in modulating fear and anxiety response , especially by regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and amygdala activity by its projections to the brain stem and hypothalamic structures .

23474020|?-estradiol exert an inhibitory influence on contextual fear conditioning -LRB- hippocampal-dependent -RRB- and on sensitized fear conditioning -LRB- amygdala-dependent -RRB- .

23468832|Within the brain , conditioned anticipatory activations are seen in core areas of the central fear network including the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex .

23460450|Hippocampal NMDA receptor blockade impairs CREB phosphorylation in amygdala after contextual fear conditioning . .

23460450|In contextual fear conditioning -LRB- CFC -RRB- , hippocampus is thought to process environmental stimuli into a configural representation of the context and send it to amygdala nuclei , which current evidences point to be the site of CS-US association and fear memory storage .

23460450|Our results support the current ideas that the role of hippocampus in contextual fear conditioning occurs by sending contextual information to amygdala to serve as conditioned stimulus .

23452928|Synaptic potentiation in the nociceptive amygdala following fear learning in mice . .

23452928|Pavlovian fear conditioning is a classical form of associative learning , which depends on associative synaptic plasticity in the amygdala .

23452928|Recent findings suggest that the central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- plays an active role in the acquisition of fear learning .

23452928|In addition to the well-established plasticity of the lateral amygdala , the multi-step nature of this association system contributes to the highly orchestrated tuning of fear learning .

23452685|In addition , disruptions were observed in amygdala-based networks involved in fear processing and the coding of interoceptive states .

23447586|In vivo single unit recordings were obtained in the basal amygdala of freely behaving rats undergoing simultaneous reward , fear , and safety conditioning .

23442196|The findings suggest that greater spider phobic fear is associated with smaller left amygdala .

23438699|Recent functional neuroimaging studies show that the amygdala has a central role in threat evaluation , in response to conditioned and unconditioned stimuli , in fear learning and fear extinction .

23438699|This network also includes the thalamic pulvinar , which is densely interconnected with the amygdala , directly or indirectly , and which is activated by emotional face recognition of scary fear .

23438699|Both top-down inhibition mechanisms and emotional face recognition are altered in anxiety disorders , particularly in specific and social phobia , resulting in reduced amygdalar activity inhibition after anxiety - or fear - inducing stimulus perception .

23436341|ATN rats also exhibited reduced c-Fos and phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein -LRB- pCREB -RRB- immunoreactivity in the hippocampal formation and the amygdala after completion of the contextual fear test .

23433741|Cannabinoids and traumatic stress modulation of contextual fear extinction and GR expression in the amygdala-hippocampal-prefrontal circuit . .

23422280|These behavioral effects are correlated with hyperactivation of medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala subregions associated with fear expression rather than fear extinction .

23420655|The amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex : partners in the fear circuit . .

23420655|In mammals , the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex are two structures that play a key role in the acquisition , consolidation and retrieval of fear memory , as well extinction of fear .

23418586|Restricted sleep over the 5-day period increased the activity of the left amygdala in response to the facial expression of fear , whereas a happy facial expression did not change the activity .

23389809|Comparative dynamics of MAPK/ERK signalling components and immediate early genes in the hippocampus and amygdala following contextual fear conditioning and retrieval . .

23389809|In the present study we used immunocytochemical detection of the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway , to track activated neuronal circuits in the hippocampus and amygdala recruited during the consolidation and reconsolidation of a contextual fear conditioning -LRB- CFC -RRB- memory .

23385661|We have recently reported that blockade of PI3K in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- before retrieval of fear memory was associated with long-term reduction in fear responses , suggesting a possible role of PI3K inhibition in fear erasure .

23382811|MR diffusion tensor imaging detects rapid microstructural changes in amygdala and hippocampus following fear conditioning in mice . .

23382811|Following fear conditioning -LRB- FC -RRB- , ex vivo evidence suggests that early dynamics of cellular and molecular plasticity in amygdala and hippocampal circuits mediate responses to fear .

23377128|Decades of research have highlighted the amygdala 's influential role in fear .

23377128|We found that inhalation of 35 % CO -LRB- 2 -RRB- evoked not only fear , but also panic attacks , in three rare patients with bilateral amygdala damage .

23377128|These results indicate that the amygdala is not required for fear and panic , and make an important distinction between fear triggered by external threats from the environment versus fear triggered internally by CO -LRB- 2 -RRB- .

23368426|Enkephalin knockdown in the central amygdala nucleus reduces unconditioned fear and anxiety . .

23368426|The endogenous opioid enkephalins -LRB- ENK -RRB- are highly expressed in the central nucleus of the amygdaloid complex -LRB- CeA -RRB- where several lines of evidence point to a potential role in the modulation of fear and anxiety .

23354330|Experience-dependent modification of a central amygdala fear circuit . .

23354330|The amygdala is essential for fear learning and expression .

23354330|The central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , once viewed as a passive relay between the amygdala complex and downstream fear effectors , has emerged as an active participant in fear conditioning .

23349824|Using this method we show activation of the amygdala and related fear circuitry in response to a fear-conditioned stimulus and demonstrate that the magnitude of fear circuitry activation is increased following early life stress , a rodent model of affective disorders .

23345246|To explore the potential for microRNA-mediated regulation of amygdala-dependent memory formation , we performed expression profiling of microRNAs in the lateral amygdala of rats 1 h after auditory fear conditioning .

23345246|Microarray analysis revealed that over half of all known microRNAs are endogenously expressed in the lateral amygdala , with 7 microRNAs upregulated and 32 downregulated by auditory fear training .

23335892|The results are consistent with neuroanatomic models of the role of the amygdala in fear conditioning , and the importance of the limbic circuitry in mediating anxiety symptoms .

23328899|p300/CBP histone acetyltransferase activity is required for newly acquired and reactivated fear memories in the lateral amygdala . .

23328899|We show that local infusions of c646 , a selective pharmacological inhibitor of p300/CBP activity , shortly following either fear conditioning or fear memory retrieval impair training and retrieval-related regulation of histone acetylation in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- .

23328899|Our findings collectively suggest that p300/CBP HAT activity is critical for the consolidation and reconsolidation of amygdala-dependent Pavlovian fear memories .

23325248|Here , using rats with fully consolidated pavlovian auditory fear memories , we demonstrate a double dissociation in the requirement for GluN2B-containing and GluN2A-containing NMDARs within the basolateral amygdala in the memory destabilization and restabilization processes , respectively .

23325248|These data demonstrate that glutamatergic signaling mechanisms within the basolateral amygdala differentially and dissociably mediate the retrieval , destabilization , and restabilization of previously consolidated fear memories .

23322210|Neurons activated during fear memory consolidation and reconsolidation are mapped to a common and new topography in the lateral amygdala . .

23322210|In a previous study we showed that consolidation of a new fear memory is allocated to a common topography of amygdala neurons .

23321806|These clinical findings have been extended to animal models wherein SSRIs also potentiate anxiety and fear learning , which depend on the amygdala .

23321806|Consistent with previous reports , fear conditioning induced Arc protein expression in the lateral and basal amygdala .

23321806|These findings highlight the need to look beyond the traditional focus on input nuclei of the amygdala and add to accumulating evidence implicating these microcircuits in gating fear and anxiety .

23321541|For the first time , we show that long-term treatment with the highest dose of EGb improves the fear memory and suggests that increased cAMP-responsive element-binding protein -LRB- CREB -RRB- -1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein -LRB- GFAP -RRB- mRNA and protein -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- in the dorsal hippocampus and amygdaloid complex and reduced growth and plasticity-associated protein 43 -LRB- GAP-43 -RRB- -LRB- P < 0.01 -RRB- in the hippocampus are involved in this process .

23321541|The fear memory/treatment-dependent changes observed in our study suggest that EGb might be effective for memory enhancement through its effect on the dorsal hippocampus and amygdaloid complex .

23299040|Since cocaine - and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide -LRB- CART -RRB- regulates anxiety and stress in amygdala , we hypothesized that the peptide may also process negative psychological experience like fear .

23294552|Recent work has explored a number of interesting topics including the dissociation of emotional experience from memory in patients with amnesia , the reliability of specific emotional deficits following focal brain damage -LRB- including fear and the amygdala -RRB- , and the investigation of compensatory neural mechanisms in lesion patients .

23279689|Patients with amygdala lesions were found to be impaired in recognizing the fear emotion both from face and from music .

23278978|Separate amygdala subregions signal surprise and predictiveness during associative fear learning in humans . .

25408902|A large body of literature in animals and human implicates the amygdala in fear .

25225017|The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex was activated in concert with the amygdala , both in PTSD and in phobic states , suggesting a role in fear expression , rather than emotional control .

25225017|Treatment effects across different modalities including pharmacological and psychological interventions as well as with placebo regimens support that reduction of neural activity in the amygdala may be a final common pathway for successful therapeutic interventions irrespective of method , thereby linking neurotransmission to plasticity in a pivotal node of the core fear network of the brain .

23260230|Like fear conditioning , the acquisition phase of extinction involves new learning that is mediated by the amygdala .

23246402|Using this system , we found a large network of neurons in the hippocampus , amygdala , and neocortex that were active during context fear conditioning and subsequent memory retrieval 2 days later .

23246402|Retrieving a recently formed context fear memory reactivates neurons in the hippocampus , amygdala , and cortex .

23245746|Mirroring fear in the absence of a functional amygdala . .

23242419|The E3 ligase APC/C-Cdh 1 is required for associative fear memory and long-term potentiation in the amygdala of adult mice . .

23242419|In addition , we found that the Cdh1 cKO mice had impaired associative fear memory and exhibited impaired long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- in amygdala slices .

23242419|Our findings are consistent with a role for the APC/C-Cdh 1 in fear memory and synaptic plasticity in the amygdala .

23231808|This impairment of fear memory was corroborated with decreased LTP by AZ in the amygdala .

23224805|The amygdala was identified as one of the key regions of the brain involved in the processing of fear , anxiety , and pain -LRB- induced by visual images -RRB- .

23221411|In the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , it has been suggested that the plasticity that underlies fear learning requires activation of heterodimeric receptors composed of GluN1/GluN2B subunits .

23198599|Benzodiazepines also inhibit the amygdala , thereby reducing fear or anxiety .

23184972|We compared the valence effects within the IT cortex in monkeys with excitotoxic amygdala lesions -LRB- n = 3 -RRB- with those in intact control animals -LRB- n = 3 -RRB- using contrast agent-based functional MRI at 3 T. Images of four distinct monkey facial expressions -- neutral , aggressive -LRB- open mouth threat -RRB- , fearful -LRB- fear grin -RRB- , and appeasing -LRB- lip smack -RRB- -- were presented to the subjects in a blocked design .

23179863|The structure of Pavlovian fear conditioning in the amygdala . .

23179863|In a previous study , we used this strategy to uncover a common topography of neurons in the dorsolateral amygdala -LRB- LAd -RRB- that expressed a learning-induced and plasticity-related kinase -LRB- p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase ; pMAPK -RRB- , following auditory Pavlovian fear conditioning .

23179863|These data suggest that functional patterning of neurons undergoing plasticity in the amygdala following Pavlovian fear conditioning is specific to memory formation itself .

23179863|Overall , these data provide evidence for a spatial organizing principle governing the functional allocation of fear memory in the amygdala .

23177964|Gating of fear in prelimbic cortex by hippocampal and amygdala inputs . .

23177964|We therefore evaluated the contribution of basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and ventral hippocampus -LRB- vHPC -RRB- inputs to fear signaling in the prelimbic -LRB- PL -RRB- cortex , a PFC region critical for the expression of conditioned fear .

23177964|These results suggest a prefrontal circuit whereby hippocampus gates amygdala-based fear .

23175837|Long-term neural correlates of reversible fear learning in the lateral amygdala . .

23173719|Hemodynamic responses in amygdala and hippocampus distinguish between aversive and neutral cues during Pavlovian fear conditioning in behaving rats . .

23173719|Lesion and electrophysiological studies in rodents have identified the amygdala and hippocampus -LRB- HPC -RRB- as key structures for Pavlovian fear conditioning , but human functional neuroimaging studies have not consistently found activation of these structures .

23173719|To help distinguish between these alternatives , we used tissue oxygen amperometry to record hemodynamic responses from the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , dorsal HPC -LRB- dHPC -RRB- and ventral HPC -LRB- vHPC -RRB- in freely-moving rats during the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear .

23173719|Thus , hemodynamic signals in the amygdala and HPC can detect the different patterns of neuronal activity evoked by threatening vs. neutral stimuli during fear conditioning .

23168129|Although the neurobiological mechanisms underlying panic disorder -LRB- PD -RRB- are not yet clearly understood , increasing amount of evidence from animal and human studies suggests that the amygdala , which plays a pivotal role in neural network of fear and anxiety , has an important role in the pathogenesis of PD .

23164732|A model of amygdala-hippocampal-prefrontal interaction in fear conditioning and extinction in animals . .

23164732|Empirical research has shown that the amygdala , hippocampus , and ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- are involved in fear conditioning .

23164732|In addition , we propose that hippocampal input to both vmPFC and basolateral amygdala is essential for contextual modulation of fear acquisition and extinction .

23154927|Whereas recent studies suggested that acute BDNF/TrkB signaling regulates amygdala-dependent fear learning , no impairments of cued fear learning were reported in heterozygous BDNF knock-out mice -LRB- BDNF -LRB- + / - -RRB- -RRB- .

23154927|However , the age-dependent decline in the efficiency of fear conditioning in BDNF -LRB- + / - -RRB- mice was not accompanied by reduced BDNF expression in the amygdala .

23149445|In vivo knockdown of GAD67 in the amygdala disrupts fear extinction and the anxiolytic-like effect of diazepam in mice . .

23149445|In mammals , ?-aminobutyric acid -LRB- GABA -RRB- transmission in the amygdala is particularly important for controlling levels of fear and anxiety .

23149445|In the current study , we sought to examine the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear in mice with knocked down expression of the GABA synthesizing enzyme GAD67 in the amygdala using a lentiviral-based -LRB- LV -RRB- RNA interference strategy to locally induce loss-of-function .

23149445|Together , these studies suggest that of GABAergic transmission in amygdala mediates the inhibition of conditioned fear and the anxiolytic-like effect of diazepam in adult mice .

23142759|Within the amygdala , optogenetics has allowed the study of intra-amygdala microcircuitry as well as interconnections with distal regions involved in fear and anxiety .

23139148|Across participants , there was enhanced anterior insula -LRB- aINS -RRB- coupling with the posterior insula , ACC , SMA , and amygdala during presentation of the CS , consistent with a modulatory role for the aINS in the execution of fear responses .

23134303|Stathmin is an inhibitor of microtubule formation , as highly expressed in the lateral nucleus -LRB- LA -RRB- of the amygdala as well as in the thalamic and cortical structures that send information to the LA about the learned and innate fear .

23118193|Moreover , we found an inverse correlation between plasma oxytocin and the volume of the right amygdala and the right hippocampus , 2 brain areas implicated in fear and anxiety .

22959113|Beyond its classical role in fear processing , the amygdala is considered as a region that detects salient and personally relevant stimuli in cooperation with ventral and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex .

23104989|Previous studies have shown that corticosterone , acting within the basolateral amygdala , enhances the fear response to environmental stimuli .

23104989|The concerted effects of parasitism on two pivotal physiological nodes of the fear response provide an animal model relevant to interactions between stress hormones and amygdalar plasticity .

23090707|Attention is directed toward the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- and the interaction it has with the amygdala as this circuit has crucial roles in both the acquisition and the extinction of fear associations .

23087627|The enhancement of the startle response by conditioned fear -LRB- '' fear-potentiated startle '' -RRB- involves the activation of the amygdala .

23087627|The LC may also be involved in both sensitization and fear potentiation : pain signals activate the LC both directly and indirectly via the amygdala , which results in enhanced motoneurone activity , leading to an enhanced muscular response .

23087626|Most fear-related associative paradigms have suggested that an aspect of the fear association is stored in the amygdala ; however , some fear-motivated associative paradigms suggest that the amygdala is not a site of storage , but rather facilitates consolidation in other brain regions .

23087626|The following review will discuss the amygdala 's involvement , either as a site of storage or facilitating storage in other brain regions such as the neocortex , in fear - and non-fear-motivated associative paradigms .

23087626|In this review , we will discuss recent findings suggesting a broader role for the amygdala in increasing the saliency of behaviorally relevant information , thus facilitating acquisition for all forms of memory , both fear - and non-fear-related .

23087085|The expression of the GABA receptor clustering protein gephyrin was significantly A elevated in the amygdala after cued fear extinction training and a subsequent extinction retention test given 24 h later .

23087085|Gephyrin expression in the hippocampus but not in the amygdala or the medial prefrontal cortex was significantly reduced after contextual fear extinction sessions given 1 or 5 days after training .

23077066|Dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- promotes fear learning by disinhibiting principal neurons -LRB- PNs -RRB- and enabling synaptic plasticity in their sensory inputs .

23073641|Correspondingly , acute inactivation of amygdala or of ventral striatum in rats respectively abolished only conditioned fear or only conditioned relief .

23069667|We have previously characterized the ex vivo depotentiation -LRB- depotentiation -LRB- ex vivo -RRB- -RRB- of conditioning-induced synaptic potentiation at thalamic input synapses onto the lateral amygdala -LRB- T-LA synapses -RRB- as a potential cellular substrate for fear extinction : both depotentiation -LRB- ex vivo -RRB- and fear extinction require NMDA receptors , mitogen-activated protein kinases , metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 , de novo protein synthesis and AMPA receptor internalization in the amygdala .

23055486|PACAP is highly expressed in the amygdala , a subcortical brain area involved in both innate and learned fear , suggesting a role for PACAP-mediated signaling in fear-related behaviors .

23051895|However , in sham-irradiated mice , ALA treatment impaired cortical-dependent novel object recognition and amygdala-dependent cued fear conditioning .

23049953|Consistent with data demonstrating the anxiogenic consequences of 5-HT -LRB- 2C -RRB- R activation in humans and rodents , we have previously reported that site-specific administration of the selective 5-HT -LRB- 2C -RRB- R agonist CP-809101 in the lateral/basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- increases shock-elicited fear while administration of CP-809101 in the dorsal striatum -LRB- DS -RRB- interferes with shuttle box escape learning .

23044043|mPFC output to subcortical brain areas such as the amygdala controls emotional processing and plays an important role in fear extinction .

23036960|Contrasting effects of pretraining , posttraining , and pretesting infusions of corticotropin-releasing factor into the lateral amygdala : attenuation of fear memory formation but facilitation of its expression . .

23036960|The lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is a crucial part of the neural circuitry underlying the formation and storage of memories established through fear conditioning .

23036373|Effects of serotonergic terminal lesion in the amygdala on conditioned fear and innate fear in rats . .

23036373|In our previous study , we indicated that local injections of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor into the amygdala attenuated anxiety-related behaviors in conditioned fear in rats .

23036373|In the present study , we investigated the effects of serotonergic terminal lesions in the amygdala and in mPFC induced by local injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine -LRB- 5,7-DHT -RRB- , on anxiety-related behaviors in conditioned fear and the elevated plus-maze test in rats .

23036373|A 5,7-DHT lesion in the amygdala attenuated memory-dependent fear assessed by conditioned fear , but enhanced memory-independent fear assessed by the elevated plus-maze test .

23036373|These results suggest that the role of the amygdalar serotonergic system in fear is different between memory-dependent and independent fear and , in particular , it is paradoxical that an amygdalar serotonergic lesion exerts a similar effect on memory-dependent fear to SSRI .

23036373|Moreover , a serotonergic lesion in the amygdala enhanced the retrieval of extinction memory in conditioned fear ; however , a serotonergic lesion in mPFC did not bring about any behavioral changes .

23032873|Regulation of neuronal plasticity and fear by a dynamic change in PAR1-G protein coupling in the amygdala . .

23032873|In the basolateral amygdala of fear-naive mice PAR1 couples to G?q / 11 and G?o proteins , while after fear conditioning coupling to G?o increases .

23032873|Our findings point to experience-specific shifts in PAR1-G protein coupling in the amygdala as a novel mechanism regulating neuronal excitability and fear .

23032389|In children with conduct problems , high levels of callous-unemotional traits are associated with amygdala hypoactivity to consciously perceived fear , while low levels of callous-unemotional traits may be associated with amygdala hyperactivity .

23032389|These data demonstrate differential amygdala activity to preattentively presented fear in children with conduct problems grouped by callous-unemotional traits , with high levels associated with lower amygdala reactivity .

23029199|Muscarinic receptors in amygdala control trace fear conditioning . .

23029199|The present study examined the role of amygdalar mAChRs in trace fear conditioning , a paradigm that requires transient memory .

23027931|Prefrontal cortical and hippocampal inputs to the amygdala have recently been shown to regulate the retrieval of fear memories , but the cellular organization of these projections remains unclear .

23027931|By using anterograde tracing in a transgenic rat in which neurons express a dendritically-targeted PSD-95 : Venus fusion protein under the control of a c-fos promoter , we found that , during the retrieval of extinction memory , the dominant input to active neurons in the lateral amygdala was from the infralimbic cortex , whereas the retrieval of fear memory was associated with greater hippocampal and prelimbic inputs .

23019518|GM-CSF ablation caused various hippocampus and amygdala-dependent deficits in spatial and fear memory while rendering intact basic parameters like motor function , inherent anxiety , and pain threshold levels .

23018123|Fos-like immunoreactivity associated with fear conditioning was seen in the amygdala and cingulate cortex area 1 -LRB- Cg1 -RRB- .

23015542|In contrast , harmane increased dopamine and noradrenaline content and reduced dopamine turnover in the amygdala of fear-conditioned rats only , suggesting differential effects on catecholaminergic transmission in the presence and absence of fear .

23015447|L-type voltage-gated calcium channels in the basolateral amygdala are necessary for fear extinction . .

23015447|L-type voltage-gated calcium channels -LRB- L-VGCCs -RRB- in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- are necessary for long-term memory of fear conditioning , where they are thought to drive the activation of protein kinases and to initiate gene transcription .

23012767|-LSB- Population coding of fear memory in the lateral amygdala -RSB- . .

23010137|Tissue analyses suggest the cued fear extinction deficit may be related to changes in the GABA -LRB- B2 -RRB- receptor subunit in the amygdala .

22999654|Thus , testosterone appears not to reduce fear by attenuating the amygdala response toward signals of threat .

22999654|Furthermore , literature on the distinct roles of the SFA and BLA in fear processing show that increased activation of these subregions of the amygdala is consistent with a fear reducing effect of testosterone .

22997340|Disruption of reconsolidation erases a fear memory trace in the human amygdala . .

22997340|Using functional brain imaging , we found that , after a conditioned fear memory was formed , reactivation and reconsolidation left a memory trace in the basolateral amygdala that predicted subsequent fear expression and was tightly coupled to activity in the fear circuit of the brain .

22997340|Thus , as previously demonstrated in rodents , fear memory suppression resulting from behavioral disruption of reconsolidation is amygdala-dependent also in humans , which supports an evolutionarily conserved memory-update mechanism .

22993433|Together , our findings highlight the role of predictive value in explaining amygdala responses and identify mechanisms that shape these responses in human fear conditioning .

22993170|Although evidence has established that the amygdala is a key brain site for memory storage and retrieval of auditory conditioned fear memory , it remains elusive whether the auditory brain regions may be involved in fear memory storage or retrieval .

22993170|To investigate this possibility , we systematically imaged the brain activity patterns in the lateral amygdala , MGm/PIN , and AuV/TeA using activity-dependent induction of immediate early gene zif268 after recent and remote memory retrieval of auditory conditioned fear .

22993170|Consistent with the critical role of the amygdala in fear memory , the zif268 activity in the lateral amygdala was significantly increased after both recent and remote memory retrieval .

22993170|Taken together , our results support that the lateral amygdala is a key brain site for permanent fear memory storage and suggest that MGm/PIN and AuV/TeA might play a role for remote memory storage or retrieval of auditory conditioned fear , or , alternatively , that these auditory brain regions might have a different way of processing for familiar or conditioned tone information at recent and remote time phases .

22986165|These results indicate a short distance and a rapid extrasynaptic form of dopamine volume transmission mediated via D -LRB- 1 -RRB- receptors in the AIC and PIC which may enhance fear and anxiety by suppressing feed-forward inhibition in the basolateral and central amygdaloid nuclei .

22984177|Perception of threatening faces activated circuitry including amygdalar , thalamic , and brainstem regions , known in humans and other vertebrates to be related to emotion , motivation , and conditioned fear learning .

22974552|Sleep deprivation alters phosphorylated CREB levels in the amygdala : relationship with performance in a fear conditioning task . .

22974552|We investigated the relationship between deficits in fear memory induced by sleep deprivation and pCREB expression in the basal and central nuclei of the amygdala .

22974489|Whereas , SWR/J mice displayed increase only in Pdyn expression in the amygdala and had the lowest conditioned fear .

22972957|Recent findings implicate the central lateral amygdala -LRB- CeL -RRB- in conditioned fear .

22964037|In fact , projection areas of the ventral tegmental area , such as the amygdala and hippocampus , are well established to be involved in the acquisition and expression of fear conditioning , while less is known about the role of the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- and nucleus accumbens -LRB- NAc -RRB- in these processes .

22957066|The aim was to investigate the influence of genetic factors and traumatic life events on skin conductance responses -LRB- SCRs -RRB- and neural responses -LRB- amygdala , insula , dorsal anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- dACC -RRB- and ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- -RRB- during acquisition and extinction learning in a differential fear conditioning paradigm .

22957038|Activation of NF-?B in basolateral amygdala is required for memory reconsolidation in auditory fear conditioning . .

22957038|Here , we demonstrate that inhibition of NF-?B in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , but not central nucleus of the amygdala , after memory reactivation impairs the retention of amygdala-dependent auditory fear conditioning -LRB- AFC -RRB- .

22956667|The present study links amygdala dysfunction in response to fear-relevant stimuli to the willingness of individuals with psychopathic traits to cause fear in other people .

22956667|Psychopathy was associated with reduced activity in right amygdala during judgments of fear-evoking statements and with more lenient moral judgments about causing fear .

22956667|These results implicate amygdala dysfunction in impaired judgments about causing distress in psychopathy and suggest that atypical amygdala responses to fear in psychopathy extend across multiple classes of stimuli .

22952599|Studies addressing posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- have demonstrated that PTSD patients exhibit structural abnormalities in brain regions that relate to stress regulation and fear responses , such as the hippocampus , amygdala , anterior cingulate cortex , and ventromedial prefrontal cortex .

22948412|However , unknown are the effects of 2-heptanone on the firing rate of the basal amygdala , a structure that participates in the expression of fear , and the participation of anterior olfactory epithelial organs , namely the septal organ and vomeronasal organ -LRB- SO-VNO -RRB- .

22936906|Resting-state connectivity of the amygdala is altered following Pavlovian fear conditioning . .

22936906|Neural plasticity in the amygdala is necessary for the acquisition and storage of memory in Pavlovian fear conditioning , but most neuroimaging studies have focused only on stimulus-evoked responses during the conditioning session .

22936906|This study examined changes in the resting-state functional connectivity -LRB- RSFC -RRB- of the amygdala before and after Pavlovian fear conditioning , an emotional learning task .

22936906|The resting-state data show that amygdala connectivity is altered following Pavlovian fear conditioning and that these changes are also related to behavioral outcomes .

22928932|Neural activity and de novo protein synthesis during a rest period following memory retrieval in the amygdala is necessary for stabilization of reactivated fear memory .

22928932|Taken together , these findings indicate that neuronal subpopulations activated during fear memory retrieval preferentially transcribe Arc during subsequent rest in the lateral amygdala .

22918570|Functional imaging , biochemical analysis , and lesion studies with humans have identified the HPA axis and the amygdala as key neuroanatomical regions driving both fear and anxiety .

22917618|Role of sensory input distribution and intrinsic connectivity in lateral amygdala during auditory fear conditioning : a computational study . .

22917611|The lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is critical for processing ecologically salient sensory signals -LRB- e.g. , threatening sounds -RRB- and mediating auditory fear conditioning .

22909130|We have reported that the main olfactory system mediates social buffering of conditioned fear responses in male rats , and this is accompanied by suppression of the lateral and central amygdala .

22909130|On the basis of these results , we suggest that the pmOP links the main olfactory blub to the amygdala and enables social buffering of conditioned fear responses .

22902637|Contextual fear conditioning test induced significant changes in mRNA levels for Syt13 within various brain regions , including lateral amygdala , somatosensory cortex , piriform cortex , habenula , thalamus , and hypothalamus , during both acquisition and retrieval sessions .

22885849|In contrast , decreasing MEF2 function in dentate gyrus and amygdala facilitated the formation of spatial and fear memory , respectively .

22885232|We examined the hypothesis that the absence of STEP facilitates amygdala-dependent behavioral and synaptic plasticity -LRB- i.e. , fear conditioning and long-term potentiation -RRB- using STEP-deficient mice -LRB- STEP KO -RRB- .

22884897|Previously we showed enhanced amygdala-dependent cued fear conditioning in mGluR4 -LRB- - / - -RRB- mice 24 h following training involving two tone-shock pairings .

22879964|These results were closely paralleled by reduced aversive learning signals in the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex , two prominent structures of the neural fear circuit .

22861166|The amygdala is involved in the processing of mood disorders , fear , and the emotional-affective components of pain .

22850830|It is accepted that the amygdala has a central role in processing fear .

22850830|However , it is less widely appreciated that distinct amygdala outputs and downstream circuits are involved in different types of fear .

22850830|Data show that fear of painful stimuli , predators and aggressive members of the same species are processed in independent neural circuits that involve the amygdala and downstream hypothalamic and brainstem circuits .

22832959|Hypervigilance for fear after basolateral amygdala damage in humans . .

22832959|Recent rodent research has shown that the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- inhibits unconditioned , or innate , fear .

22832959|These findings provide the first direct evidence in humans in support of an inhibitory function of the BLA on the brain 's threat vigilance system , which has important implications for the understanding of the amygdala 's role in the disorders of fear and anxiety .

22832732|We have demonstrated that in fear processing condition , an interaction between 5-HTTLPR -LRB- S -RRB- and COMT -LRB- met -RRB- low activity alleles was associated with reduced reciprocal connectivity within the circuitry including bilateral fusiform/inferior occipital regions , right superior temporal gyrus/superior temporal sulcus , bilateral inferior/middle prefrontal cortex and right amygdala .

22820237|The behavioural effect of fear was accompanied by the increased expression of alpha-2 subunits in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus -LRB- DG -RRB- of the HR group .

22814115|The amygdala is not only a critical site for the generation of anxiety and fear , but is involved in the affective processing of sensory information including nociception .

22813977|Evidence suggests that the lateral septum -LRB- LS -RRB- and the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- play opposing roles in the modulation of fear and anxiety .

22800761|First , impaired fear conditioning , reduced cortisol reactivity to stress , amygdala hyporeactivity to negative stimuli , and altered serotonin and noradrenaline neurotransmission suggest low punishment sensitivity , which may compromise the ability of children and adolescents to make associations between inappropriate behaviors and forthcoming punishments .

22790227|-LSB- Role of amygdala subnuclei in fear expression and extinction learning -RSB- . .

22780833|We also found elevation in the amygdala of the protein stathmin 1 , which is known to influence the generation of fear responses .

22764240|While it is well established that amygdala , prefrontal cortex and hippocampus are key brain structures in fear memory processing -LRB- McGaugh , 2004 ; Herry et al. , 2008 ; Likhtik et al. , 2008 -RRB- , it is not well known which neurotransmitters or neuromodulators are involved .

22764240|Human volunteers bearing the -LRB- T -RRB- allele of PDYN -LRB- prodynorphin -RRB- at rs1997794 showed reduced fear extinction and a significantly diminished functional connectivity between amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex .

22739125|The second network involved bilateral amygdala and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex , and these regions also showed increased activity to fear during the Control session .

22738383|Key components of the now well-characterized fear extinction network include the amygdala , hippocampus , and medial prefrontal cortical regions .

22738021|The amygdala , hippocampus , medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- and brain-stem subregions are implicated in fear conditioning and extinction , and are brain regions known to be sexually dimorphic .

22738021|However , during fear conditioning , there were significantly greater BOLD-signal changes in the right amygdala , right rostral anterior cingulate -LRB- rACC -RRB- and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- dACC -RRB- in women compared with men .

22729448|The fear network , comprising the hippocampus , medial prefrontal cortex , amygdala and its brainstem projections , may be abnormally sensitive in PD patients , and respiratory stimulants like CO2 may trigger panic attacks .

22728112|While the amygdalar role in fear conditioning is well established , it also appears to be involved in a wide spectrum of other functions concerning emotional information .

22723702|GABAergic inhibition in the amygdala is essential in regulating fear and anxiety .

22723052|The present study varied the timing of a second retrieval of an established auditory fear memory and followed this second retrieval with infusions of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin -LRB- ANI -RRB- into the basolateral amygdala .

22710915|Activation of TrkB by 7,8-dihydroxyflavone prevents fear memory defects and facilitates amygdalar synaptic plasticity in aging . .

22710915|The present study assessed the effectiveness of 7,8-DHF on age-related declines in fear memories and amygdalar synaptic plasticity .

22710915|The results show that chronic 7,8-DHF treatments significantly enhanced the activation of phosphorylated TrkB at the Y515 and Y816 sites , increased spine density and number in several brain regions that process fear memory including the amygdala , hippocampus , and prefrontal cortex , facilitated basolateral amygdalar synaptic plasticity , and in turn prevented performance in fear conditioning tasks from declining .

22704253|We studied the role of PI3K cascade in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and the infralimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- IL-mPFC -RRB- , in contextual fear learning and extinction in the rat .

22697412|Using the CRND8 transgenic mouse model of amyloidosis , which over-expresses a mutant human amyloid precursor protein -LRB- APP -RRB- gene , we evaluated hippocampus-dependent contextual and amygdala-dependent tone fear conditioned -LRB- FC -RRB- memory , and investigated the relationship between the fear memory indices and A? plaque burden .

22692647|Herein , a ` fear network ' was suggested to mediate fear - and anxiety-related responses : panic attacks result from a dysfunctional coordination of ` upstream ' -LRB- cortical -RRB- and ` downstream ' -LRB- brainstem -RRB- sensory information leading to heightened amygdala activity with subsequent behavioral , autonomic and neuroendocrine activation .

22692647|The assumption of a generally hyperactive amygdala in PD seems to apply more to state than trait characteristics of PD , and involvement of further areas in the fear circuit , such as anterior cingulate and insula , is suggested .

22692566|Specifically , we propose that epigenetic molecular mechanisms underlie the formation and stabilization of context - and cue-triggered fear conditioning based in the hippocampus and amygdala , a conclusion reached in a wide variety of studies using laboratory animals .

22688188|Convergent translational evidence of a role for anandamide in amygdala-mediated fear extinction , threat processing and stress-reactivity . .

22688188|Our findings show that augmenting amygdala anandamide enables extinction-driven reductions in fear in mouse and may promote stress-coping in humans .

22682777|Conditioned fear response is modulated by a combined action of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and dopamine activity in the basolateral amygdala . .

22682777|A third experiment assessed the HPA axis modulation of conditioned fear using in vivo microdialysis targeted at dopaminergic neurotransmission in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

22674260|A metaplasticity-like mechanism supports the selection of fear memories : role of protein kinase a in the amygdala . .

22674260|Furthermore , although a single training trial does not support formation of an observable fear memory , it does result in the phosphorylation of several targets of protein kinase A -LRB- PKA -RRB- in the amygdala .

22674260|Accordingly , blocking PKA signaling in the amygdala before the first training trial completely prevents the ability of that trial to facilitate the formation of long-term fear memory when a second trial is delivered 24 h later .

22666188|In the amygdala , GABAergic neurons in the intercalated medial paracapsular cluster -LRB- Imp -RRB- have been suggested to play a key role in fear learning and extinction .

22665389|Release of gliotransmitters through astroglial connexin 43 hemichannels is necessary for fear memory consolidation in the basolateral amygdala . .

22659643|Here , we demonstrate that foreground context fear memory requires PKM? activity in the amygdala .

22652395|Photoperiod alters fear responses and basolateral amygdala neuronal spine density in white-footed mice -LRB- Peromyscus leucopus -RRB- . .

22652395|Because these photoperiodic changes in brain and behavior mirror some of the etiology of post-traumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- , we hypothesized that photoperiod may also alter fear memory and neuronal morphology within the hippocampus-basolateral amygdala-prefrontal cortex fear circuit .

22643400|To better understand the effect of mGlu7 and mGlu8 receptors on extinction of contextual fear and their critical sites of action in the fear networks , we focused on the amygdala .

22642884|Effects of neonatal amygdala lesions on fear learning , conditioned inhibition , and extinction in adult macaques . .

22642884|Although all lesion studies until now investigated the effect of adult-onset damage on fear conditioning , the current study assessed fear-learning abilities , as measured by fear-potentiated startle , in adult monkeys that had received neonatal neurotoxic amygdala damage or sham-operations .

22642884|Neonatal amygdala damage retarded , but did not completely abolish , the acquisition of a learned fear .

22642884|After acquisition of the fear signal , four of the six animals with neonatal amygdala lesions discriminated between the fear and safety cues and were also able to use the safety signal to reduce the potentiated-startle response and to extinguish the fear response when the air-blast was absent .

22642884|In conclusion , the present results support the critical contribution of the amygdala during the early phases of fear conditioning that leads to quick , robust responses to potentially threatening stimuli , a highly adaptive process across all species and likely to be present in early infancy .

22642884|The neonatal amygdala lesions also indicated the presence of amygdala-independent alternate pathways that are capable to support fear learning in the absence of a functional amygdala .

22641128|The present study examined the possible involvement of the amygdala in behavioral deficits associated with fear memory in a juvenile stress model , with a focus on hippocampal synaptic function .

22641128|These findings suggest that early postnatal stress may cause long-term dysfunction of the modulatory effect of the amygdala on hippocampal function associated with fear memory .

22617672|Lindquist et al. remark that not all fear instances lead to heightened amygdalar activity and , instead , point to roles of the amygdala in detecting '' motivationally salient '' or '' emotionally impactful '' stimuli .

22615481|Post-training unilateral amygdala lesions selectively impair contextual fear memories . .

22615481|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and the dorsal hippocampus -LRB- dHPC -RRB- are both structures with key roles in contextual fear conditioning .

22615481|During fear conditioning , it is postulated that contextual representations of the environment are formed in the hippocampus , which are then associated with foot shock in the amygdala .

22592903|The rat fear-potentiated startle -LRB- FPS -RRB- paradigm is a translational model of conditioned fear involving central amygdala pathways of the brain .

22579802|Increased levels of conditioned fear and avoidance behavior coincide with changes in phosphorylation of the protein kinase B -LRB- AKT -RRB- within the amygdala in a mouse model of extremes in trait anxiety . .

22579802|HAB mice displayed pronounced cued-conditioned fear compared to NAB/CD1 and LAB mice that coincided with increased phosphorylation of the protein kinase B -LRB- AKT -RRB- in the basolateral amygdala 45 min after conditioning .

22571921|Infants also possess a reduced ability to acquire learned aversions or fear , and this behavior is facilitated through attenuated amygdala plasticity to block fear learning .

22563382|The basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is a critical component of the neural circuit regulating fear learning .

22563382|During fear learning and recall , the amygdala and other brain regions , including the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex , exhibit phase-locked oscillations in the high delta/low theta frequency band -LRB- ? 2-6 Hz -RRB- that have been shown to contribute to the learning process .

22553078|Key regions of the fear network , such as amygdala , hypothalamus , peraqueductal grey , or cortical regions seem to be connected by CCKergic pathways .

22530815|Specifically , BDNF gene expression and activation of its high-affinity tropomyosin-related kinase B -LRB- TrkB -RRB- receptor are necessary in the amygdala , hippocampus and prefrontal cortex for the formation of emotional memories , including fear memories .

22529354|Inhibitory input from the PFC to the amygdala controls fear and anxiety typically originating in the amygdala , and disruption of the inhibitory input from the PFC leads to anxiety , fear , and personality changes .

22525015|The hippocampus , basolateral amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex participate in the extinction of inhibitory avoidance and contextual fear conditioning .

22523001|The amygdala is the central component of a functional brain system regulating fear and emotional behaviors .

22523001|We identified different periods of postnatal development of distinct amygdala nuclei and cellular components , which are concomitant with the ontogeny of different fear and emotional behaviors .

22521814|Hippocampal inputs to the amygdala are more focused in higher primates compared to rodents , supporting previous anatomic studies and recent data from human functional imaging studies of contextual fear .

22516520|The neuronal activation marker c-Fos was studied in 24 brain regions relevant for conditioned fear , e.g. in subdivisions of the prefrontal cortex , hippocampus , amygdala , hypothalamic defensive system , brainstem monoaminergic nuclei and periaqueductal gray .

22516107|Current experimental evidence will be discussed suggesting that through feedforward inhibitory effects on specific amygdaloid nuclei IPC neurons participate in the maintenance of basal anxiety as well as in the modulation of unconditioned and conditioned fear , and in the process of fear extinction .

22514524|The lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is a key element in the neural circuit subserving Pavlovian fear-conditioning , an animal model of fear and anxiety .

22511362|These results highlight that fear circuitry could be dysregulated in chronic , pervasive anxiety , and preliminary functional neuroimaging findings suggest that deficient amygdala recruitment could underlie attenuated reflex responding .

22511241|Here , we report changes in gene expression of the GAD65 and GAD67 isoforms of GAD , as measured by relative quantitative real-time RT-PCR , in subregions of the amygdala , hippocampus , and prefrontal cortex 24-26 h after extinction of a recent -LRB- 1-d -RRB- or intermediate -LRB- 14-d -RRB- fear memory .

22509372|Links between synaptic plasticity in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- and Pavlovian fear learning are well established .

22509372|In addition , GRPR KO mice showed enhanced fear evoked by single-trial conditioning and reduced spontaneous firing of neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- .

22509372|However , administration of GRP or the GRPR antagonist -LRB- D-Phe -LRB- 6 -RRB- , Leu-NHEt -LRB- 13 -RRB- , des-Met -LRB- 14 -RRB- -RRB- - Bombesin -LRB- 6-14 -RRB- did not affect amygdala LTP in brain slices , nor did they affect the expression of conditioned fear following intra-amygdala administration .

22509321|Lmo4 in the basolateral complex of the amygdala modulates fear learning . .

22506444|It could inhibit through the GABAergic system the activity of limbic amygdala , which is involved in the response to fear .

22505719|Distinctive roles for amygdalar CREB in reconsolidation and extinction of fear memory . .

22505719|Here we determined the role of CREB selectively within the amygdala in reconsolidation and extinction of auditory fear .

22505719|Viral overexpression of the inducible cAMP early repressor -LRB- ICER -RRB- or the dominant-negative mCREB , specifically within the lateral amygdala disrupted reconsolidation of auditory fear memories .

22505719|In contrast , manipulations of CREB in the amygdala did not modify extinction of fear .

22505719|These findings suggest that the role of CREB in modulation of memory after retrieval is dynamic and that CREB activity in the basolateral amygdala is involved in fear memory reconsolidation .

22502990|Although the contributions of the medial PFC , amygdala , and hippocampus to fear and anxiety have been studied extensively with animal models , the selective roles of the ventral PFC-including the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- vlPFC -RRB- and orbitofrontal cortex-are poorly understood .

22487415|The present study demonstrates that DIO mice show impairment of both hippocampus-dependent contextual and amygdala-dependent cued responses in the fear-conditioning tests , as well as an imbalance in the interaction between the BDNF and NT-3 systems in the cerebral cortex , hippocampus and amygdala related to cognition and fear .

22487247|In rodent studies , repeated stress causes hyperactivity of the amygdala , and increases fear conditioning behavior that is mediated by the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

22484206|The most informative FC was between right amygdala and precuneus , which increased during subliminal fear conditions , while left and right amygdala FC decreased , suggesting a bilateral decoupling of this key limbic region during processing of subliminal fear-related stimuli .

22473056|Aquaporin-4 deficiency impairs synaptic plasticity and associative fear memory in the lateral amygdala : involvement of downregulation of glutamate transporter-1 expression . .

22473056|Therefore , we evaluated long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- and associative fear memory of AQP4 knockout -LRB- KO -RRB- and wild-type mice .

22473056|These findings imply a role for AQP4 in synaptic plasticity and associative fear memory in the amygdala by regulating GLT-1 expression .

22469748|Trace and contextual fear conditioning are impaired following unilateral microinjection of muscimol in the ventral hippocampus or amygdala , but not the medial prefrontal cortex . .

22469748|We temporarily inactivated PL along with either ventral hippocampus or amygdala in a disconnection design to determine if these structures functionally interact to acquire trace fear conditioning .

22469748|Disconnection -LRB- contralateral injections -RRB- of the PL with either the ventral hippocampus or amygdala impaired trace fear conditioning ; however , ipsilateral control rats were also impaired .

22465841|The extended amygdala is thought to play a critical role in adaptive motivational behavior and is implicated in the pathophysiology of maladaptive fear and anxiety .

22464182|Increased proTRH expression of animals exposed to OFT-D was specifically observed in the cortical nucleus of the amygdala , area involved in processing fear stimuli ; these TRH neurons may thus be part of a circuit with anxiolytic properties .

22457511|Epigenetic modulation of Homer1a transcription regulation in amygdala and hippocampus with pavlovian fear conditioning . .

22457511|We then demonstrated that : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Homer1a mRNA increases after fear conditioning in vivo within both amygdala and hippocampus of wild-type mice ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- it increases after BDNF application to primary hippocampal and amygdala cultures in vitro ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- these increases are dependent on transcription and MAPK signaling .

22451349|Fear learning was evident from the differential expressions of fear -LRB- CS -LRB- + -RRB- > CS -LRB- - -RRB- -RRB- at both the behavioral level -LRB- startle potentiation and US expectancy -RRB- and the neural level -LRB- in amygdala , anterior cingulate cortex , hippocampus , and insula -RRB- .

22451349|This revealed that the individual differences in the emotional expression of discriminative fear learning -LRB- startle potentiation -RRB- were reflected in differential amygdala activation , regardless of the cognitive expression of fear learning -LRB- CS-US contingency or hippocampal activation -RRB- .

22450374|Classical Pavlovian fear conditioning to painful stimuli has provided the generally accepted view of a core system centered in the central amygdala to organize fear responses .

22450371|The amygdaloid complex , principally the basolateral complex -LRB- BLA -RRB- , plays a pivotal role in fear memory and in the modulation of stress-induced emotional responses .

22445898|The present study used expression of the immediate early gene c-Fos to examine the effect of amyloid-induced synaptic pathology on neural activity in the hippocampus and amygdala immediately following Pavlovian fear conditioning .

22445898|Tg2576 mice underwent cued fear conditioning and the regional interdependencies of c-Fos expression in the hippocampus and the amygdala were assessed using structural equation modelling .

22440225|The amygdala plays a central role in auditory fear conditioning , regulation of the acoustic startle response and can modulate auditory cortex plasticity .

22437483|Finally , we will address the current knowledge on the neural and pharmacological mechanisms underlying 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalization , which show a substantial overlap with mechanisms known from other research on fear and anxiety , such as those involving the periaqueductal gray or the amygdala .

22432905|Functional cliques in the amygdala and related brain networks driven by fear assessment acquired during movie viewing . .

22432905|Here , we assumed that by using a minimally intrusive cue along with applying a robust clustering approach to probe the amygdala , it would be possible to rate fear in real time and to derive the related network of activation .

22432905|Using graph theory and community mathematical concepts , data-driven clustering of the fear-related functional cliques in the amygdala was performed guided by the individually marked periods of heightened fear .

22424846|This review summarizes the latest developments in our understanding of amygdala networks that support classical fear conditioning , the experimental paradigm most commonly used to study learned fear in the laboratory .

22424846|Because of the introduction of new techniques and the continued use of traditional approaches , it is becoming clear that conditioned fear involves much more complex networks than initially believed , including coordinated interactions between multiple excitatory and inhibitory circuits within the amygdala .

22410078|Variation in these genes showed enhanced amygdala activation during the acquisition and reduced prefrontal activation during the extinction of fear as well as altered amygdala-prefrontal connectivity .

22406441|EUK-207-treated 3xTg-AD mice did not display any deficit in fear conditioning and exhibited reduced A? , tau , and phosphorylated tau accumulation in amygdala and hippocampus , as well as brain levels of A?42 , oxidized nucleic acids , and lipid peroxidation .

22406441|EUK-207-treated 3xTg-AD mice did not display any deficit in fear conditioning and were protected against increases in brain levels of oxidized nucleic acids and lipid peroxidation ; they also had reduced A? , tau , and hyperphosphorylated tau accumulation in amygdala and hippocampus .

22404662|Medial prefrontal dysfunction and prolonged amygdala response during instructed fear processing in borderline personality disorder . .

22386597|Its administration in humans seems to increase trust and reduce fear , in part by directly inhibiting the amygdala .

22378872|Consistent with the observation that PV-Cre ; ErbB4 mice exhibit normal fear conditioning , we find that ErbB4 is broadly expressed in the amygdala , largely by cells negative for PV .

22365465|While rating their fear of fearful faces , both BD and unaffected at-risk subjects exhibited amygdala hyperactivity versus HC .

22365465|We found amygdala hyperactivation in both unaffected at-risk and BD youth while rating their fear of fearful faces .

22334122|Genetic strain differences in learned fear inhibition associated with variation in neuroendocrine , autonomic , and amygdala dendritic phenotypes . .

22334122|Analysis of neuronal morphology in key neural nodes within the fear and extinction circuit revealed enlarged dendritic arbors in basolateral amygdala neurons in S1 , but normal infralimbic cortex and prelimbic cortex dendritic arborization .

22325206|Evoked axonal oxytocin release in the central amygdala attenuates fear response . .

22325206|We found axons of hypothalamic OT neurons in the majority of forebrain regions , including the central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , a structure critically involved in OT-mediated fear suppression .

22325194|Curbing fear by axonal oxytocin release in the amygdala . .

22325194|In this issue of Neuron , Knobloch et al. -LRB- 2012 -RRB- demonstrate that evoked oxytocin release from axon terminals within the central amygdala results in attenuation of fear .

22318762|Resting amygdala and medial prefrontal metabolism predicts functional activation of the fear extinction circuit . .

22318762|Individual differences in a person 's ability to control fear have been linked to activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex , the ventromedial prefrontal cortex , and the amygdala .

22318762|The authors used skin conductance response to index conditioned responding , and they used resting metabolism in the amygdala , the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex , and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex to predict responses during fear extinction and extinction recall .

22312434|Murine GRPR and stathmin control in opposite directions both cued fear extinction and neural activities of the amygdala and prefrontal cortex . .

22308258|The amygdala is a central region that is associated with the generation of fear , and its inactivation diminishes fear .

22308258|From animal studies , the mechanism underlying the anxiolytic effect of SSRIs is hypothesized as follows : SSRIs inhibit the neuronal activities of the amygdala , and this inhibition decreases the level of fear and anxiety .

22298122|Prevention of stress-impaired fear extinction through neuropeptide s action in the lateral amygdala . .

22298122|Here we test the hypothesis that neuropeptide S can regulate stress-induced hyperexcitability in the amygdala , and thereby can interact with stress-induced alterations of fear memory .

22298122|Furthermore , patch-clamp recordings were performed in amygdala slices prepared ex vivo to identify synaptic substrates of stress-induced alterations in fear responsiveness .

22298122|-LRB- 1 -RRB- IS increased anxiety-like behavior , and enhanced conditioned fear responses during extinction 10 days after stress , -LRB- 2 -RRB- neuropeptide S in the amygdala prevented , while an antagonist aggravated , these stress-induced changes of aversive behaviors , -LRB- 3 -RRB- excitatory synaptic activity in LA projection neurons was increased on fear conditioning and returned to pre-conditioning values on fear extinction , and -LRB- 4 -RRB- stress resulted in sustained high levels of excitatory synaptic activity during fear extinction , whereas neuropeptide S supported the return of synaptic activity during fear extinction to levels typical of non-stressed animals .

22298122|Together these results suggest that the neuropeptide S system is capable of interfering with mechanisms in the amygdala that transform stressful events into anxiety and impaired fear extinction .

22275851|Based primarily on studies that employ Pavlovian fear conditioning , extinction of conditioned fear has been found to be mediated by N-methyi-D-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- receptors in the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex .

22275851|This led to the discovery that an NMDA partial agonist , D-cycloserine , could facilitate fear extinction when given systemically or locally into the amygdala .

22275850|The amygdala seems to be a crucial structure for fear and anxiety , and has consistently been found to be activated in anxiety-provoking situations .

22275850|Apart from the amygdala , the insula and anterior cinguiate cortex seem to be critical , and ail three have been referred to as the '' fear network . ''

22270846|The amygdalae are involved in the perception of emotions such as happiness , anger and fear .

22249157|The projections of the infralimbic area -LRB- IL -RRB- of the medial prefrontal cortex to the intercalated nuclei -LRB- ICNs -RRB- of the amygdala are thought to form a critical component of the forebrain circuitry for fear extinction .

22249157|These findings suggest that the putative role of the IL-to-ICN connection in fear inhibition may be mediated by light to moderate projections from the IL to the medial ICN , and that the CITZ may be an equally important amygdalar target for this function .

22249137|Conditioned fear is supported by a distributed network that prominently includes lateral and central amygdaloid nuclei .

22249137|The role of corticomedial amygdaloid nuclei , including the medial nucleus -LRB- MeA -RRB- , in fear acquisition or expression is not well understood .

22232580|Next we investigated the potential neural substrates underlying the acute anxiogenic effects by analyzing the morphological and physiological impact of acute fluoxetine treatment on principal neurons of the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , a brain area that plays a pivotal role in fear and anxiety .

22227508|mGluR4 -LRB- - / - -RRB- mice also showed enhanced amygdala-dependent cued fear conditioning .

22218285|While rare patients with focal bilateral amygdala lesion typically show impaired recognition of fearful faces , this deficit is variable , and an intriguing possibility is that other brain regions can compensate to support fear and social signal processing .

22210508|Substance P by acting on its preferred receptor neurokinin 1 -LRB- NK1 -RRB- in the amygdala appears to be critically involved in the modulation of fear and anxiety .

22210508|Our data add to previous localization studies by describing an unexpected variation between LA and basal nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BA -RRB- in the neurochemical phenotype of NK1-expressing neurons and reveal the relative source of glutamatergic inputs that may activate these neurons , which in turn regulate fear and anxiety responses .

22207842|With this study we provide the first experimental evidence showing that temporarily inactivating the amygdala before training impairs auditory fear learning when there is a temporal gap between the tone and the shock .

22206966|A fear memory engages a subset of lateral amygdala neurons , but whether multiple contextual fear memories engage the same or different subsets of lateral amygdala neurons remains unclear .

22206966|Here , we demonstrate the representation of multiple contextual fear memories in the amygdala with cellular and temporal resolution using a large-scale imaging method .

22206966|These findings indicate that lateral amygdala neurons related to different fear memories are partly common , and that a small but significant neuronal population -LRB- 2.7 % of total lateral amygdala neurons -RRB- encodes differences in individual fear memories .

22198970|As a main result , we observed a positive correlation of social anxiety and conditioning responses on the subjective level -LRB- valence and fear -RRB- as well as on the neural level with significant CS -LRB- + -RRB- / CS -LRB- - -RRB- differentiation in the left amygdala and the left hippocampus .

22194792|Similar neural activity during fear and disgust in the rat basolateral amygdala . .

22194792|Here we test the hypothesis that the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , a region known to be important for learned fear and other affects , encodes affective valence by comparing neuronal activity in the BLA during a conditioned fear stimulus -LRB- fear CS -RRB- with activity during intraoral delivery of an aversive fluid that induces a disgust response and a rewarding fluid that induces a hedonic response .

22174310|Myosin II motor activity in the lateral amygdala is required for fear memory consolidation . .

22174310|In this study , we report that Myosin II motors in the rat lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- are essential for fear memory formation .

22173014|In particular , a network comprising the ventral hippocampus and amygdala nuclei was found in the fear acquisition group , whereas a closed reciprocal dorsal hippocampal network was detected in the fear expression group .

22169439|Concussive brain injury enhances fear learning and excitatory processes in the amygdala . .

22169439|Fear learning was assessed over subsequent days and chronic changes in fear learning and memory circuitry were assessed by measuring N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits and glutamic acid decarboxylase , 67 kDa isoform protein levels in the hippocampus and basolateral amygdala complex -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

22164138|In conclusion , we demonstrate that Ras-GRF1 has no unique role in spatial memory while its function in contextual fear conditioning is likely to be due not only to its involvement in amygdala functions but possibly to some distinct hippocampal connections specific to contextual learning .

22158512|Long-term synaptic enhancements in cortical and thalamic auditory inputs to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LAn -RRB- mediate encoding of conditioned fear memory .

22155030|Footshock compared to no-shock controls elicited significant increases in rCBF in limbic/paralimbic regions implicated in the processing of unconditioned fear and ultrasonic vocalization , including the amygdala , hypothalamus , lateral septum , dorsal periaqueductal gray , the anterior insular -LRB- aINS -RRB- and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- .

22148946|Until recently , a dominant model attributed this disposition to reductions in the threshold for engaging the circuitry supporting fear learning , particularly the amygdala .

22114293|Hippocampal and prefrontal projections to the basal amygdala mediate contextual regulation of fear after extinction . .

22114293|Recent work in fear extinction paradigms reveals that the contextual regulation of fear involves a neural network involving the hippocampus , medial prefrontal cortex , and amygdala .

22114293|The amygdaloid basal nuclei -LRB- BA -RRB- receive convergent input from the ventral hippocampus -LRB- VH -RRB- and prelimbic -LRB- PL -RRB- prefrontal cortex and may integrate VH and PL input to regulate fear expression .

22113213|Although the role of the amygdala in processing facial expressions of fear is well established , its role in the processing of other emotions , such as sadness , remains unclear .

22113213|We suggest the fact that such delicate sad masks could activate the amygdala , and it could possibly be because of an underlying similarity to emotions such as fear and disgust .

22110089|The emotional circuits for fear have been well documented through studies demonstrating that lesions to the amygdala will block both conditioned and unconditioned fear behaviors .

22102841|These findings suggest that the aberrant amygdala and insula activation to fear-evocative probes previously characterized in PTSD may be driven by an underlying enhanced connectivity between the amygdala , a region known for perceiving threat and generating fear responses , and the insula , a region known for processing the meaning and prediction of aversive bodily states .

22101302|A similar mechanism does not appear to occur in lateral amygdala neurons , in spite of the robust behavioural and cellular modifications induced in such structure by cued fear conditioning .

22100849|In addition , it was shown that re-test of a conditioned fear increased the number of cells expressing GluN2B subunits in the basolateral amygdala , dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and secondary motor cortex -LRB- M2 -RRB- in the HR group relative to the LR group .

22100273|Distribution of dopamine D -LRB- 2 -RRB- - like receptors in the rat amygdala and their role in the modulation of unconditioned fear and anxiety . .

22085880|Acute brain slice electrophysiology and immunostaining of inhibitory neurons were used to identify neuronal circuit alterations of the amygdala and hippocampus associated with changes in extinction of fear learning in rats following PCP treatment .

22085880|The impairment of LTP at both amygdalar and hippocampal microcircuits , which play a key role in processing relevant survival information such as fear and extinction memory concurred with a disruption of extinction learning of fear conditioned responses .

22085720|We examined the effects of treadmill running -LRB- TR -RRB- and wheel running -LRB- WR -RRB- on the Pavlovian fear conditioning task that assesses learning and memory performance associated with the amygdala -LRB- cued conditioning -RRB- and both the amygdala and hippocampus -LRB- contextual conditioning -RRB- .

22085720|Injection of K252a , a TrkB kinase inhibitor , in the dorsal hippocampus or basolateral amygdala abolished the exercise-facilitated contextual or cued fear learning and memory performance , respectively , regardless of the types of exercise .

22083603|In contrast , a role of BDNF in mediating synaptic plasticity and fear learning in the amygdala is just beginning to evolve .

22079527|Late-phase long-term potentiation -LRB- L-LTP -RRB- of excitatory synaptic transmission at thalamic input synapses onto the lateral amygdala -LRB- T-LA synapses -RRB- has been proposed as a cellular substrate for long-term fear memory .

22079507|Two hours post-injection , participants underwent an fMRI procedure to assess amygdala reactivity during the presentation of socially threatening images -LRB- fear faces -RRB- as well as non-socially threatening images -LRB- guns -RRB- , socially non-threatening images -LRB- happy faces -RRB- , and non-social , non-threatening images -LRB- household objects -RRB- .

22071630|In addition , in line with the SA 's role in fear attenuation -LRB- presumably to facilitate caregiving during stress -RRB- , increased SA activity during support giving was associated with reduced left -LRB- r = -0.44 , p < .05 -RRB- and right -LRB- r = -0.42 , p < .05 -RRB- amygdala activity .

22043125|Contextual fear is followed by significant reductions in rapid eye movement sleep -LRB- REM -RRB- that are regulated by the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CNA -RRB- .

22041183|In the basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , one of the main regions for fear and extinction learning of the brain , various forms of long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- have been described for excitatory glutamatergic synapses .

22039511|Adult-onset hypothyroidism enhances fear memory and upregulates mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors in the amygdala . .

22039511|The potentiation of emotional memory under hypothyroidism was associated with an increase of corticosterone release after fear conditioning and with higher expression of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors in the lateral and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala , nuclei that are critically involved in the circuitry of fear memory .

22039511|Furthermore , our findings suggest that enhanced corticosterone signaling in the amygdala is involved in the pathophysiological mechanisms of fear memory potentiation .

22031894|The fear circuit revisited : contributions of the basal amygdala nuclei to conditioned fear . .

22031894|The lateral nucleus -LRB- LA -RRB- is the input station of the amygdala for information about conditioned stimuli -LRB- CSs -RRB- , whereas the medial sector of the central nucleus -LRB- CeM -RRB- is the output region that contributes most amygdala projections to brainstem fear effectors .

22028394|Memory for delay fear conditioning requires the synthesis of new mRNA and protein in the basolateral amygdala .

22028394|It is currently unknown whether similar molecular processes in the amygdala are required for the formation of trace fear memory , in which a stimulus-free interval is inserted between the conditional stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- and unconditional stimulus -LRB- UCS -RRB- .

22028394|Here , we show that infusion of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin into the basolateral amygdala disrupts consolidation of both trace and delay fear conditioning .

22028394|This is the first evidence that protein synthesis in the amygdala is necessary for the formation of both trace and delay fear memory .

22023893|Nitric oxide synthesis in the basolateral complex of the amygdala is required for the consolidation and expression of fear potentiated startle but not shock sensitization of the acoustic startle . .

22023893|The targets of NO include cellular components within the basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- that are necessary for the consolidation of conditioned fear as well as targets that can significantly modulate neurotransmission associated with its expression .

22019361|The amygdala is strongly associated with fear processing , and alterations in amygdala function and structure have been demonstrated in schizophrenia .

22019361|In the present study , we examine the effective connectivity corresponding to fear processing , from the amygdala to the whole brain , and compare this between patients with schizophrenia and control participants .

22011126|Case report : anxiety and fear in a patient with meningioma compressing the left amygdala . .

22011126|The amygdalae are an important part of fear and anxiety circuits in the mammalian brain , involved in the encoding and storage of fear memories .

22008369|Consistent with this elevated non-social fear , individuals with Williams syndrome have an abnormally elevated amygdala response when viewing threatening non-social stimuli .

22001285|We have previously demonstrated that the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is a key component of a neural circuit mediating memory formation for emotionally relevant stimuli in an ethologically-based model of conditioned fear , termed conditioned defeat -LRB- CD -RRB- .

21976500|These experiments examined the effect of 200 ng of FGF2 , infused bilaterally into the basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , on the extinction of conditioned fear in adult rats .

21969490|Context fear learning specifically activates distinct populations of neurons in amygdala and hypothalamus . .

21969490|In previous studies , we identified a discrete population of neurons in the lateral amygdala that show learning-specific activation of a c-fos-regulated transgene following context fear conditioning .

21969490|These findings suggest that a series of discrete populations of neurons are involved in fear learning in amygdala and hypothalamus .

21964522|Since the amygdala is critically involved in fear conditioning we examined here whether maternal deprivation regulates dendritic complexity in this area .

21964522|Although a brief period of maternal deprivation increases fear conditioned responses , it did not affect dendritic complexity in the basolateral amygdala .

21963442|The most prevalent mental disorders , anxiety and mood disorders , are associated with both functional and morphological brain changes that commonly involve the ` fear network ' including the -LRB- medial -RRB- prefrontal cortex , hippocampus and amygdala .

21963362|These findings provide initial evidence suggesting that while the mPFC is involved in memory retrieval , MAPK phosphorylation in the amygdala may be a persisting neural signature of fear memory .

21961035|Activity dependent protein degradation is critical for the formation and stability of fear memory in the amygdala . .

21961035|However , its role in memory formation in the amygdala , a site critical for the formation of fear memories , currently remains unknown .

21922004|After the association , CS input is conveyed through the amygdala to different brain regions including the hippocampus for contextual fear formation , to the supramammillary and thalamic paraventricular nuclei for stressful anxiety or memory dependent fearful or stressful emotion , to the reward system to induce aversive expression to the CS , or hedonic shift from positive to negative , and to the CS-responsive neurons in the gustatory system to enhance the responsiveness to facilitate to detect the harmful stimulus .

21917789|In the amygdala during fear memory formation , we found that many Wnt-signaling genes were dynamically regulated , with an immediate decrease , followed by an eventual normalization during memory consolidation .

21912749|The amygdala is known to be a critical brain region for emotional fear .

21912749|It is believed that synaptic plasticity within the amygdala is the cellular basis of fear memory .

21868438|We first show that the acetylation of histone 3 -LRB- H3 -RRB- , but not histone 4 -LRB- H4 -RRB- , is regulated following auditory fear memory retrieval in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- .

21861391|The influence of systemic injection of anxiolytic afobazole -LRB- 1 mg/kg -RRB- on interaction between neurons of the basal and central amygdaloor nuclei and behavior of rabbits in negative emotional situations was studied in order to reveal characteristics of amygdalar neuronal network properties during unconditioned fear .

21818344|Social defeat : impact on fear extinction and amygdala-prefrontal cortical theta synchrony in 5-HTT deficient mice . .

21818344|In conclusion , extinction learning and memory of conditioned fear can be modulated by both the 5-HTT gene activity and social experiences in adulthood , accompanied by corresponding alterations of the theta activity in the amygdala-prefrontal cortex network .

21808614|Evidence indicates that fear learning leads to changes in neuronal synaptic transmission and morphology in brain areas underlying fear memory formation including the amygdala and hippocampus .

21807003|The amygdala and the prefrontal cortex , brain regions involved in anxiety and fear , mood , cognitive function and behavioral control , also show structural plasticity .

21800302|The central extended amygdala is the major output center for telencephalic control of ingestion , fear responses , stress , and anxiety .

21738775|Signals related to fear memory and extinction are processed within brain pathways involving the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- for formation of aversive stimulus associations , the CA1 area of the hippocampus for context-dependent modulation of these associations , and the infralimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- for extinction processes .

21731599|We used functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- to compare amygdala blood-oxygenation-level-dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- responses to non-social and social images in individuals with Williams syndrome compared to either individuals with inhibited temperament -LRB- high non-social fear -RRB- or individuals with uninhibited temperament -LRB- high sociability -RRB- .

21731599|Individuals with Williams syndrome had larger amygdala BOLD responses when viewing the non-social fear images than the inhibited temperament control group .

21731599|In contrast , when viewing both fear and neutral social images , individuals with Williams syndrome did not show smaller amygdala BOLD responses relative to the uninhibited temperament control group , but instead had amygdala responses proportionate to their sociability .

21731599|These results suggest heightened amygdala response to non-social fear images is characteristic of WS , whereas , variability in amygdala response to social fear images is proportionate to , and might be explained by , levels of trait sociability .

21729104|Phobic fear is accompanied by intense bodily responses modulated by the amygdala .

21729104|Memory encoding during phobic fear therefore seems contingent on amygdala 's influence on arousal and parahippocampal activity .

21697388|In rodents , fear memory is stored and reactivated under the influence of the amygdala .

21697388|There is no evidence for an equivalent mechanism in primates , and an opposite mechanism is proposed whereby primate amygdala contributes only to an initial phase of aversive learning , subsequently ceding fear memory to extra-amygdalar regions .

21697388|These data highlight that the human basolateral and centro-cortical amygdala support initial learning as well more enduring fear memory storage .

21689772|Role of amygdala-prefrontal cortex circuitry in regulating the expression of contextual fear memory . .

21689772|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- are inter-connected regions involved in fear memory expression .

21684526|These data lend support to a growing body of evidence that chronic fear is mediated in the basolateral amygdala and BNSTlv and that environmental factors that modulate fear during stress will alter the long-term consequences of the stressor .

21677169|GABAA receptor endocytosis in the basolateral amygdala is critical to the reinstatement of fear memory measured by fear-potentiated startle . .

21562275|Interestingly , amygdala glucocorticoid receptor expression was reduced in the maternally stressed mice , and administration of glucocorticoids -LRB- GCs -RRB- immediately after fear conditioning and LTP induction restored memory consolidation and LTP maintenance , respectively , suggesting that a weakening of GC signaling was responsible for the observed impairment .

21562275|Together , these findings suggest that prenatal stress induces long-term dysregulation of nongenomic GC action in the amygdala of adult offspring , resulting in the impairment of fear memory consolidation .

21562269|In the present study , we examined the role of Arc/Arg3 .1 in the reconsolidation of an amygdala-dependent auditory pavlovian fear memory .

21394851|Postretrieval ?-adrenergic stimulation in the amygdala enhances reconsolidation of fear memories , making them resistant to extinction .

21385565|We have recently developed an ex vivo model where during fear memory deconsolidation and reconsolidation the synaptic state can be monitored at thalamic input synapses onto the lateral amygdala -LRB- T-LA synapses -RRB- , a storage site for auditory fear memory .

21382385|These results suggest differential involvement of structures within the fear network in symptom manifestation and in recovery from PTSD : whereas activity within the amygdala and vmPFC appeared to be a marker of current symptom severity , functional changes in the hippocampus and sgACC reflected recovery .

21377513|In mutant mice lacking NE , induction of Fos was normal in all regions of the hippocampus and amygdala shortly after fear conditioning .

21283812|Double dissociation of amygdala and hippocampal contributions to trace and delay fear conditioning . .

21283812|A key finding in studies of the neurobiology of learning memory is that the amygdala is critically involved in Pavlovian fear conditioning .

21283812|This is well established in delay-cued and contextual fear conditioning ; however , surprisingly little is known of the role of the amygdala in trace conditioning .

21283812|It is possible that recruitment of cortical structures by trace conditioning alters the role of the amygdala compared to delay fear conditioning , where the CS and US overlap .

21283812|To investigate this , we inactivated the amygdala of male C57BL/6 mice with GABA -LRB- A -RRB- agonist muscimol prior to 2-pairing trace or delay fear conditioning .

21283812|These findings demonstrate that insertion of a temporal gap between the CS and US can generate amygdala-independent fear conditioning .

21282604|In the basolateral amygdala complex , it has been demonstrated that CB -LRB- 1 -RRB- is particularly enriched in axon terminals of cholecystokinin -LRB- CCK -RRB- - positive GABAergic interneurons , induces short - and long-term depression at inhibitory synapses , and is involved in extinction of fear memory .

21277950|We used a fear-potentiated startle paradigm to investigate the effects of a motor-eliciting stimulus in the presence or absence of induction of an acute fear state on serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus -LRB- DR -RRB- and cells in subdivisions of the central amygdaloid nucleus -LRB- CE -RRB- , a structure that plays an important role in fear responses , using induction of the protein product of the immediate-early gene , c-Fos .

21264642|Expectation and temperament moderate amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex responses to fear faces . .

21264642|In contrast , those with an uninhibited temperament had a smaller amygdala but larger dorsal anterior cingulate cortex BOLD response when expecting to see fear faces .

21264324|Pavlovian fear conditioning activates a common pattern of neurons in the lateral amygdala of individual brains . .

21264324|Although it has been established that the lateral amygdala is a key site for encoding associative fear memory , it is currently unclear whether the spatial distribution of neurons encoding a given memory is random or stable .

21264324|Here we used spatial principal components analysis to quantify the topography of activated neurons , in a select region of the lateral amygdala , from rat brains encoding a Pavlovian conditioned fear memory .

21264324|Our results demonstrate a stable , spatially patterned organization of amygdala neurons are activated during the formation of a Pavlovian conditioned fear memory .

21263037|The data suggest a trend toward a negative correlation between amygdala volume and fear acquisition magnitude .

21258326|We examined whether protein kinase M zeta -LRB- PKM? -RRB- inhibition in the amygdala permanently disrupts fear memory by testing retention at various intervals after PKM? blockade .

21258265|Leptin replacement also normalized the hypertension , stress-linked immobility , conditioned fear , and amygdala enlargement seen in neonatal growth restricted male mice .

21256439|Affective neuroscience : amygdala 's role in experiencing fear . .

21256439|A new neuropsychological study of a rare patient provides novel evidence that amygdala lesions can virtually abolish the experience of fear , illuminating neurobiological mechanisms of fear experience .

21256233|The psychophysiological expression of generalized fear correlated with amygdala activity , and connectivity between the amygdala and extrastriate visual cortex was correlated with individual differences in trait anxiety .

21244716|Previous studies have shown that fear memories are consolidated through the activation of gene expression in the amygdala and hippocampus , indicating essential roles of these brain regions in memory formation .

21244716|However , it is still poorly understood whether gene expression in brain regions other than the amygdala/hippocampus is required for the consolidation of fear memory ; however , several brain regions are known to play modulatory roles in fear memory formation .

21242990|The amygdala is a key brain region involved in threat detection and fear regulation , and previous animal studies have suggested that stress sensitizes amygdala responsivity and reduces its regulation by the prefrontal cortex .

21240917|This study aimed to study the role of protein synthesis and actin rearrangement in the CA1 hippocampal subregion and the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- in acquisition and reacquisition of contextual fear conditioning .

21220344|This temporary suppression of contextual fear was associated with blunted synaptic activity in the basal amygdala and decreased PI3K and MAPK signaling in the hippocampus .

21211549|Serial connections through the amygdaloid complex linked with the oro-laryngo-pharyngeal musculature appear quite distinct from those believed to sub-serve fear responses , suggesting there are distinct '' channels '' for the acquisition and expression of particular conditioned behaviors .

21209214|Central amygdala activity during fear conditioning . .

21209214|The central amygdala -LRB- Ce -RRB- , particularly its medial sector -LRB- CeM -RRB- , is the main output station of the amygdala for conditioned fear responses .

21209214|The large increase in the incidence of CeL -LRB- - -RRB- but not CeL -LRB- + -RRB- cells from conditioning to recall leads us to propose a model of fear conditioning involving the potentiation of an extrinsic inhibitory input -LRB- from the amygdala or elsewhere -RRB- to CeL , ultimately leading to disinhibition of CeM neurons .

21203784|Within prominent structures of the fear network -LRB- amygdala , insula , prefrontal cortex -RRB- neural dynamics mirrored the description of the attack very well for one of the patients .

21195749|During the consolidation of fear memory , it has been shown that GABA -LRB- A -RRB- receptors -LRB- GABA -LRB- A -RRB- R -RRB- are rapidly downregulated in amygdala .

22832658|Cnp1 -LRB- KO -RRB- mice also displayed reduced fear expression during extinction , despite normal amygdala c-Fos induction after acute stress , together implicating dysfunction of an amygdala-related neural network , and consistent with proposed mechanisms for stress resiliency .

22738227|Both fear and pain processing are altered in post-traumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- , as evidenced by functional neuroimaging studies showing increased amygdala responses to threats , and increased insula , putamen and caudate activity in response to heat pain .

22432955|In comparison to their healthy counterparts , young women with BPD showed -LRB- 1 -RRB- lower connectivity between bilateral amygdala and mid-cingulate cortex during the neutral scan ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- higher connectivity between bilateral amygdala and rostral anterior cingulate cortex during the overt fear scan ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- higher right amygdala connectivity with bilateral thalamus and right caudate during the masked fear scan .

22432955|However , the connectivity findings during fear processing are novel , and map onto basic research models for amygdala connectivity , that is , connections to frontal areas for overt fear processing versus connections to thalamus for automatic fear processing .

21182851|Neuroimaging studies have reported greater activation of the human amygdala in response to emotional facial expressions , especially for fear .

21179518|The lateral amygdala is a key site for synaptic plasticity underlying conditioned fear , which can both trigger and be coincident with the stress response .

21177377|Early growth response gene 1 -LRB- Egr-1 -RRB- is required for new and reactivated fear memories in the lateral amygdala . .

21177377|In the present study , we have examined the role of EGR-1 in the consolidation and reconsolidation of amygdala-dependent auditory Pavlovian fear conditioning .

21177377|In our first series of experiments , we show that EGR-1 is regulated following auditory fear conditioning in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- .

21172318|Measuring Pavlovian fear with conditioned freezing and conditioned suppression reveals different roles for the basolateral amygdala . .

21172318|Studies of Pavlovian fear conditioning measuring freezing have demonstrated the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- to be critical to both fear learning and memory .

21168912|Exogenous urocortin-2 increased the conditioned fear-induced expression of c-Fos in the central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , and parvocellular neurons of the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus -LRB- pPVN -RRB- , and revealed the effect of conditioned fear in the medial amygdala -LRB- MeA -RRB- .

21167712|The human amygdala and the induction and experience of fear . .

21167712|Although clinical observations suggest that humans with amygdala damage have abnormal fear reactions and a reduced experience of fear , these impressions have not been systematically investigated .

21167712|The findings support the conclusion that the human amygdala plays a pivotal role in triggering a state of fear and that the absence of such a state precludes the experience of fear itself .

21164371|The amygdaloid complex is involved in anxiety or fear responses to stressful stimuli .

21152344|Beta-adrenergic receptors in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala contribute to the acquisition but not the consolidation of auditory fear conditioning . .

21152344|We focused on manipulations of ?ARs in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- because of the well-established contribution of this area to fear conditioning .

21152344|These findings indicate that amygdala ?ARs are important for the acquisition but not the consolidation of fear conditioning .

21148026|The role of the amygdala in the mediation of fear and anxiety has been extensively investigated .

21144858|The present study suggests that contextual and auditory fear conditioning is impaired in GD-exposed rats possibly due to neuropathology observed in the hippocampus , amygdala and thalamus .

21133534|These results provide evidence for the involvement of amygdaloid dopamine in regulating surprise in fear and therefore predictive learning via a direct outcome processing mechanism .

21130104|This type of fear conditioning , in which both the hippocampus and amygdala are critically involved , allows studying the formation and extinction of fear related memories .

21122818|It has been proposed that the anxiolytic effects of alcohol are mediated via the amygdala , an area critical to fear perception and responding .

21115817|Fear is a defensive mechanism evolved to protect animals from danger by balancing the animals ' needs for primary resources with the risk of predation , and the amygdala is implicated in mediating fear responses .

21115817|However , the functions of fear and amygdala in foraging behavior are not well characterized because of the technical difficulty in quantifying prey-predator interaction with real -LRB- unpredictable -RRB- predators .

21115817|These results indicate that the amygdala bidirectionally regulates risk behavior in rats foraging in a dynamic fear environment .

21113608|FMRI data revealed activations in areas associated with the fear circuit including amygdala , insula , and hippocampal areas .

21108955|It has been reported that bilateral amygdala damage in humans compromises the recognition of fear and anger in nonverbal vocalizations -LRB- Scott et al. , 1997 -RRB- .

21108955|The results confirmed for the first time that unilateral amygdala lesion including the basolateral complex can selectively impair recognition of fear and surprise expressed by voices , supporting the notion that the amygdala is a multimodal structure .

21108955|Interestingly , this impairment was observed in patients with incomplete resection of the amygdala that spared the central nucleus and the corticomedial complex , suggesting that a resection of the basolateral complex is sufficient to affect fear recognition .

21106836|Interaction between N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor and GluR2 is essential for fear memory formation in lateral amygdala . .

21106836|To assess possible roles of NSF-GluR2 interaction in rat lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- in fear memory formation we used a specific GluR2-NSF interaction inhibitory peptide -LRB- pep-R845A -RRB- .

21094675|In addition , mice with a disruption of GR specifically within the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- are deficient in conditioned fear behavior .

21093597|The central amygdala nucleus via corticotropin-releasing factor is necessary for time-limited consolidation processing but not storage of contextual fear memory . .

21093597|The central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- is traditionally portrayed in fear conditioning as the key neural output that relays conditioned information established in the basolateral amygdala complex to extra-amygdalar brain structures that generate emotional responses .

21093597|However , several recent studies have questioned this serial processing view of the amygdalar fear conditioning circuit by showing an influence of the CeA on memory consolidation .

21093547|Nuclear protein phosphatase-1 : an epigenetic regulator of fear memory and amygdala long-term potentiation . .

21093547|PP1 is abundant in brain structures involved in emotional processing like the amygdala , it may therefore be involved in the regulation of fear memory , a form of memory related to post-traumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- in human .

21093547|Here , we demonstrate that PP1 is a molecular suppressor of fear memory and synaptic plasticity in the amygdala that can control chromatin remodeling in neurons .

21093462|Recent interest in the amygdala arises from its role in processing fear and the relationship of fear to human anxiety .

21075593|Relative to PTSD and control subjects , PD patients demonstrated significantly less activation to the Threat condition and increased activity to the Safe condition in the subgenual cingulate , ventral striatum and extended amygdala , as well as in midbrain periaquaeductal grey , suggesting abnormal reactivity in this key region for fear expression .

21073972|Previous data suggest that overtraining can overcome fear conditioning deficits in rats with lesions of the basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

21073972|We have previously shown that the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CEA -RRB- is essential for the acquisition and expression of conditional fear to both contextual and auditory conditioned stimuli -LRB- CSs -RRB- after overtraining .

21073925|Fourth , levels of extracellular signal-related kinase -LRB- ERK1/2 -RRB- and cyclic AMP response element binding protein -LRB- CREB -RRB- phosphorylation , downstream of NO signaling , were determined in the amygdala as potential correlates of fear learning .

21068837|Encoding of conditioned fear in central amygdala inhibitory circuits . .

21068837|The central amygdala -LRB- CEA -RRB- , a nucleus predominantly composed of GABAergic inhibitory neurons , is essential for fear conditioning .

21068837|Using in vivo electrophysiological , optogenetic and pharmacological approaches in mice , we show that neuronal activity in the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala -LRB- CEl -RRB- is required for fear acquisition , whereas conditioned fear responses are driven by output neurons in the medial subdivision -LRB- CEm -RRB- .

21068836|Genetic dissection of an amygdala microcircuit that gates conditioned fear . .

21068836|The role of different amygdala nuclei -LRB- neuroanatomical subdivisions -RRB- in processing Pavlovian conditioned fear has been studied extensively , but the function of the heterogeneous neuronal subtypes within these nuclei remains poorly understood .

21068303|Extinction-induced erasure of fear occurs in very young rats , but is lost with the development of perineuronal nets in the amygdala that render fear memories impervious to extinction .

21059963|With the use of a modified behavioral approach task within functional MRI , we show that , as a tarantula was placed closer to a subject 's foot , increased experiences of fear coincided with augmented activity in a cascade of fear-related brain networks including the periaqueductal gray , amygdala , and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis .

21054349|Impaired extinction of fear and maintained amygdala-hippocampal theta synchrony in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy . .

21054349|Therefore , this project was set up to characterize the neurophysiologic basis of seizure-related fear and the contribution of the amygdala-hippocampus system .

21054349|The experimental strategy was composed of the following steps : -LRB- 1 -RRB- use of the mouse pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy -LRB- TLE -RRB- ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- behavioral analyses of anxiety states in the elevated plus maze test , light-dark avoidance test , and Pavlovian fear conditioning ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- probing neurophysiologic activity patterns in amygdala-hippocampal circuits in freely behaving mice .

21054349|However , during fear memory extinction , SRS mice showed an extended freezing behavior and a maintained amygdala-hippocampal theta frequency synchronization compared to controls .

21054349|These results indicate specific alterations in conditioned fear behavior and related neurophysiologic activities in the amygdala-hippocampal network contributing to impaired fear memory extinction in mice with TLE .

21052083|Morphine withdrawal decreased ERK phosphorylation in the amygdala after cued fear extinction , especially in HDC-KO mice .

21048893|Norepinephrine -LRB- NE -RRB- is thought to play a key role in fear and anxiety , but its role in amygdala-dependent Pavlovian fear conditioning , a major model for understanding the neural basis of fear , is poorly understood .

21048893|The lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is a critical brain region for fear learning and regulating the effects of stress on memory .

21036893|Zinc transporter 3 -LRB- ZnT3 -RRB- knock-out -LRB- KO -RRB- mice are well suited to test the role of zinc in learned fear , because ZnT3 is colocalized with synaptic zinc , responsible for its transport to synaptic vesicles , highly enriched in the amygdala-associated neural circuitry , and ZnT3 KO mice lack Zn ² + in synaptic vesicles .

21036893|However , earlier work reported no deficiency in fear memory in ZnT3 KO mice , which is surprising based on the effects of Zn ² + on amygdala synaptic plasticity .

21036893|Thus , ZnT3 is involved in associative fear memory and extinction , but not in innate fear , consistent with the role of synaptic zinc in amygdala synaptic plasticity .

20980994|Short-term adaptation of conditioned fear responses through endocannabinoid signaling in the central amygdala . .

20980994|The cannabinoid receptor type 1 -LRB- CB1 -RRB- and the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- are both known to have crucial roles in the processing of fear and anxiety , whereby they appear to be especially involved in the control of fear states .

20980994|Upon application of AM251 in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- in an otherwise identical protocol , no such acute behavioral effects were detected , but CB1 blockade resulted in increased fear responses during tone exposures on the subsequent days .

20976279|Here , we report a genome-wide study of gene expression changes associated with conditioned fear -LRB- CF -RRB- memory in wild-type and DKO mice to identify AC-dependent gene regulatory changes that occur in the amygdala and hippocampus at baseline and different time points after CF learning .

20974156|In vivo levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone and gastrin-releasing peptide at the basolateral amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex in response to conditioned fear in the rat . .

20974156|Given the modulatory effect of exogenously administered corticotropin-releasing hormone -LRB- CRH -RRB- and gastrin-releasing peptide -LRB- GRP -RRB- on conditioned fear , the present study sought to measure the fear-induced endogenous release of CRH and GRP at the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- and basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- using in vivo microdialysis .

20971127|In male mice , four weeks of social isolation induces behavioral dysfunctions such as aggression , fear , and anxiety-like behavior associated with a decrease in allopregnanolone biosynthesis in selected corticolimbic structures comprising the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , olfactory bulb , hippocampus , and medial prefrontal cortex .

20963825|Endogenous GluR1-containing AMPA receptors translocate to asymmetric synapses in the lateral amygdala during the early phase of fear memory formation : an electron microscopic immunocytochemical study . .

20963825|The paradigm of pavlovian fear conditioning -LRB- FC -RRB- can be used to address this question , because a discrete region-the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- - has been shown unambiguously to be necessary for the formation of the associative memory between a neutral stimulus -LRB- tone -LSB- CS -RSB- -RRB- and a noxious stimulus -LRB- foot shock -LSB- US -RSB- -RRB- .

20962768|Dissociable roles of prelimbic and infralimbic cortices , ventral hippocampus , and basolateral amygdala in the expression and extinction of conditioned fear . .

20962768|Current models of conditioned fear expression and extinction involve the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , ventral medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- , and the hippocampus -LRB- HPC -RRB- .

20962768|We suggest a model in which amygdala-dependent fear expression is modulated by inputs from PL and vHPC , whereas extinction memory requires extinction-induced plasticity in IL , BLA , and/or vHPC .

20955808|Conditioned fear is modulated by D2 receptor pathway connecting the ventral tegmental area and basolateral amygdala . .

20955808|Among the forebrain regions innervated by this pathway , the amygdala is an essential component of the neural circuitry of conditioned fear .

20955808|The functional role of the dopaminergic pathway connecting the VTA to the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- in fear and anxiety has received little attention .

20955808|These findings indicate that the dopamine D -LRB- 2 -RRB- receptor pathway connecting the ventral tegmental area and the basolateral amygdala modulates fear and anxiety and may be a novel pharmacological target for the treatment of anxiety .

20943906|We performed whole-cell recordings of pyramidal neurons in the PAM -LRB- + / - -RRB- amygdala to elucidate neurophysiological correlates of the fear behavioral phenotypes .

20939663|In contrast , exposure to negatively valenced events involving a reduction in expected food rewards after bar pressing or presentation of a footshock during fear conditioning produced significant increases in norepinephrine output sampled from only the right but not left basolateral amygdala .

20939658|Unexpected , but not expected , conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- - unconditioned stimulus -LRB- US -RRB- presentations caused increased c-Fos expression in the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- , midline thalamus , lateral amygdala , as well as retrograde labeled midline thalamic afferents to PFC. Reversible inactivation of dorsomedial PFC , but not infralimbic PFC , prevented the associative blocking of fear learning .

20936683|This experiment examined synaptic structural plasticity in the lateral amygdala which is critical for the acquisition of the conditioned fear response .

20936683|This finding suggests that an increase in synaptic compliment in the amygdala may underlie the acquisition of the conditioned fear response .

20933543|Reversible inactivation of the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- disrupts the acquisition and expression of conditioned defeat -LRB- CD -RRB- , an ethological model of conditioned fear , suggesting that the BLA may be a critical component of the neural circuit mediating behavioral plasticity associated with the experience of social defeat .

20933543|There is ample evidence , however , that the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor in the amygdala is critical for mediating long-term potentiation and plasticity related to fear learning .

20889725|The central amygdala nucleus -LRB- CeA -RRB- plays a critical role in cognitive processes beyond fear conditioning .

20884329|The lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is a critical structure involved in fear conditioning .

20870745|Antagonism of lateral amygdala alpha1-adrenergic receptors facilitates fear conditioning and long-term potentiation . .

20861367|Reversible inactivation of the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- via muscimol , systemic injection of the NMDA receptor -LRB- NMDAr -RRB- antagonist MK-801 -LSB- -LRB- + -RRB- -5 - methyl-10 ,11 - dihydro-5H-dibenzo -LSB- a , d -RSB- cyclohepten-5 ,10 - imine maleate -RSB- , or intra-amygdala infusion of the NMDAr NR2B subunit selective antagonist ifenprodil impaired both acquisition and extinction of fear to S2 .

20856811|Long-term memory for pavlovian fear conditioning requires dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and basolateral amygdala . .

20846178|To assess a potential function of CNGA3 in the mouse amygdala and hippocampus , we examined synaptic plasticity and performed a comparative analysis of spatial learning , fear conditioning and step-down avoidance in wild-type mice and CNGA3 null mutants -LRB- CNGA3 -LRB- - / - -RRB- -RRB- .

20846178|In contrast , CNGA3 -LRB- - / - -RRB- mice showed markedly reduced freezing to the conditioned tone in the amygdala-dependent cued fear conditioning task .

20846178|Despite the dissociation between physiological and behavioral parameters , our data describe a so far unrecognized role of CNGA3 in modulation of hippocampal plasticity and amygdala-dependent fear memory .

20833253|Western blotting revealed that exposure of HR animals to fear-conditioned context upon re-test of the conditioned fear test elevated the concentration of alpha-2 subunits in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex .

20833253|In addition , immunocytochemistry showed that conditioned fear increased the number of cells co-expressing alpha-2 subunits and gephyrin in the basolateral amygdala and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in the HR group .

20832497|Paired trials of CS-US -LRB- unconditioned stimulus -RRB- were applied to anesthetized rats , a condition that allows for amygdala-based fear conditioning but not cerebellar-based motor conditioning .

20818541|Conscious and unconscious processing of fear after right amygdala damage : a single case ERP-study . .

20818541|Our study suggests that the right amygdala is necessary for explicit recognition of fear , while implicit recognition of fear and classical conditioning may still occur following lesion of the right amygdala .

20817153|Research on the neural circuitry underlying fear extinction has led to the examination of D-cycloserine -LRB- DCS -RRB- , a partial agonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in the amygdala , as a method to enhance exposure therapy outcome .

20813244|Classic fear conditioning , for example , is dependent upon NMDA-type glutamate receptor activation in the lateral/basolateral amygdala followed by increased synaptic expression of AMPA-type glutamate receptors .

20807585|The effects of midazolam and D-cycloserine on the release of glutamate and GABA in the basolateral amygdala of low and high anxiety rats during extinction trial of a conditioned fear test . .

20807585|In these rats , we examined the effects of both drugs on the release of glutamate and GABA in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- during the first extinction trial of a conditioned fear test .

20807583|Thus , chronic stress impacts amygdala-mediated fear learning in both OVX - and gonadally-intact females as found previously in males , with handling significantly influencing these outcomes .

20797541|The central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- serves as a major output of this structure and plays a critical role in the expression of conditioned fear .

20797530|Petrified or aroused with fear : the central amygdala takes the lead . .

20797530|In this issue of Neuron , Gozzi , Jain , and colleagues suggest that neurons in the central amygdala orchestrate output signals toward either the brainstem or cholinergic basal forebrain and thereby can shift fear reactions from passive to active .

20740074|Conversely , blocking NMDA receptors in the amygdala disrupted the formation of fear extinction memory , but opioid receptor blockade in the same brain area did not .

20730787|After PN10 and with the decline of the SHRP , stress-induced CORT release permits amygdala activation and facilitates learned odor aversions and fear .

20730787|Remarkably , odor preference and attenuated fear learning can be reestablished in PN10-15 pups if the mother is present , an effect due to her ability to suppress pups ' CORT and amygdala activity .

20730419|DOR mRNA and protein are expressed in the central nucleus of the amygdala , a region that plays an important role in processing fear , stress , and anxiety .

20720535|Oxytocin attenuates amygdala reactivity to fear in generalized social anxiety disorder . .

20714708|The goal of the present study was to investigate whether juvenile stress influences emotional control via postsynaptic 5-HT -LRB- 1A -RRB- receptor in the hippocampus and amygdala using contextual fear conditioning test in adult rats .

20709330|Activations located in the amygdala and in the extrastriate body area might reflect fear of weight gain , representing one of the core symptoms of anorexia nervosa .

20703199|We suggest a dual explanatory mechanism as to why oxytocin may be effective : through a reduction of fear response -LRB- decreasing amygdala activation , inhibiting fear response , and enhancing extinction learning -RRB- and through an increase of social interaction -LRB- activating social reward-related brain regions increasing engagement in the therapeutic alliance -RRB- .

20693389|These results confirm the independence of conditioned amygdala responses from contingency awareness and indicate specific neural circuits for different aspects of fear acquisition in unaware , learned aware and instructed aware subjects .

20689940|GABA -LRB- A -RRB- ? receptor mechanisms in the rat amygdala and its role in the modulation of fear and anxiety . .

20689940|This work was conducted to study whether GABA -LRB- A -RRB- ? receptors may have a putative role in the amygdaloid modulation of fear and anxiety .

20689940|It is suggested that GABA -LRB- A -RRB- ? receptors may have a role in the amygdaloid modulation of fear and anxiety .

20685338|Moreover , scopolamine infusions attenuated phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase -LRB- ERK -RRB- in the amygdala , indicating that cholinergic signals in the DH are important for trace fear conditioning .

20679237|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is thought to be essential for fear learning .

20673801|Enhanced activations within the fear network -LRB- medial prefrontal cortex , anterior cingulate cortex , amygdala , insula and thalamus -RRB- were observed in response to the phobia-related conditioned stimulus .

20673801|The results imply that learned phobic fear is based on exaggerated responses in structures belonging to the fear network and emphasize the importance of the amygdala in the processing of phobic fear .

20668188|The amygdala showed increased functional connectivity with ventral visual system regions during fear awareness and increased connectivity with perigenual prefrontal cortex -LRB- pgPFC ; Brodmann 's area 32/10 -RRB- when fear was suppressed .

20666145|The amygdala is a brain structure that is critically involved in the processing of memory and emotion , including fear and anxiety .

20660260|Discriminative auditory fear learning requires both tuned and nontuned auditory pathways to the amygdala . .

20660260|To test this hypothesis we assessed the effect of electrolytic lesions to the ventral , or medial , division of the medial geniculate nucleus -LRB- MGv or MGm , which correspond , respectively , to the lemniscal and the nonlemniscal auditory pathway to amygdala -RRB- on the acquisition , expression and extinction of fear responses in discriminative auditory fear conditioning , where one tone is followed by shock -LRB- conditioned stimulus , CS -LRB- + -RRB- -RRB- , and another is not -LRB- CS -LRB- - -RRB- -RRB- .

20660101|Following injection , mice demonstrate impaired amygdala-dependent cued fear conditioning , as well as impairments in an amygdala-dependent nonassociative social recognition task .

20659172|Increased susceptibility for developing exaggerated fear responses was accompanied by decreased long-term depression and increased surface trafficking of the AMPA receptor GluR1 subunit at the level of the basolateral amygdala complex .

20655906|Corticotropin-releasing factor increases serotonin release in the central nucleus of the amygdala , and this neurochemical circuitry may play a role in mediating fear and anxiety states .

20655508|Learning in three tasks , for which memory consolidation has been shown to depend on local synaptic refinement in areas of interest -LRB- hippocampus-dependent declarative word-pair learning , amygdala-dependent fear conditioning , and primary-cortex-dependent visual texture discrimination -RRB- , was assessed in 23 inpatients who met International Classification of Disease , 10th Revision , criteria for severe unipolar depression and 35 nondepressed comparison subjects .

20647005|This is problematic because the hippocampus receives extensive afferent input from both the amygdala and the septum , which also play very important roles in fear and fear memory .

20631192|Reactivation of fear memory renders consolidated amygdala synapses labile . .

20620879|Conversely , activity in a set of interrelated temporal lobe structures , including the amygdala , was attenuated as the level of fear increased when choosing to overcome fear .

20615999|Optical activation of lateral amygdala pyramidal cells instructs associative fear learning . .

20615999|Activation of lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- pyramidal neurons by aversive stimuli is thought to drive the formation of these associative fear memories ; yet , there have been no direct tests of this hypothesis .

20608470|One possibility is T. gondii 's preferential localisation to , and effects within the amygdala ; this is particularly intriguing , given the role of this brain structure in the normal fear response .

20601946|Neural substrates for expectation-modulated fear learning in the amygdala and periaqueductal gray . .

20601946|Theory and evidence suggest that instructive UCS inputs to the amygdala will be inhibited when the UCS is expected , but this has not been found during fear conditioning .

20601946|We investigated neural pathways that relay information about the UCS to the amygdala by recording neurons in the amygdala and periaqueductal gray -LRB- PAG -RRB- of rats during fear conditioning .

20601946|Pharmacological inactivation of the PAG attenuated UCS-evoked responses in the amygdala and impaired acquisition of fear conditioning , indicating that PAG may be an important part of the pathway that relays instructive signals to the amygdala .

20600645|Further supporting this conclusion , pharmacological inactivation experiments showed that expression of both freezing and turning behaviors depended upon lateralized circuits in the amygdala and periaqueductal gray -LRB- PAG -RRB- that are known to support expression of Pavlovian fear responses .

20600184|SM is a patient with complete bilateral amygdala lesions who fails to fixate the eyes in faces and is consequently impaired in recognizing fear -LRB- Adolphs et al. , 2005 -RRB- .

20589492|However , MD animals showed an improved amygdala-dependent fear memory .

20576499|In PTSD-susceptible B6N mice , long-term maintenance of contextual and sensitized fear was accompanied by -LRB- i -RRB- increased levels of phosphorylated AKT within the dorsal hippocampus and -LRB- ii -RRB- higher levels of phosphorylated AKT and GSK-3beta and increased beta-catenin levels within the basolateral amygdala .

20574537|Synaptic plasticity and NO-cGMP-PKG signaling regulate pre - and postsynaptic alterations at rat lateral amygdala synapses following fear conditioning . .

20574537|In the present study , we show that auditory Pavlovian fear conditioning is associated with significant and long-lasting increases in the expression of the postsynaptically-localized protein GluR1 and the presynaptically-localized proteins synaptophysin and synapsin in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- within 24 hrs following training .

20569648|In this article , I review the results of my research group ; these results show that particular neurons in the lateral amygdala , a brain region important for fear , are specifically involved in particular fear memories .

20569648|Finally , we showed that selective ablation of the neurons overexpressing CREB in the lateral amygdala selectively erased the fear memory .

20550755|Fear conditioning involves the amygdala as the main neural structure for learning fear responses whereas fear extinction mainly activates the inhibitory prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- .

20550755|In this study we investigated whether individual differences in trait anxiety affect amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- dACC -RRB- activation during fear conditioning and extinction .

20550755|This study reveals that high levels of trait anxiety are associated with both increased amygdala activation and reduced dACC recruitment during the extinction of conditioned fear .

20550755|This hyper-responsivity of the amygdala and the deficient cognitive control during the extinction of conditioned fear in anxious subjects reflect an increased resistance to extinct fear responses and may thereby enhance the vulnerability to developing anxiety disorders .

20529116|Here , we analysed the role of PN-1 in the acquisition and extinction of classical auditory fear conditioning , two distinct forms of learning that both depend on NMDAR activity in the amygdala .

20529116|Consistent with a role for the basal nucleus of the amygdala in fear extinction , we found that , compared with wild-type -LRB- WT -RRB- littermate controls , PN-1 KO mice exhibited decreased numbers of Fos-positive neurons in the basal nucleus after extinction .

20529116|Together , these data indicate that lack of extinction in PN-1 KO mice is associated with distinct changes in neuronal activity across the circuitry of the basal and central nuclei and the ITCs , supporting a differential impact on fear extinction of these amygdala substructures .

20528979|Thus , the inappropriate activation of the medial amygdala evoked by specific fear or aversive stimuli may be key to the neurogenic hypertension .

20525079|NMDA receptor antagonism in the basolateral but not central amygdala blocks the extinction of Pavlovian fear conditioning in rats . .

20525079|Glutamate receptors in the basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- are essential for the acquisition , expression and extinction of Pavlovian fear conditioning in rats .

20525079|Recent work has revealed that glutamate receptors in the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CEA -RRB- are also involved in the acquisition of conditional fear , but it is not known whether they play a role in fear extinction .

20525079|In contrast , infusion of the N-methyl-D-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- receptor antagonist , D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid -LRB- APV -RRB- , into the amygdala , spared the expression of fear to the CS during extinction training , but impaired the acquisition of a long-term extinction memory .

20525079|These results reveal that AMPA and NMDA receptors within the amygdala make dissociable contributions to the expression and extinction of conditioned fear , respectively .

20514925|Animal research demonstrated that during fear conditioning the amygdala plays a central role in forming an association between the conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- and the unconditioned stimulus -LRB- US -RRB- .

20514925|In the current study , a differential fear conditioning task was presented to a unilaterally amygdala-damaged patient group and a healthy control group , recording fear-potentiated startle responses along with SCRs .

20514925|Unlike the control group , unilaterally amygdala-damaged patients showed neither in their SCRs nor in their valence ratings an effect of fear conditioning .

20514925|Based on these findings we concluded that the fear conditioning impairment in amygdala-damaged patients was not restricted to SCRs , but also affected valence ratings and memory of the presented contingency .

20493273|Early in eyeblink classical conditioning , amygdala-dependent fear responding is reported to facilitate acquisition of the cerebellar-dependent eyeblink conditioned response -LRB- CR -RRB- , in accord with the two-process model of conditioning -LRB- Konorski , 1967 -RRB- .

20493271|Substantia nigra , nucleus basalis magnocellularis and basolateral amygdala roles in extinction of contextual fear conditioning in the rat . .

20493271|Recent results show that both the substantia nigra and nucleus basalis magnocellularis , two sites strongly connected with the basolateral amygdala are also involved in the consolidation of contextual fear conditioning .

20493271|The aim of the present work is to investigate if latter two sites , besides the basolateral amygdala , are also involved in the extinction of the conditioned fear response .

20491283|The effect of antipsychotics attenuates the dopamine fear response in the amygdala , modulating basal dopamine level .

20487031|In the amygdala , its expression is regulated only by contextual fear conditioning and not by exposure to a novel context .

20485675|We also observed that fear conditioning enhances local field potential activity within the basolateral amygdala .

20484636|Developmental origin of the neuronal subtypes that comprise the amygdalar fear circuit in the mouse . .

20484636|We have taken a genetic-based fate-mapping approach to determine the specific contributions of telencephalic progenitors to the structures that comprise the amygdalar fear circuit including the central -LRB- CA -RRB- , lateral -LRB- LA -RRB- , and basolateral -LRB- BLA -RRB- amygdala .

20484636|Thus , our findings indicate diverse origins for the neuronal components that comprise the amygdalar fear circuit .

20483568|Anger expression positively covaried with amygdala activation to crude fear , while trait anger negatively covaried with amygdala responses to detailed fear .

20466051|The medial geniculate , not the amygdala , as the root of auditory fear conditioning . .

20466051|The neural basis of auditory fear conditioning -LRB- AFC -RRB- is almost universally believed to be the amygdala , where auditory fear memories are reputedly acquired and stored .

20462889|Since amygdalar responses are associated with fear and fear conditioning in other species , higher levels of brain activation when fighting a mirror suggest fish experience fear in response to fights with a mirror image .

20451622|MDD relative to non-MDD individuals showed greater activity during fear matching trials in the amygdala and other emotion processing structures , lower activity during fear matching trials in emotional control structures such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and lower fractional anisotropy -LRB- FA -RRB- in several white matter tracts including the superior longitudinal fasciculus -LRB- SLF -RRB- .

20416387|Disruption of fear memory consolidation and reconsolidation by actin filament arrest in the basolateral amygdala . .

20416352|In the current study , we examined the effects of D-serine on fear extinction and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase -LRB- ERK -RRB- in the hippocampus , basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- during the process of fear extinction .

20410874|First , numerous studies have shown that pre - and post-training administration of drugs that facilitate GABAergic transmission disrupt the initial formation of fear memories , indicating a role for GABA -LRB- A -RRB- receptors , possibly within the amygdala and hippocampus , in the acquisition and consolidation of fear memories .

20405238|Substantial evidence has implicated regions of the central extended amygdala , including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- and the central nucleus of the amygdala as critical structures mediating fear - and anxiety-like behavior in both humans and animals .

20403415|Increases in extracellular zinc in the amygdala in acquisition and recall of fear experience and their roles in response to fear . .

20403415|When this recall was performed under perfusion with CaEDTA , a membrane-impermeable zinc chelator , to examine the role of the increase in extracellular zinc , the time of freezing behavior was more increased , suggesting that zinc released in the lateral amygdala during the recall of fear participates in freezing behavior .

20403415|The present paper demonstrates that zinc released in the lateral amygdala may participate in emotional behavior in response to fear .

20400272|These data suggest that retrieval of fear memory in ethanol withdrawn rats affected ethanol consumption and that amygdala may be involved in this effect .

20396642|One patient who had a lesion relatively restricted to the amygdala and hippocampus experienced difficulty in recognizing fear from facial expressions .

20396642|In contrast , the other patient who had a lesion that extended beyond the amygdala experienced difficulty in recognizing fear from non-facial -LRB- prosodic and written verbal -RRB- stimuli .

20393190|Plastic synaptic networks of the amygdala for the acquisition , expression , and extinction of conditioned fear . .

20393190|We will focus on Pavlovian fear conditioning as a model and the amygdala as a key component for the acquisition and extinction of fear responses .

20383136|We found that inactivating PKMzeta in the amygdala impaired fear memory in rats and that the extent of the impairment was positively correlated with a decrease in postsynaptic GluR2 .

20381628|These findings are in line with the supposed double dissociation of fear conditioning and declarative knowledge relative to the amygdala and hippocampus in humans .

20381628|Interventions targeting the amygdalar fear memory may be essential in specifically and persistently dampening the emotional impact of fear .

20381473|When expressed in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , ERGR reduced anxiety , as tested on elevated plus-maze and open field , without affecting conditioned fear , another amygdala-dependent behavior .

20351057|Synaptic plasticity and NO-cGMP-PKG signaling coordinately regulate ERK-driven gene expression in the lateral amygdala and in the auditory thalamus following Pavlovian fear conditioning . .

20351057|We have recently hypothesized that NO-cGMP-PKG signaling in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- during auditory fear conditioning coordinately regulates ERK-driven transcriptional changes in both auditory thalamic -LRB- MGm/PIN -RRB- and LA neurons that serve to promote pre - and postsynaptic alterations at thalamo-LA synapses , respectively .

20348916|We found that exposure to the unconditioned stimulus initiates an unconditioned stimulus-specific reconsolidation of learned fear in rats that depended on the amygdala .

20348916|Thus , specific features of the unconditioned stimulus appear to be encoded in the amygdala as part of fear memories stored there .

20332204|We found that overnight bidirectional changes in fear memory were selectively correlated with modifications in theta coherence between the amygdala , medial prefrontal cortex , and hippocampus during paradoxical sleep .

20331854|Besides the amygdala , of which emotion roles have been intensively studied , the cerebellum has also been demonstrated to play a critical role in simple classical fear conditioning in both mammals and fishes .

20303474|Accumulating clinical evidence indicates the efficacy of DCS in the facilitation of amygdala-dependent fear extinction learning in patients with phobic , social anxiety , panic , and obsessive-compulsive disorder .

20303254|Although fear research has largely focused on the amygdala , recent findings highlight cortical control of the amygdala in the service of fear regulation .

20303254|Both IL and PL integrate inputs from the amygdala , as well as other structures to gate the expression of fear via projections to inhibitory or excitatory circuits within the amygdala .

20300199|GABA -LRB- C -RRB- Receptors in the Lateral Amygdala : A Possible Novel Target for the Treatment of Fear and Anxiety Disorders ? .

20300199|Activation of GABA -LRB- A -RRB- Rs in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- , a key site of plasticity underlying fear learning , impairs fear learning .

20299204|Meanwhile , increasingly specific lesion/inactivation studies reveal that the amygdala is necessary for processes -- for example , fear extinction and reinforcer devaluation -- that involve updating representations of value .

20298749|Furthermore , NPS was directly injected into the amygdala , the central site of the neural fear circuitry .

20298749|This strongly supports a crucial role of amygdaloid NPS in conditioned fear .

20298722|Contributions of the amygdala central nucleus and ventrolateral periaqueductal grey to freezing and instrumental suppression in Pavlovian fear conditioning . .

20298722|The central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- and the ventrolateral periaqueductal grey -LRB- vlPAG -RRB- has been strongly implicated in the acquisition and expression of conditioned fear .

20226213|The current studies address the hypothesis that the long-lived escape deficit produced by uncontrollable stress is dependent upon conditioned fear and the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

20224887|Given the role of the nNOS gene in fear conditioning , we investigated whether systemic administration of modulators of NO signaling affect the formation of contextual and cued fear memories and the effects of these modulators on cyclic 3 ' 5 ' - guanosine monophosphate -LRB- cGMP -RRB- levels in the hippocampus and amygdala .

20208529|Synaptic correlates of fear extinction in the amygdala . .

20208529|We found that fear extinction in rats was associated with increased levels of synaptic inhibition in fear output neurons of the central amygdala -LRB- CEA -RRB- .

20208529|This increased inhibition resulted from a potentiation of fear input synapses to GABAergic intercalated amygdala neurons that project to the CEA .

20200600|Left amygdala activation differed among the three affects , showing reductions to masked anger and increases to masked fear and happy faces .

20200600|During masked fear , left amygdala activation correlated positively with extrastriate cortex and temporal poles and negatively with precuneus and middle cingulate gyrus .

20173685|Oxytocin attenuates neural responses to aversive pictures and has been associated with reduced coupling of amygdala to brainstem regions involved in the fear response .

20171263|We have shown recently that the cGMP-dependent protein kinase Type I -LRB- cGKI -RRB- plays an important role for the consolidation of amygdala-dependent fear memory and long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- in the lateral amygdala .

20171263|The representation of fear memory in the lateral amygdala strikingly depends on the activity of CREB in individual neurons .

20171263|To demonstrate a link from cGKI to activation of CREB and CREB-dependent transcription in neurons of the lateral amygdala as a possible mechanism for cGKI-mediated fear memory consolidation , we examined the effect of cGMP on activation of CREB/CRE using immunohistochemical staining specific for phospho-CREB and a reporter gene in control and cGKI-deficient mice , respectively .

20171263|In summary , we provide evidence that cytosolic cGKI can support fear memory consolidation and LTP in neurons of the lateral amygdala via activation of CREB and CRE-dependent transcription .

20161806|Using auditory Pavlovian fear conditioning , we show that synaptic plasticity and NO signaling in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- regulate the expression of the ERK-driven immediate early gene early growth response gene I -LRB- EGR-1 -RRB- in regions of the auditory thalamus that are presynaptic to the LA. .

20154357|We examined the roles of the amygdala and hippocampus in the formation of emotionally relevant memories using an ethological model of conditioned fear termed conditioned defeat -LRB- CD -RRB- .

20154354|Role of the basolateral amygdala in the reinstatement and extinction of fear responses to a previously extinguished conditioned stimulus . .

20154354|Four experiments used rats to study the role of the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- in the reinstatement and extinction of fear responses -LRB- freezing -RRB- to a previously extinguished conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- .

20150341|Research into the neural underpinnings of fear and fear-related pathology has highlighted the role of the amygdala .

20150341|For instance , bilateral damage to the amygdaloid complex is associated with decreased appreciation of danger and recognition of fear in humans , whereas enlarged amygdala volume is associated with internalizing syndromes .

20141730|Combining the TCM theory with the modern psychological theory on stress , and from the points of views of the emotion regulation , the formation , consolidation , extraction and extinction of fear memory , and the plasticity of amygdala-hippocampus-prefrontal cortex nervous pathway , as well as the results of pharmacological studies of prescriptions and herbs for invigorating the kidney , the authors explained in this article the pathological mechanisms of kidney deficiency due to attack of fear , and revealed the material basis , the action modes , and the neurobiological mechanisms of the kidney in controlling and regulating emotional activity .

20141276|Aware BDNF met-carriers show a deficit in amygdala-dependent fear conditioning as indicated by an absence of FPS responses in the last acquisition block .

20141261|Both men and women with PTSD showed enhanced amygdala activity to fear relative to controls .

20139013|A greater number of COMT Met alleles predicted increased activation in brainstem , amygdala , basal ganglia and medial prefrontal regions for conscious fear , but decreased activation for conscious happiness .

20128847|Extinction of cued fear memory involves a distinct form of depotentiation at cortical input synapses onto the lateral amygdala . .

20128847|The amygdala is known to be a critical storage site of conditioned fear memory .

20128847|Among the two major pathways to the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- , the cortical pathway is known to display a presynaptic long-term potentiation which is occluded with fear conditioning .

20128847|pp-LFS-induced depotentiation -LRB- ex vivo -RRB- required NMDA receptor -LRB- NMDAR -RRB- activity , consistent with a previous finding that blockade of amygdala NMDARs impaired fear extinction .

20120731|-LSB- Interaction and firing pattern of rabbit amygdalar neurons in the state of unconditioned fear manifested as freezing -RSB- . .

20120731|In order to reveal characteristics of functioning of amygdalar neuronal network during unconditioned fear , firing patterns of basal and central nuclear neurons and their interaction were studied during freezing -LRB- fear -RRB- , active unconditioned motor reactions -LRB- in the absence of fear -RRB- to emotionally significant stimuli , and during quiet wakefulness .

20120731|It was concluded that , for the development of fear , the balance between excitatory and inhibitory links of amygdalar neuronal network is essential .

20116110|The amygdala and the limbic system are important in inducing a fear reaction ; if this '' fear network '' is involved in panic disorder , panic patients might be more sensitive to fear stimuli than healthy subjects .

20110085|The lateral -LRB- LA -RRB- and central -LRB- CE -RRB- , but not basal -LRB- B -RRB- , amygdala nuclei are necessary for reactive Pavlovian fear responses such as freezing .

20100550|In conclusion , although the specific test conditions were sufficient to evoke behavioral alterations in exploration in the elevated plus-maze , they were enough to induce significant Fos protein expression in piriform cortex , septal nucleus and thalamic and hypothalamic paraventricular nuclei but not in other areas such as dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus and amygdala nuclei , known to be also active participants in circuits controlling fear and anxiety .

20092575|Distinct contributions of the amygdala and hippocampus to fear expression . .

20092575|The present study attempted to distinguish the independent contributions of the amygdala and hippocampus to fear expression .

20074223|Converging lines of evidence suggest that synaptic plasticity at auditory inputs to the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is critical for the formation and storage of auditory fear memories .

20059553|The role of NCAM in auditory fear conditioning and its modulation by stress : a focus on the amygdala . .

20059553|Effects of chronic stress on the amygdala have been linked to a facilitation of fear conditioning .

20059553|In this study , we investigated whether altered NCAM expression levels in the amygdala might be related to stress-induced enhancement of auditory fear conditioning and anxiety-like behavior .

20059553|In adult C57BL/6J wild-type mice , chronic unpredictable stress resulted in an isoform-specific increase of NCAM expression -LRB- NCAM-140 and NCAM-180 -RRB- in the amygdala , as well as enhanced auditory fear conditioning and anxiety-like behavior .

20059553|Strikingly , forebrain-specific conditional NCAM-deficient mice -LRB- NCAM-floxed mice that express the cre-recombinase under the control of the promoter of the alpha-subunit of the calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II -RRB- , whose amygdala NCAM expression levels are reduced , displayed impaired auditory fear conditioning which was not altered following chronic stress exposure .

20059553|Together , our results strongly support the involvement of NCAM in the amygdala in the consolidation of auditory fear conditioning and highlight increased NCAM expression in the amygdala among the mechanisms whereby stress facilitates fear conditioning processes .

20053894|The basolateral amygdala complex -LRB- BLA -RRB- has been identified as a critical structure mediating fear extinction .

20045736|The present study investigated event-related neural responses during processing of facial emotions in the unattended hemifield using magnetoencephalography -LRB- MEG -RRB- and found activations of the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex to fear as early as 100 ms. The right amygdala exhibited temporally dissociated activations to input from different visual fields , suggesting early subcortical versus later cortical processing of fear .

21461354|Long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- at thalamic input synapses to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- has been proposed as a cellular mechanism of the formation of auditory fear memories .

20036466|These results suggest that impaired fear inhibition and associated alterations in HPA feedback may reflect amygdala hyperactivity in subjects with PTSD .

20036269|Our findings provide support for a model of abnormal social fearlessness by showing that in WS , abnormal amygdala response to fear is paired with an increased tendency to approach strangers .

20036269|These findings contribute to our understanding of social and emotional functioning in neurodevelopmental conditions and provide evidence that in WS , amygdala response to fear modulates social behavior .

20035015|Long-term synaptic changes in two input pathways into the lateral nucleus of the amygdala underlie fear extinction . .

20017134|By contrast , amygdala damage did not affect explicit perception of fearful expressions nor a distinct emotional ERP effect at 150-250 ms. These results demonstrate two distinct time-points at which the amygdala influences fear processing .

20016086|The amygdala , hippocampus , and prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- have all been suggested to be key brain areas in extinction of conditioned fear .

20016086|Extinction of conditioned fear was examined in Gad65 -LRB- - / - -RRB- mice while recording local field potentials from the amygdala , hippocampus , and PFC simultaneously while monitoring behavior .

20016086|This endurance in cued fear was associated with theta frequency synchronization between the amygdala and hippocampus .

20016086|The data imply that GAD65 plays a critical role in regulating cued fear responses during extinction learning and that , during this process , GABAergic signaling is involved in modulating synchronized activity between the amygdala and hippocampus .

20016086|In view of the more pronounced effect on cued versus contextual fear extinction , these influences may rely more on GABAergic mechanisms in the amygdala .

20011048|An event-related beamformer source analysis model was applied in three time windows following the first face presentations : 80 to 130 ms , 140 to 190 ms , and 210 to 260 ms. The frontal lobe and the right internal temporal lobe part , including the amygdala , reacted as soon as 80 ms of latency to fear occurring in the peripheral vision .

20003620|Here , we further investigate its putative involvement in amygdala and hippocampus functions during context fear memory formation .

20003620|Using laser capture microdissection and quantitative RT-PCR , we show high NCAM mRNA expression levels in the lateral and basolateral subnuclei of the amygdala , as well as their training intensity - and context-dependent regulation during fear memory consolidation .

20003620|Moreover , we demonstrate that deficits of NCAM - / - mice in context fear memory can be overcome through contextual pre-exposure , i.e. by reducing the modulatory influence of the amygdala on this hippocampus-dependent memory .

20003620|Together , these results suggest an involvement of NCAM-mediated cell recognition processes in information processing of the amygdalo-hippocampal system and in the amygdala-mediated modulation of context fear memory according to stimulus salience .

19995614|Late expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the amygdala is required for persistence of fear memory . .

19995614|The level of growth-associated protein 43 -LRB- GAP-43 -RRB- , a marker of newly formed synapses , in the amygdala increased 7 days after fear conditioning .

19995593|The amygdalar complex is a limbic structure that plays a key role in emotional processing and fear conditioning .

19961124|A volume reduction and/or activity decrease of frontal brain structures associated with impulse control and the regulation of fear and anger are likewise found in combination with a fear-related hyperactivity of the amygdala .

19957279|The data indicate that the anxiety disorders share self-reported symptoms of anxiety and fear ; heightened anxiety and fear responding to cues that signal threat , cues that signal no threat , cues that formerly signaled threat , and contexts associated with threat ; elevated stress reactivity to aversive stimuli ; attentional biases to threat-relevant stimuli and threat-based appraisals of ambiguous stimuli ; and elevated amygdala responses to threat-relevant stimuli .

19955404|Regulation of amygdalar PKA by beta-arrestin-2 / phosphodiesterase-4 complex is critical for fear conditioning . .

19955404|Here we show that beta-arrestin-2 is critically involved in the formation of associative fear memory and amygdalar synaptic plasticity .

19955404|In response to fear conditioning , beta-arrestin-2 translocates to amygdalar membrane where it interacts with PDE-4 , a cAMP-degrading enzyme , to inhibit PKA activation .

19955404|Arrb2 -LRB- - / - -RRB- mice exhibit impaired conditioned fear memory and long-term potentiation at the lateral amygdalar synapses .

19955404|Moreover , expression of the beta-arrestin-2 in the lateral amygdala of Arrb2 -LRB- - / - -RRB- mice , but not its mutant form that is incapable of binding PDE-4 , restores basal PKA activity and rescues conditioned fear memory .

19955404|Taken together , our data demonstrate that the feedback regulation of amygdalar PKA activation by beta-arrestin-2 and PDE-4 complex is critical for the formation of conditioned fear memory .

19955360|Additional analysis suggested that impairment in fear recognition can result from damage to the IFOF and not the amygdala .

19945383|The amygdala is a chemosensor that detects carbon dioxide and acidosis to elicit fear behavior . .

19945383|The amygdala processes and directs inputs and outputs that are key to fear behavior .

19945383|Because the amygdala expresses acid-sensing ion channel-1a -LRB- ASIC1a -RRB- , and ASIC1a is required for normal fear responses , we hypothesized that the amygdala might detect a reduced pH. We found that inhaled CO -LRB- 2 -RRB- reduced brain pH and evoked fear behavior in mice .

19945383|Eliminating or inhibiting ASIC1a markedly impaired this activity , and localized ASIC1a expression in the amygdala rescued the CO -LRB- 2 -RRB- - induced fear deficit of ASIC1a null animals .

19945383|Buffering pH attenuated fear behavior , whereas directly reducing pH with amygdala microinjections reproduced the effect of CO -LRB- 2 -RRB- .

19945375|The amygdala is a brain region that coordinates fear responses to a variety of threats .

19945375|Ziemann et al. -LRB- 2009 -RRB- now show that acid-sensing channels in the amygdala mediate fear responses that accompany inhalation of carbon dioxide , suggesting that aberrant chemosensation may underlie anxiety disorders associated with a fear of suffocation .

19944771|The existing imaging literature on the neurobiological correlates of fear processing and anxiety disorders points to a pivotal role of the amygdala in the human fear circuit .

19933881|Nuclear disconnection within the amygdala reveals a direct pathway to fear . .

19933881|It is widely believed that a descending serial circuit consisting of neural projections from the basolateral complex -LRB- BLA -RRB- to the central nucleus -LRB- CEA -RRB- of the amygdala mediates fear expression .

19931400|Twenty-seven unmedicated patients with acutely-impairing current anxiety disorders and/or MDD and 31 healthy adolescents , matched on age , gender and IQ , rated their fear of fearful , angry , neutral and happy facial expressions during collection of fMRI data on the amygdala and hippocampus .

19917597|While rating subjective fear of neutral faces , youths with ADHD demonstrated left amygdala hyperactivity relative to the other three groups , whereas youths with severe mood dysregulation demonstrated hypoactivity .

19917592|Poor fear conditioning early in life implicates amygdala and ventral prefrontal cortex dysfunction and a lack of fear of socializing punishments in children who grow up to become criminals .

19914353|Amygdala dysfunction has been reported among patients with various psychiatric disorders , and dopamine is critical to the amygdala 's ability to mediate fear conditioning .

19914045|Both the amygdala and hippocampus are necessary for fear extinction occur , and thus both regions may be abnormal in PTSD .

19914045|Furthermore the apparent interplay between amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex represents support at the level of gross brain morphology for the theory of PTSD as a failure of fear extinction .

19912470|Identification of plasticity-associated genes regulated by Pavlovian fear conditioning in the lateral amygdala . .

19912470|Most recent studies aimed at defining the cellular and molecular mechanisms of Pavlovian fear conditioning have focused on protein kinase signaling pathways and the transcription factor cAMP-response element binding protein -LRB- CREB -RRB- that promote fear memory consolidation in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- .

19885620|The amygdala is known to play an important role in fear , rage and emotional memory .

19876409|The alpha1 subunit of the GABA -LRB- A -RRB- receptor modulates fear learning and plasticity in the lateral amygdala . .

19876409|Consistent with this observation , genetic deletion of this subunit selectively enhanced plasticity in the lateral amygdala and increased auditory fear conditioning .

19876409|Finally , infusion of a alpha1 receptor antagonist into the lateral amygdala selectively impaired auditory fear learning .

19876409|Together , these results suggest that inhibitory transmission mediated by alpha1-containing GABA -LRB- A -RRB- receptors plays a critical role in amygdala plasticity and fear learning .

19864295|Differential dynamics of amino acid release in the amygdala and olfactory cortex during odor fear acquisition as revealed with simultaneous high temporal resolution microdialysis . .

19864295|Although the amygdala seems to be essential to the formation and storage of fear memories , it might store only some aspects of the aversive event and facilitate the storage of more specific sensory aspects in cortical areas .

19864295|We addressed the time course of amygdala and cortical activation in the context of odor fear conditioning in rats .

19861403|We investigated whether the N-methyl-D-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- receptor partial agonist D-cycloserine -LRB- DCS , 20 microg/side -RRB- microinfused into the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- would reverse stress-induced impairment of extinction in two aversive learning paradigms : contextual fear conditioning and conditioned taste aversion -LRB- CTA -RRB- .

19853006|Role of dopamine receptor mechanisms in the amygdaloid modulation of fear and anxiety : Structural and functional analysis . .

19853006|Dopamine plays an important role in fear and anxiety modulating a cortical brake that the medial prefrontal cortex exerts on the anxiogenic output of the amygdala and have an important influence on the trafficking of impulses between the basolateral -LRB- BLA -RRB- and central nuclei -LRB- CeA -RRB- of amygdala .

19837165|The Ras effector Rin1 is induced concomitant with synaptogenesis in forebrain neurons , where it inhibits fear conditioning and amygdala LTP .

19837115|Therefore we set out to examine the effects of voluntary exercise on cued Pavlovian fear conditioning , a form of learning that is critically dependent on the amygdala .

19836379|This role for the ventral hippocampus in anxiety is distinct from the role of the amygdala in other aspects of emotional processing , such as fear conditioning .

19836371|Individuals with psychopathic tendencies may show a selective impairment in empathy with sadness and fear due to abnormalities in neural circuits connected with the amygdala .

19830836|The amygdala is known to have a crucial role in both the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear , but the physiological changes and biochemical mechanisms underlying these forms of learning are only partly understood .

19830836|The Ras effector Rin1 activates Abl tyrosine kinases and Rab5 GTPases and is highly expressed in mature neurons of the telencephalon including the amygdala , where it inhibits the acquisition of fear memories -LRB- Rin1 -LRB- - / - -RRB- mice show enhanced learning of conditioned fear -RRB- .

19830836|While demonstrating a correlation between amygdala plasticity and fear learning , our findings argue against models proposing a direct causative relationship between amygdala depotentiation and fear extinction .

19828596|Past studies have shown that amygdala damage can impair recognition of facial expressions , particularly fear , as well as processing of gaze direction ; but the mechanisms responsible for these deficits remain debated .

19828596|Here we investigated facial emotion recognition and its interaction with gaze in patients with unilateral amygdala damage -LRB- n = 19 -RRB- , compared to healthy controls -LRB- n = 10 -RRB- , using computer-generated dynamic face stimuli expressing variable intensities of fear , anger or joy , with different gaze directions -LRB- direct versus averted -RRB- .

19811531|AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic modifications in the amygdala have been reported to sustain cued fear conditioning .

19794190|The amygdala is not necessary for unconditioned stimulus inflation after Pavlovian fear conditioning in rats . .

19794190|It is not known whether the amygdala performs such a function in aversive paradigms , such as Pavlovian fear conditioning in rats .

19794190|In Experiment 3 , NBQX infusions into the BLA impaired the acquisition of auditory fear conditioning with an inflation-magnitude US , indicating that the amygdala is required for associative learning with intense USs .

19794190|Together , these results suggest that the amygdala is not required for revaluing an aversive US despite being required for the acquisition of fear to that US .

19788551|Abnormal amygdala functioning , as indirectly assessed by fear conditioning , may be one of the factors influencing the development of childhood aggression .

19786358|Effects of intra-basolateral amygdala administration of rimonabant on nociceptive behaviour and neuronal activity in the presence or absence of contextual fear . .

19786076|Previous behavioral studies have shown that neuropeptides intrinsic to the amygdala formation can alter fear and anxiety states .

19783993|Our findings demonstrate that CREB modulates the allocation of fear memory to specific cells in lateral amygdala and suggest that neuronal excitability is important in this process .

19775504|Alterations of excitatory transmission in the lateral amygdala during expression and extinction of fear memory . .

19775504|Here we report that fear conditioning resulted in an increase in AMPA/NMDA ratio as well as depression of paired-pulse facilitation -LRB- PPF -RRB- in neurons of the lateral nucleus of amygdala .

19766728|Contextual , but not auditory , fear conditioning is disrupted by neurotoxic selective lesion of the basal nucleus of amygdala in rats . .

19766728|The basolateral amygdala complex -LRB- BLA -RRB- is involved in acquisition of contextual and auditory fear conditioning .

19750195|Fear conditioning and its neural correlates were then assessed after the sensitive period at postnatal day -LRB- PN -RRB- 13 or in adulthood , ages when amygdala-dependent fear occurs .

19750195|This PN13 fear learning inhibition was also associated with suppression of shock-induced corticosterone , although the age appropriate amygdala-dependent fear learning was reinstated with systemic corticosterone -LRB- 3 mg/kg -RRB- during conditioning .

19750195|On the other hand , sensitive period odor-shock conditioning did not prevent adult fear conditioning , although freezing , amygdala and hippocampal 2-DG uptake and corticosterone levels were attenuated compared to adult conditioning without infant conditioning .

19750195|However , developmental differences between infants and adults are expressed with PN13 infants ' learning consistent with the original learned preference , while adult conditioning overrides the original learned preference with attenuated amygdala-dependent fear learning .

19748076|The objective herein is to determine whether extinction of fear responses is impaired in PTSD and whether such impairment is related to dysfunctional activation of brain regions known to be involved in fear extinction , viz. , amygdala , hippocampus , ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- , and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- dACC -RRB- .

19741115|Selective viral-mediated restoration of DA synthesis within the ventral tegmental area fully restored fear learning in DD mice , and restoration of DA synthesis to DA neurons projecting to the basolateral amygdala restored short-term memory but not long-term memory or shock sensitization .

19736355|Despite the repeated findings of impaired fear conditioning and affective recognition in psychopathic individuals , there has been a paucity of brain imaging research on the amygdala and no evidence suggesting which regions within the amygdala may be structurally compromised in individuals with psychopathy .

19735699|Bilateral phosphorylation of ERK in the lateral and centrolateral amygdala during unilateral storage of fear memories . .

19735699|We previously showed that when rats were trained to fear an auditory conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- by pairing it with a mild unilateral shock to the eyelid -LRB- the unconditioned stimulus , or US -RRB- , conditioned freezing depended upon the amygdala contralateral but not ipsilateral from the US .

19735699|Conditioned freezing was impaired 24 h after training when U0126 was infused contralaterally-but not ipsilaterally-from the US , suggesting that fear memories were consolidated mainly by the contralateral amygdala .

19735699|Thus , fear acquisition induced ERK phosphorylation bilaterally in the amygdala , even though the ipsilateral hemisphere did not appear to participate in conditioned freezing .

19735699|Hence , asymmetric induction of plasticity in CeL might help to explain why conditioned freezing depends preferentially upon the amygdala contralateral from the US in our fear conditioning paradigm .

19731317|Activation of neuropeptide Y -LRB- NPY -RRB- Y1 receptors -LRB- Y1r -RRB- in the rat basolateral nuclear complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- produces anxiolysis and interferes with the generation of conditioned fear .

19729347|Alterations in extracellular levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid in the rat basolateral amygdala and periaqueductal gray during conditioned fear , persistent pain and fear-conditioned analgesia . .

19729347|Using dual probe microdialysis coupled to HPLC , we investigated alterations in extracellular levels of GABA simultaneously in the rat basolateral amygdala and dorsal periaqueductal gray during expression of conditioned fear , formalin-evoked nociception , and fear-conditioned analgesia .

19729347|In conclusion , expression of contextually induced fear - and pain-related behavior are accompanied by suppression of GABA release in the basolateral amygdala and dorsal periaqueductal gray , respectively , compared with non-fear , non-pain controls .

19726637|This result indicates that the mere conditioning experience , the exposure to the CS , or the expression of CS-elicited fear in and of itself is not sufficient to explain the observed increase in pMAPK-IR neurons in the mPFC and/or the amygdala after extinction .

19718036|We found that an individual with complete bilateral amygdala lesions , who can not recognize fear from faces , nonetheless showed normal rapid detection and nonconscious processing of those same fearful faces .

19718036|We conclude that the amygdala is not essential for early stages of fear processing but , instead , modulates recognition and social judgment .

19699473|Auditory fear conditioning , a form of amygdala-dependent emotional learning , occurs differently in juvenile and adult rodents .

19699473|Changes in thalamic but not cortical inputs to amygdala take place during late development and might contribute to differences in auditory fear conditioning between juveniles and adults .

19696688|Using event-related functional MRI -LRB- fMRI -RRB- , we showed increased amygdalar responses to various emotions -LRB- anger , fear , happiness , eroticism -RRB- expressed by prosody , a means of communication bound to language and consequently unique to humans .

19696688|The smallest signal increases were found for fearful prosody , a finding that could not be explained by rapid response habituation to stimuli of this emotional category , challenging classical theories about fear specificity of the human amygdala .

19693004|Phasic vs sustained fear in rats and humans : role of the extended amygdala in fear vs anxiety . .

19693004|Rodent studies suggest that phasic fear is mediated by the amygdala , which sends outputs to the hypothalamus and brainstem to produce symptoms of fear .

19693004|Sustained fear is also mediated by the amygdala , which releases corticotropin-releasing factor , a stress hormone that acts on receptors in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- , a part of the so-called ` extended amygdala . '

19693004|The amygdala and BNST send outputs to the same hypothalamic and brainstem targets to produce phasic and sustained fear , respectively .

19692610|Overall , this suggests that inter-individual variations in fear generalization and anxiety phenotype are determined by BNST influences on the amygdala and/or its targets .

19689454|The lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- has been implicated in the formation of long-term associative memory -LRB- LTM -RRB- of stimuli associated with danger through fear conditioning .

19686780|The amygdala was studied because it modulates fear and its function is affected by stress .

19683026|The short allele of a functional polymorphism -LRB- 5-HTTLPR -RRB- in the serotonin transporter -LRB- 5-HTT -RRB- promoter is associated with reduced serotonin transporter expression , lower in vivo 5-HTT binding , higher neuroticism and amygdala reactivity as well as facilitated fear conditioning and is a candidate variant for panic disorder .

19675247|TrkB modulates fear learning and amygdalar synaptic plasticity by specific docking sites . .

19675247|To identify the molecular pathways required for fear learning and amygdalar synaptic plasticity downstream of TrkB , we used highly defined genetic mouse models carrying single point mutations at one of these two sites -LRB- Y515F or Y816F -RRB- to examine the physiological relevance of pathways activated through these sites for pavlovian fear conditioning -LRB- FC -RRB- , as well as for synaptic plasticity as measured by field recordings obtained from neurons of different amygdala nuclei .

19675247|Thus , TrkB receptors modulate specific phases of fear learning and amygdalar synaptic plasticity through two main phosphorylation docking sites .

19669160|Dopamine , acting at the D1 family receptors -LRB- D1R -RRB- is critical for the functioning of the amygdala , including fear conditioning and cue-induced reinstatement of drug self administration .

19669009|The fear network , composed of the hippocampus , the medial prefrontal cortex , the amygdala and its brain stem projections , might be oversensitive in PD patients .

19664757|Intraneuronal beta-amyloid accumulation in the amygdala enhances fear and anxiety in Alzheimer 's disease transgenic mice . .

19664757|The APP -LRB- Ind -RRB- / APP -LRB- Sw , Ind -RRB- and 3xTg-AD transgenic mice displayed at early ages enhanced innate and conditioned fear symptoms and spatial memory deficits coinciding with enhanced accumulation of Abeta in gamma-aminobutyric acid -LRB- GABA -RRB- ergic and glutamatergic neurons , respectively , of the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

19664757|In addition , phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase -LRB- ERK -RRB- 1/2 , which is critical for acquisition and consolidation of fear conditioning , was increased in the amygdala of APP transgenic mice after cued conditioning .

19657022|Cornering the fear engram : long-term synaptic changes in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala after fear conditioning . .

19657022|Use-dependent synaptic modifications in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- have been suggested to be the cellular analog of memory trace after pavlovian fear conditioning .

19653893|Bilateral amygdala activation was obtained to all emotional expressions -LRB- anger , disgust , fear , happy , and sad -RRB- and neutral faces across all subjects .

19653893|However , only in males a significant correlation of amygdala activation and behavioral response to fearful stimuli was observed , indicating higher amygdala responses with better fear recognition , thus pointing to subtle gender differences .

19646971|Extracellular serotonin level in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala and dorsal periaqueductal gray under unconditioned and conditioned fear states : an in vivo microdialysis study . .

19634944|Protein kinase Mzeta maintains fear memory in the amygdala but not in the hippocampus . .

19634944|This study examined the role of PKMzeta in amygdala and hippocampal neurons following a standard fear conditioning protocol .

19634944|The results indicate that PKMzeta inhibition in the amygdala , but not in the hippocampus , can disrupt fear memory .

19633138|Reciprocal patterns of c-Fos expression in the medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala after extinction and renewal of conditioned fear . .

19632347|Auditory fear conditioning requires anatomical projections from the medial geniculate nucleus -LRB- MGN -RRB- of the thalamus to the amygdala .

19619587|Increased c-fos expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala and enhancement of cued fear memory in Dyt1 DeltaGAG knock-in mice . .

19617910|Impaired amygdala plasticity was associated with reduced cued and contextual fear conditioning .

19609506|Neuropeptide Y -LRB- NPY -RRB- and its receptors are densely localized in brain regions involved in the mediation and modulation of fear , including the amygdala .

19609506|These data show an important role of the transmitter NPY within the amygdala for the expression of conditioned fear .

19595780|Given that this form of Pavlovian fear conditioning is critically dependent on the basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , we were interested in the mechanisms by which Ca -LRB- V -RRB- 1.3 contributes to BLA neurophysiology .

19582153|Functional imaging of stimulus convergence in amygdalar neurons during Pavlovian fear conditioning . .

19582153|Our results also support the view that contextual fear memories are encoded in the amygdala and that the role of dorsal hippocampus is to process and transmit contextual CS information .

19580851|In fear as induced by FPS , the central amygdaloid nucleus and the dorsolateral part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis loaded on the same component , but Fos-IR observed in these brain regions did not differentiate between anxiety and fear .

19571138|During auditory fear conditioning , it is well established that lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- neurons potentiate their response to the tone conditioned stimulus , and that this potentiation is required for conditioned fear behavior .

19571138|Together with previous inactivation findings , the present results suggest that PL transforms transient amygdala inputs to a sustained output that drives conditioned fear responses and gates the expression of extinction .

19571138|Given the relatively long latency of conditioned responses we observed in PL -LRB- approximately 100 ms after tone onset -RRB- , we propose that PL integrates inputs from the amygdala , hippocampus , and other cortical sources to regulate the expression of fear memories .

19567836|Persistence of fear memory across time requires the basolateral amygdala complex . .

19567836|The basolateral amygdala complex -LRB- BLA -RRB- is considered an essential component of this conditional fear learning system .

19567836|However , recent studies challenge this view and suggest that plasticity within other brain regions -LRB- i.e. , central nucleus of the amygdala -RRB- may be crucial for fear conditioning .

19560549|Extinction of learned fear is both amygdala - and NMDA receptor -LRB- NMDAr -RRB- - dependent .

19555645|Previous studies have clearly identified the amygdala as a key brain structure for acquisition and storage of fear memory traces .

19555645|Here , we review current understanding and emerging concepts of how local inhibitory circuits in the amygdala control the acquisition , expression , and extinction of conditioned fear at different levels .

19553867|Studies indicate that there are developmental changes in amygdala activation , including limbic hyperactivity to fear faces during adolescence , a critical time for the onset of schizophrenia .

19553379|We show that activating these receptors prior to fear conditioning by infusing the group 1 mGluR agonist , -LRB- R.S. -RRB- -3,5 - dihydroxyphenylglycine -LRB- DHPG -RRB- , into the basolateral region of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- of adult Sprague-Dawley rats enhances freezing normally supported by a weak footshock .

19553379|These results support previous findings by Rodrigues and colleagues that mGluR5s in the lateral region of the amygdala make an import contribution to fear conditioning .

19526456|We hypothesized that in humans the gene coding for stathmin -LRB- STMN1 -RRB- , which is highly expressed in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala and associated thalamic and cortical structures , influences behavioral responses to fear and anxiety stimuli by way of two common single nucleotide polymorphisms -LRB- rs182455 , SNP1 ; rs213641 , SNP2 -RRB- .

19526456|We used the acoustic startle paradigm and a standardized laboratory protocol for the induction of fear and psychosocial stress in 106 healthy volunteers to investigate the impact of stathmin gene variation on two fear - and anxiety-controlling effector-systems of the amygdala .

19523478|In synaptic circuits within the amygdala , which are important for processing of acute fear as well as formation and expression of fear memories , NPS causes increased release of the excitatory transmitter glutamate , especially in synaptic contacts to a subset of GABAergic interneurons .

19494159|The central nucleus of the amygdala and corticotropin-releasing factor : insights into contextual fear memory . .

19494159|The central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- has been traditionally viewed in fear conditioning to serve as an output neural center that transfers conditioned information formed in the basolateral amygdala to brain structures that generate emotional responses .

19493626|Here we examined whether amygdala reactivity to threat-related facial expressions -LRB- fear , anger -RRB- differs as a function of AR CAG length variation and endogenous -LRB- salivary -RRB- testosterone in a mid-life sample of 41 healthy men -LRB- mean age = 45.6 years , range : 34-54 years ; CAG repeats , range : 19-29 -RRB- .

19482263|Block of gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptor insertion in the amygdala impairs extinction of conditioned fear . .

19482263|GABA -LRB- A -RRB- receptor insertion in the amygdala contributes a significant part to the extinction of fear memory .

19482067|Previous research in our laboratory has shown that damage to the amygdala in neonatal rhesus monkeys profoundly alters behaviors associated with fear processing , while leaving many aspects of social development intact .

19480989|Subdivisions of the arcopallium/posterior pallial amygdala complex are differentially involved in the control of fear behaviour in the Japanese quail . .

19480989|Growing evidence suggests that the arcopallium/posterior pallial amygdala plays a major role in the control of fear behaviour in birds .

19480989|The aim of the present study was to investigate the relative involvement of two subdivisions of the arcopallium/posterior pallial amygdala complex in four classical tests of fear in quail : the presentation of a novel object , the ` hole-in-the-wall ' , ` open-field ' and tonic immobility tests .

19480989|Bilateral electrolytic lesions damaging the posterior part of the arcopallium/posterior pallial amygdala resulted in an increase in fear behaviour in the ` open-field ' test , whereas quail with lesions damaging the anterior part of the arcopallium displayed a decrease in an ` overall fear score ' , compared to quail with bilateral nidopallium or sham lesions .

19480989|The differential involvement of the anterior and posterior parts of the arcopallium/posterior pallial amygdala in fear behaviour is discussed in view of the known connections between the arcopallium/posterior pallial amygdala complex and brain regions considered to be limbic in nature .

19477189|The effect of CRF and alpha-helical CRF -LRB- -LRB- 9-41 -RRB- -RRB- on rat fear responses and amino acids release in the central nucleus of the amygdala . .

19477189|The effects of intracerebroventricular injections of CRF and a non-selective CRF receptor antagonist , alpha-helical CRF -LRB- -LRB- 9-41 -RRB- -RRB- , on the release of glutamate , aspartate , and GABA in the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , were examined in the course of testing rat anxiety-like behaviour in the conditioned fear test -LRB- a freezing response -RRB- , using the microdialysis technique .

19477189|In sum , these are new findings , which show an important role of CRF in the CeA in the regulation of fear-controlled amino acids release and suggest an involvement of amino acids in the central nucleus of the amygdala in the effects of this neurohormone on the expression of conditioned fear .

19477171|Aripiprazole and haloperidol suppress excessive dopamine release in the amygdala in response to conditioned fear stress , but show contrasting effects on basal dopamine release in methamphetamine-sensitized rats . .

19477171|In conclusion , the effect of an antipsychotic drug is likely to be involved in attenuation of the phasic increase in dopamine associated with the fear response , at least in the amygdala .

19470650|A discrete population of neurons in the lateral amygdala is specifically activated by contextual fear conditioning . .

19470650|There is no clear identification of the neurons involved in fear conditioning in the amygdala .

19470650|The highly specific localization of these neurons within the lateral amygdala suggests that these neurons may be a discrete population of neurons involved in fear learning .

19449368|In APP/PS1 transgenic mice , a model of AD in which amyloid beta -LRB- Abeta -RRB- accumulates in the brain , we have examined neurons in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- , a brain region crucial to establish cued fear conditioning .

19446647|Regions of heightened activation included brainstem and bilateral amygdala , anterior cingulate and ventral and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- for conscious fear , and brainstem and right-sided amygdala , anterior cingulate and ventral , mPFC for nonconscious fear .

19439581|Differential involvement of ASIC1a in the basolateral amygdala in fear memory and unconditioned fear responses . .

19428424|This hypothesis was based on previous evidence suggesting amygdalar abnormalities in PD patients , coupled with the known role of the amygdala in fear processing .

19428413|We measured brain activity using fMRI during perception of fearful or neutral actions and showed that whereas similar activation of brain regions known to play a role in action perception was revealed in both autistics and controls , autistics failed to activate amygdala , inferior frontal gyrus and premotor cortex when viewing gestures expressing fear .

19411609|Augmentation of fear extinction by infusion of glycine transporter blockers into the amygdala . .

19410584|The aim of the current lesion study was to examine whether the amygdala is also critically involved in differential SCR during a more explicit form of fear learning .

19397934|Our results suggest that the auditory conditioned stimulus can be processed in part independently of the IC and MG in the stressed animals , and sent to the amygdala via the PO inducing unconditioned fear .

19381996|The effect of unilateral amygdala removals on detecting fear from briefly presented backward-masked faces . .

19381996|The aim of the current study was to investigate whether patients with amygdala lesions would also be impaired at detecting fear from briefly presented , backward-masked faces .

19381996|Intriguingly , patients with amygdala damage found it more difficult to recognize fear from faces shown for unlimited durations than to detect fear from briefly presented faces .

19380710|For conditioned fear , the dorsal-ventral dichotomy is accomplished via divergent projections to different subregions of the amygdala , whereas for drug seeking , it is accomplished via divergent projections to the subregions of the nucleus accumbens .

19373980|We sought to determine the colocalisation of c-Fos -LRB- a marker of neuronal activation -RRB- and glucocorticoid receptors -LRB- GRs -RRB- as well as of 5-HT -LRB- 1A -RRB- and glucocorticoid receptor immunoreactivity-expressing cells -LRB- ir -RRB- in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- M2 -RRB- , dentate gyrus of the hippocampus -LRB- DG -RRB- , and basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- in low and high anxiety rats -LRB- i.e. , rats with duration of a freezing response in the conditioned fear test one standard error or more below or above the mean value : low responders -LRB- LR -RRB- and high responders -LRB- HR -RRB- , respectively -RRB- .

19371787|As compared with neutral actions , the perception of fear and anger behaviors elicited comparable activity increases in the left amygdala and temporal cortices as well as in the ventrolateral and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex .

19359671|A convergent body of human and nonhuman studies suggests that the amygdala mediates the acquisition and expression of conditioned fear and the enhancement of emotional memory , whereas the vmPFC mediates the extinction of conditioned fear and the volitional regulation of negative emotion .

19323992|Nipping fear in the bud : inhibitory control in the amygdala . .

19323992|Cortical and thalamic inputs to the lateral amygdala are recruited during auditory fear conditioning .

19321315|Disentangling the web of fear : amygdala reactivity and functional connectivity in spider and snake phobia . .

19292996|In the adult male offspring of Long-Evans dams characterised as high or low in maternal care -LRB- high LG and low LG -RRB- we -LRB- 1 -RRB- examined basal dendritic morphology in the dentate gyrus by Golgi staining ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- investigated rapid modulation of in vitro long term-potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- in the dentate gyrus by glucocorticoid and beta-adrenergic stimulation ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- examined hippocampal and amygdala-dependent learning under stress using contextual and cued fear conditioning .

19292996|This was mirrored in hippocampal but not amygdala-dependent learning , as low LG offspring showed enhanced contextual but not cued fear conditioning .

19287318|Testosterone fails to change cued fear responses although it induces excessive contextual fear associated with corticolimbic 5alpha-reductase-type-I mRNA expression downregulation in the prefrontal cortex , hippocampus , and basolateral amygdala glutamatergic neurons .

19286560|We have shown previously that lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- neurons with increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein -LRB- CREB -RRB- are preferentially activated by fear memory expression , which suggests that they are selectively recruited into the memory trace .

19285474|RMTg lesions markedly reduce passive fear behaviors -LRB- freezing , open-arm avoidance -RRB- dependent on the extended amygdala , periaqueductal gray , or septum , all regions that project directly to the RMTg .

19273493|Given that randomized controlled trials are now investigating a few doses of + / -3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine -LRB- MDMA , ` ecstasy ' -RRB- in combination with psychotherapy for treatment-resistant anxiety disorders , we would like to suggest the following three mechanisms for this potentially important new approach : 1 -RRB- MDMA increases oxytocin levels , which may strengthen the therapeutic alliance ; 2 -RRB- MDMA increases ventromedial prefrontal activity and decreases amygdala activity , which may improve emotional regulation and decrease avoidance and 3 -RRB- MDMA increases norepinephrine release and circulating cortisol levels , which may facilitate emotional engagement and enhance extinction of learned fear associations .

19272304|In rats and primates , the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeN -RRB- is most known for its role in responses to fear stimuli .

19255912|Our results show that , first , the amygdala and the fusiform gyrus are sensitive to recognition of facial and bodily fear signals .

19255377|However , both MDD and anxiety groups , relative to healthy participants , exhibited similar signs of amygdala hyperactivation to fearful faces when subjectively experienced fear was rated .

19247210|We have recently characterized a form of ex vivo depotentiation -LRB- depotentiationex vivo -RRB- , which correlates tightly with fear extinction , at thalamic input synapses onto the lateral amygdala .

19247210|Here , we examined the effects of learning-attenuating drugs , reported to impair fear extinction when microinjected into the basolateral amygdala , on depotentiationex vivo .

19247210|These findings indicate that amygdala depotentiation shares some molecular processes with learning and further suggest that different forms of synaptic plasticity in the basolateral amygdala mediate fear extinction .

19246474|Noradrenergic enhancement of amygdala responses to fear . .

19246474|Multiple lines of evidence implicate the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and the noradrenergic -LRB- norepinephrine , NE -RRB- system in responding to stressful stimuli such as fear signals , suggesting hyperfunction of both in the development of stress-related pathologies including anxiety disorders .

19246474|We found that reboxetine induced an amygdala response bias towards fear signals that did not exist at placebo baseline .

19237641|Enhanced CREB-dependent gene expression increases the excitability of neurons in the basal amygdala and primes the consolidation of contextual and cued fear memory . .

19225430|Frontolimbic structures involved in fear conditioning have also been associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal -LRB- HPA -RRB- - axis modulation , including amygdaloid , hippocampal , and ventromedial prefrontal cortex regions .

19220486|Variation in the BDNF genotype appears related to abnormal fear conditioning , consistent with nonhuman animal work on the importance of BDNF in amygdala-dependent associative learning .

19175757|Neural findings suggest that the amygdala is the core structure for fear acquisition , whereas prefrontal cortical areas are given pivotal roles in fear extinction .

19166914|Here we tested a hypothesis that epileptogenesis influences expression pattern of genes in the basolateral amygdala that are critical for fear conditioning .

19166914|Whole genome molecular profiling of basolateral rat amygdala was performed to compare the transcriptome changes underlying fear learning in epileptogenic and control animals .

19166914|Our analysis revealed that after fear conditioning procedure 26 genes were regulated differently in the basolateral amygdala of both groups .

19144840|Finally , we showed that blocking protein synthesis in either the hippocampus or the amygdala blocked reconsolidation of contextual fear memory , whereas similar blockade in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex prevented the formation of extinction memory .

19141468|Infusion of the NMDA receptor antagonist , DL-APV , into the basolateral amygdala disrupts learning to fear a novel and a familiar context as well as relearning to fear an extinguished context . .

19141468|Ample evidence suggests that activation of NMDA receptors -LRB- NMDAr -RRB- in the basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is necessary for context fear conditioning .

19141466|In Experiment 4 , inhibition was spared when midazolam was injected into the basolateral amygdala before the second extinction , but impaired when injected before the first extinction of context-conditioned fear .

19132103|Cumulative evidence suggests that the amygdala plays a central role in the acquisition , storage and expression of fear memory .

19117915|Hippocampal and extrahippocampal systems compete for control of contextual fear : role of ventral subiculum and amygdala . .

19117915|Our experiments also reveal that the basolateral region of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is where the two systems compete for associative control of the fear system .

19117910|Complementary roles for amygdala and periaqueductal gray in temporal-difference fear learning . .

19117910|These experiments used a serial compound conditioning design to determine the roles of basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- NMDA receptors and ventrolateral midbrain periaqueductal gray -LRB- vlPAG -RRB- mu-opioid receptors -LRB- MOR -RRB- in predictive fear learning .

19117910|These findings identify complementary but dissociable roles for amygdala NMDA receptors and vlPAG MOR in temporal-difference predictive fear learning .

19109502|Signaling through cGMP-dependent protein kinase I in the amygdala is critical for auditory-cued fear memory and long-term potentiation . .

19109502|Long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- of inputs relaying sensory information from cortical and thalamic neurons to principal neurons in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is thought to serve as a cellular mechanism for associative fear learning .

19108606|We then examined , using ZIP , the effect of PKMzeta inhibition in dorsal hippocampus -LRB- DH -RRB- and basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- on retention of 1-d-old information acquired in the radial arm maze , water maze , inhibitory avoidance , and contextual and cued fear conditioning paradigms .

19104668|Synaptic changes at sensory inputs to the dorsal nucleus of the lateral amygdala -LRB- LAd -RRB- play a key role in the acquisition and storage of associative fear memory .

19100329|In contrast , conditional fear and differential amygdala activity developed on both perceived and unperceived trials , regardless of whether contingency awareness was expressed .

19091964|Restoring Acid-sensing ion channel-1a in the amygdala of knock-out mice rescues fear memory but not unconditioned fear responses . .

19091964|These data pinpoint the basolateral amygdala as the site where ASIC1a contributes to fear memory .

19089345|The canonical NO/sGC/cGMP / cGK pathway modulates long-term changes of synaptic activity in the hippocampus , amygdala , cerebellum , and other brain regions , and contributes to distinct forms of learning and memory , such as fear conditioning , motor adaptation , and object recognition .

19073269|These findings show that chronic stress and sex interact to influence fear conditioning , with chronic stress impairing the recall of delayed fear extinction in males to implicate the medial prefrontal cortex , disrupting the recall of the fear conditioning acquisition in females to implicate the amygdala , and nonstressed controls exhibiting sex differences in fear conditioning and extinction , which may involve the amygdala and/or corticosterone levels .

19056466|The goal of the present experiment was to study the performance of inbred Roman high - -LRB- RHA-I -RRB- and low - -LRB- RLA-I -RRB- avoidance rats in one-way avoidance learning and to relate the behaviour of the animals to cellular density in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , a brain region related to fear and anxiety .

19052925|A role for ERKs has been proposed in the adult brain in mediating neuronal functions , as for fear learning in the lateral amygdala .

19045948|Associative structure of fear memory after basolateral amygdala lesions in rats . .

19045948|The authors have recently demonstrated that rats with basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- lesions acquire Pavlovian fear conditioning after overtraining .

19045948|Indeed , the central nucleus of the amygdala , which is essential for fear conditioning in rats with BLA lesions , may mediate S-R associations in some Pavlovian tasks .

19045948|These results reveal that S-S associations support Pavlovian fear memories after overtraining in both intact rats and rats with BLA lesions , and imply that the central nucleus of the amygdala encodes CS-US associations during fear conditioning .

19036872|A biologically realistic network model of acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear associations in lateral amygdala neurons . .

19036872|The basolateral amygdala plays an important role in the acquisition and expression of both fear conditioning and fear extinction .

19036872|To understand how a single structure could encode these '' opposite '' memories , we developed a biophysical network model of the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- neurons during auditory fear conditioning and extinction .

19025931|Corticolimbic structures including basolateral amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex are critical for acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear , and such learning is N-methyl-D-aspartic acid -LRB- NMDA -RRB- receptor-dependent .

19020031|The activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein -LRB- Arc/Arg3 .1 -RRB- is required for memory consolidation of pavlovian fear conditioning in the lateral amygdala . .

19020031|Here , we examined the role of Arc/Arg3 .1 in amygdala-dependent Pavlovian fear conditioning .

19020031|We first examined the regulation of Arc/Arg3 .1 mRNA and protein after fear conditioning and LTP-inducing stimulation of thalamic inputs to the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- .

19020031|These findings suggest that Arc/Arg3 .1 expression in the amygdala is required for fear memory consolidation , and further suggest that Arc/Arg3 .1 regulation in the LA is downstream of the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway .

19015094|The left amygdala knows fear : laterality in the amygdala response to fearful eyes . .

19015094|It is unknown how the amygdala differentiates between these increases in EWA and those that are specifically associated with fear .

19000716|These results indicate that -LRB- 1 -RRB- the BNST , unlike the amygdala , does not appear to be critically involved in the consolidation process related to the memory of social defeat and -LRB- 2 -RRB- the BNST may be an important site for the execution of fear behaviors associated with social defeat .

19000716|Considering the high degree of connectivity between the BNST and the amygdala , these findings provide further insight into the neural circuitry governing conditioned defeat and support the view of a functional dissociation between the amygdala and the BNST in the modulation of conditioned fear in an ethologically relevant model .

18996489|Given the inherent differences between anger and fear , we hypothesised that anxiety would modulate the amygdala response to angry faces to a greater extent when attended .

18996489|By contrast , increased anxiety was associated with a greater left amygdala response to fearful faces -LRB- versus neutral or angry faces -RRB- in the unattended condition , with only borderline evidence for attended fear -LRB- relative to neutral -RRB- .

18985128|The amygdala has been considered to be essential for recognizing fear in other people 's facial expressions .

18985128|Here we used movies of facial expressions instead of static photographs to investigate the putative fear selectivity of the amygdala using fMRI under more ecological conditions .

18985115|These findings confirm the central role of the amygdala in the acquisition and expression of observational fear learning , and validate the extension of cross-species models of fear conditioning to learning in a human sociocultural context .

18982530|Greater effective connectivity from left MOFC to amygdala differentiated positive and neutral expressions from negatively valenced angry , disgust , and fear expressions .

18982530|Greater effective connectivity from right LOFC to amygdala differentiated emotion expressions conducive to perceiver approach -LRB- happy , neutral , and fear -RRB- from angry expressions that elicit perceiver withdrawal .

18976695|Generally more activity was observed in the fear network -LRB- e.g. the amygdala , the lateral orbitofrontal cortex -RRB- in aware participants and in the nucleus accumbens -LRB- NAcc -RRB- .

18973583|Pavlovian fear conditioning as a behavioral assay for hippocampus and amygdala function : cautions and caveats . .

18973583|The hippocampus and amygdala are widely believed to be essential for fear conditioning to contexts and discrete cues , respectively .

18973583|Indeed , this parsing of function within the fear circuit has been used to leverage fear conditioning as a behavioral assay of hippocampal and amygdala function , particularly in transgenic mouse models .

18973583|Recent work , however , blurs the anatomical segregation of cue and context conditioning and challenges the necessity for the hippocampus and amygdala in fear learning .

18973583|Caution must therefore be exercised when using fear conditioning as a behavioral assay for hippocampal - and amygdala-dependent learning .

18971295|The amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- are thought to subserve distinct functions , with the former mediating rapid fear responses to discrete sensory cues and the latter longer '' anxiety-like '' states in response to diffuse environmental contingencies .

18958186|AMPA GluR1 glutamate receptor knockout mice -LRB- KO -RRB- exhibit abnormal hippocampal and amygdala plasticity , and deficits on various assays for cognition including Pavlovian fear conditioning .

18950748|A significant three-way genotype-by-diagnosis-by-face-emotion interaction characterized right amygdala activity while subjects monitored internal fear levels .

18839210|Dopaminergic -LRB- DA -RRB- inputs to the basolateral nuclear complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLC -RRB- are critical for several important functions , including reward-related learning , drug-stimulus learning , and fear conditioning .

18832566|The NO-cGMP-PKG signaling pathway regulates synaptic plasticity and fear memory consolidation in the lateral amygdala via activation of ERK/MAP kinase . .

18832566|Recent studies have shown that nitric oxide -LRB- NO -RRB- signaling plays a crucial role in memory consolidation of Pavlovian fear conditioning and in synaptic plasticity in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- .

18832561|De novo mRNA synthesis is required for both consolidation and reconsolidation of fear memories in the amygdala . .

18832561|Consolidation of new fear memories has been shown to require de novo RNA and protein synthesis in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- .

18823878|The results suggest that while the nonhuman primate amygdala is essential for the initial acquisition of fear conditioning , it does not appear to be necessary for the memory and expression of conditioned fear .

18823878|These findings are discussed in relation to a network of connections between the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex that may subserve different component processes of fear conditioning .

18820693|However , amygdala-specific deletion of Ctnnb1 prevented the normal transfer of newly formed fear learning into long-term memory .

18820693|Thus , beta-catenin may be required in the amygdala for the normal consolidation , but not acquisition , of fear memory .

18815362|NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- of glutamatergic synaptic transmission in sensory pathways from auditory thalamus or cortex to the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- underlies the acquisition of auditory fear conditioning .

18812413|Hyper-activation of the amygdala , a brain region involved in fear , to facial stimuli may be an important underlying neural abnormality .

18812227|Actin polymerization in lateral amygdala is essential for fear memory formation . .

18812227|In this study , we examined the role of actin polymerization in lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- in fear conditioning memory formation .

18809390|In combination with previous research on these strains , the present data tentatively suggest that Fast and Slow animals utilize different neural systems in tests of fear and anxiety which may have been co-selected with the direct selection of amygdala-kindling susceptibility .

18794533|Because these behaviors require threat assessment of the environment , it is plausible that they are regulated by the amygdala-associated neural circuitry of fear .

18794533|The basolateral complex of the amygdala nuclei -LRB- BLA -RRB- is particularly interesting in this regard : although the BLA role in forming memories for learned fear is established , the BLA role in innate behaviors is not well understood .

18790060|Since activity in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- seems crucial for fear expression of behavior , we studied the mechanisms of NPY in LA projection neurons using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in slices of the rat amygdala in vitro .

18786365|Our results suggest that the lateral PFC regions engaged by cognitive emotion regulation strategies may influence the amygdala , diminishing fear through similar vmPFC connections that are thought to inhibit the amygdala during extinction .

18775476|The amygdala is classically regarded as a detector of potential threat and as a critical component of the neural circuitry mediating conditioned fear responses .

18775445|Sleep deprivation impairs contextual but not cued learned fear , and it has been suggested that this pattern reflects an insensitivity of the amygdala to sleep loss .

18772253|Distinct contributions of the basolateral amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex to learning and relearning extinction of context conditioned fear . .

18772253|We studied the roles of the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- in learning and relearning to inhibit context conditioned fear -LRB- freezing -RRB- in extinction .

18772252|We recently showed that neonatal odor-shock learning attenuates later life odor fear conditioning and amygdala activity .

18768697|Dissociable roles for the hippocampus and the amygdala in human cued versus context fear conditioning . .

18751523|Ibotenic acid-induced lesions of the amygdala prevented the acquisition of fear-potentiated startle but , remarkably , did not prevent the expression of fear-potentiated startle when fear conditioning was carried out prior to the lesion .

18726527|Infusion of methylphenidate into the basolateral nucleus of amygdala or anterior cingulate cortex enhances fear memory consolidation in rats . .

18726527|In the present study , we investigated the effect of direct infusion of MPD into the basolateral nucleus of amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- or the anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- on conditioned fear memory .

18723684|Rin1 was shown to suppress synaptic plasticity in the amygdala , a forebrain structure important for fear learning , possibly by internalizing synaptic receptors .

18707030|The fear network , composed by the hippocampus , the medial prefrontal cortex , the amygdala and its brainstem projections , may be abnormally sensitive in PD patients .

18706510|Previous studies have reported that drugs affecting neuromodulatory systems within the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , including drugs affecting muscarinic cholinergic receptors , modulate the consolidation of many kinds of training , including contextual fear conditioning -LRB- CFC -RRB- .

18703092|Altered synapsin I immunoreactivity and fear behavior in male and female rats subjected to long-term amygdala kindling . .

18700839|Disruption of TIP39 projections to the medial prefrontal cortex , lateral septum , bed nucleus of the stria terminalis , hypothalamus and amygdala likely account for the fear - and anxiety-related phenotype of TIP39-KO .

18695245|The amygdala is a key limbic area involved in fear responses and pavlovian conditioning with the potential to directly respond to endocrine signals associated with fear or stress .

18695245|To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms and subregional specificity of fear conditioning , we disrupted type II glucocorticoid receptors -LRB- GRs -RRB- in the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- by delivering lentiviral vectors containing Cre-recombinase into floxed-GR mice .

18691662|Differential roles of the basolateral amygdala and nucleus basalis magnocellularis during post-reactivation contextual fear conditioning reconsolidation in rats . .

18691662|The roles of the basolateral amygdala and nucleus basalis magnocellularis in fear conditioning reconsolidation were investigated by means of tetrodotoxin bilateral inactivation performed 96 h after conditioning , immediately after reactivation training .

18691662|Basolateral amygdala inactivation disrupts the contextual fear response and its generalization but not acoustic CS trace retention , when measured 72 and 96 h after tetrodotoxin administration .

18691560|A second experiment used male rats from the fourth generation to investigate the participation of the amygdala during contextual fear conditioning in the CHF and CLF lines .

18680159|Beta1 - and beta2-adrenoceptors in basolateral nucleus of amygdala and their roles in consolidation of fear memory in rats . .

18680159|It is known that beta-adrenoceptor -LRB- AR -RRB- in the basolateral nucleus of amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- plays an essential role in fear memory formation .

18678283|The Morris water maze , the novel object and novel place recognition tasks , and contextual fear conditioning were used to assess learning and memory associated with hippocampus/prefrontal cortex , perirhinal/hippocampal cortex , and amygdala function , respectively .

18675886|Extended fear conditioning reveals a role for both N-methyl-D-aspartic acid and non-N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors in the amygdala in the acquisition of conditioned fear . .

18675886|The amygdala has been repeatedly implicated as playing a significant role in the acquisition and expression of fear .

18675886|If the amygdala is critical for the acquisition of fear , then it should contribute to this processes regardless of the parameters used to induce or evaluate conditioned fear .

18675886|A series of experiments using reversible inactivation techniques evaluated the role of the amygdala in the acquisition of conditioned fear when training was conducted over several days in rats .

18675886|Pretraining infusions of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid -LRB- NMDA -RRB- or non-NMDA receptor antagonists alone into the amygdala interfered with the acquisition of fear early in training , but not later .

18675886|Taken together these results suggest the amygdala may potentially be critical for the acquisition of conditioned fear regardless of the parameters utilized .

18667157|Neuropeptide S-mediated control of fear expression and extinction : role of intercalated GABAergic neurons in the amygdala . .

18667157|Here , we report that neuropeptide S -LRB- NPS -RRB- , a recently discovered transmitter of ascending brainstem neurons , evokes anxiolytic effects and facilitates extinction of conditioned fear responses when administered into the amygdala in mice .

18667157|These results identify mechanisms of NPS in the brain , a key role of intercalated neurons in the amygdala for fear extinction , and a potential pharmacological avenue for treating anxiety disorders .

18655902|Oxytocin potently reduced amygdala activation and decreased coupling to brainstem regions implicated in autonomic and behavioural manifestations of fear , indicating a neural mechanism for the effects of oxytocin in social cognition in humans and providing a potential therapeutic approach to social anxiety currently being tested in social phobia and autism .

18655833|The amygdala 's historical role in processing stimuli related to threat and fear is being modified to suggest a role that is broader and more abstract .

18655833|Other studies in rats and humans revive earlier proposals that the amygdala is important not only for fear perception as such , but also for detecting saliency and biological relevance .

18634894|The amygdala , the dorsal periaqueductal gray -LRB- dPAG -RRB- , and the medial hypothalamus have long been recognized to be a neural system responsible for the generation and elaboration of unconditioned fear in the brain .

18634894|However , whereas there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that the amygdala and dPAG are also able to integrate conditioned fear , it is still unclear , however , how the distinct hypothalamic nuclei participate in fear conditioning .

18634767|Conditioned fear inhibits c-fos mRNA expression in the central extended amygdala . .

18634767|As expected , fear conditioned animals that were not injected with amphetamine , had extremely low levels of c-fos mRNA in the central extended amygdala .

18634767|These data suggest that conditioned fear can inhibit neurons of the central extended amygdala .

18634767|Because these neurons are GABAergic , and project to the medial CEA -LRB- an amygdaloid output region -RRB- , this may be a novel mechanism whereby conditioned fear potentiates amygdaloid output .

18633816|Using movies , fear activated the amygdala and disgust the insula , but other emotions activated these structures to a similar degree .

18633792|A minority have impaired social responsiveness , poor discrimination of facial emotions -LRB- especially fear -RRB- , and abnormal amygdala-cortical connectivity .

18620025|The lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is a site of convergence for auditory -LRB- conditioned stimulus -RRB- and foot-shock -LRB- unconditioned stimulus -RRB- inputs during fear conditioning .

18619675|Lesion studies indicate the amygdala circuitry subserving fear conditioning is not necessary for unconditioned fear to TMT .

18617194|Given that the amygdala is a major emotional center in the brain and regulates the expression of both learned fear and anxiety , neurotransmitter systems within the basolateral amygdala represent likely mechanisms governing the anxiety-related effects of acute ethanol exposure .

18615015|Here , using the converse behavioural states of fear extinction and its context-dependent renewal as a model in mice , we show that bi-directional transitions between states of high and low fear are triggered by a rapid switch in the balance of activity between two distinct populations of basal amygdala neurons .

18615014|Intercalated -LRB- ITC -RRB- amygdala neurons constitute probable mediators of extinction because they receive information about the conditioned stimulus from the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , and contribute inhibitory projections to the central nucleus -LRB- CEA -RRB- , the main output station of the amygdala for conditioned fear responses .

18604284|This literature has implicated the amygdala , a structure in the brain 's temporal lobe , in the learning and consolidation of fear memories .

18604284|Its role in fear conditioning has been confirmed , but the human amygdala also interacts with cortical regions to mediate other aspects of emotional memory .

18601929|The obtained results underline also the role of frontal cortex and amygdala in mediating the effects of CRF on the conditioned fear response .

18596617|Aim of this study was to explore whether this effect is mediated by the basolateral amygdala , a crucial brain structure for acquisition of conditioned fear .

18596617|Therefore , AMN082 was locally injected into the basolateral amygdala of rats and the effects of these injections on the acquisition of conditioned fear was measured .

18596617|This finding demonstrates that amygdaloid mGluR7 controls the learning of conditioned fear .

18591471|The relations between events that produce fear conditioning are simple ; these relations and their fear products involve circuits in the amygdala that are well understood , as are those circuits in the amygdala that underlie LTP .

18591471|The evidence that links LTP in the amygdala with fear conditioning is reviewed .

18590724|Although much has been learned about the role of the amygdala in Pavlovian fear conditioning , relatively little is known about the signaling pathway involved in the acquisition of an active avoidance reaction .

18579781|Neuroligin-1 is required for normal expression of LTP and associative fear memory in the amygdala of adult animals . .

18579781|By silencing endogenous neuroligin-1 acutely in the amygdala of live behaving animals , we have found that neuroligin-1 is required for the storage of associative fear memory .

18577397|In addition , a few studies have reported an involvement of the basolateral and medial nucleus of the amygdala and hippocampus in fear conditioning .

18573512|After learning , objects were presented alone ; amygdala activity was greater for the fear -LRB- vs. neutral -RRB- and happy -LRB- vs. neutral -RRB- associated object .

18573512|Importantly , greater amygdala-hippocampal activity during fear -LRB- vs. neutral -RRB- learning predicted better recognition of learned objects on a subsequent memory test .

18573512|Neuroticism positively correlated with neural activity in the amygdala and hippocampus during fear -LRB- vs. neutral -RRB- learning .

18573264|Conditioning-strength dependent involvement of NMDA NR2B subtype receptor in the basolateral nucleus of amygdala in acquisition of auditory fear memory . .

18573264|It is known that N-methyl-D-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- receptor in the basolateral nucleus of amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is essential for fear memory formation .

18564045|This observation is consistent with the common view that the amygdala encodes fear and is preferentially responsive to negative stimuli .

18563394|Effects of gastrin-releasing peptide agonist and antagonist administered to the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala on conditioned fear in the rat . .

18563393|EGb761 was infused into cerebroventricle or basolateral nucleus of amygdala 10 min prior to fear conditioning .

18562331|Dissociable roles for the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala in fear extinction : NR2B contribution . .

18562331|Fear extinction , which involves learning to suppress the expression of previously learned fear , requires N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors -LRB- NMDARs -RRB- and is mediated by the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- .

18551525|Enrichment of Wfs1 protein in the central extended amygdala suggests a role in the modulation of anxiety and fear .

18550763|Contextual fear conditioning in humans : cortical-hippocampal and amygdala contributions . .

18550592|A study using event-related functional neuroimaging indicated that errors in fear detection in schizophrenia are associated with paradoxically higher activation in the amygdala and an associated network implicated in threat detection .

18540880|The human amygdala responds selectively to consciously and unconsciously perceived facial expressions , particularly those that convey potential threat such as fear and anger .

18540778|Subtraction of treatment minus baseline activation during the fear condition yielded significant -LRB- p = .001 -RRB- activation in the right amygdala and a nonsignificant increase in activation in the left amygdala .

18534264|The inferior colliculus -LRB- IC -RRB- together with the dorsal periaqueductal gray -LRB- dPAG -RRB- , the amygdala and the medial hypothalamus make part of the brain aversion system , which has mainly been related to the organization of unconditioned fear .

18528706|Role of the extended amygdala in short-duration versus sustained fear : a tribute to Dr. Lennart Heimer . .

18528706|Measuring fear-potentiated startle test using conditioned stimuli that vary in length we suggest that the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- and the lateral division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -LRB- L -RRB- -RRB- are involved in short-term versus long-term fear responses we call phasic versus sustained fear , respectively .

18528706|Outputs from the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- activate the medial division of the CeA -LRB- CeA -LRB- M -RRB- -RRB- to very rapidly elicit phasic fear responses via CeA -LRB- M -RRB- projections to the hypothalamus and brainstem .

18519545|Although the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is essential for conditioned auditory fear memory , an emerging theme is that plasticity in multiple brain regions contributes to fear memory formation .

18513120|In addition to neuropsin 's participation in the hippocampal memory , amygdalar and cortical localization of the gene suggests extrahippocampal behavioral function , and the authors therefore examined neuropsin-deficient mice , including tests of sensory motor reflex , open field , light-dark transition , Rota-Rod , elevated plus-maze , hot plate , startle response-prepulse inhibition , Porsolt forced swim , Barnes maze , eight-arm radial maze , and contextual and cued fear conditioning tests .

18499280|In HS rats , the serotonergic lesion significantly disinhibited rat behavior controlled by fear , enhanced c-Fos expression in the dorsomedial prefrontal area , and increased the concentration of GABA in the basolateral amygdala , measured in vivo after the testing session of the conditioned fear test .

18498743|This difference in trust adaptation is associated with a specific reduction in activation in the amygdala , the midbrain regions , and the dorsal striatum in subjects receiving oxytocin , suggesting that neural systems mediating fear processing -LRB- amygdala and midbrain regions -RRB- and behavioral adaptations to feedback information -LRB- dorsal striatum -RRB- modulate oxytocin 's effect on trust .

18495880|Most importantly , naloxone enhanced the acquisition of fear on the behavioral level and changed the activation profile of the amygdala : whereas the control group showed rapidly decaying conditioned responses across trials , the naloxone group showed sustained conditioned responses in the amygdala .

18479717|Evidence of amygdala responsiveness to fear compared to neutral stimuli was found for whole faces , eye region only , and for faces with masked eyes .

18473172|Based on evidence from our laboratory the concept is introduced that neurotransmitters in the amygdala can modulate anxiety involving changes in fear learning and memories by effects on receptor mosaics in the fear circuits through wiring and volume transmission modes of communication .

18466342|Both LTP and LTD can also be induced in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- , a critical structure involved in fear conditioning .

18463174|The basolateral amygdala is necessary for learning but not relearning extinction of context conditioned fear . .

18463174|These data are consistent with a current model that attributes fear extinction to interactions between several neural substrates , including the amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex .

18457504|Cultural specificity in amygdala response to fear faces . .

18457504|The human amygdala robustly activates to fear faces .

18457504|Heightened response to fear faces is thought to reflect the amygdala 's adaptive function as an early warning mechanism .

18457504|Here we show that the bilateral amygdala response to fear faces is modulated by culture .

18457504|We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure amygdala response to fear and nonfear faces in two distinct cultures .

18457504|Native Japanese in Japan and Caucasians in the United States showed greater amygdala activation to fear expressed by members of their own cultural group .

18440037|Differential fear conditioning in Asperger 's syndrome : Implications for an amygdala theory of autism .

18432190|We characterized the following for the first time in the mouse : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the expression of the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway components at the protein level in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the time course of activation of phospho-activated MAPK in the LA after fear conditioning ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- if pharmacological inhibition of pMAPK could modulate the acquisition of FPS ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- the cell-type specificity of pMAPK in the LA after fear conditioning .

18428608|Clinically , it is has relevance to human behavior in that fear conditioning can be produced in humans , and damage to the amygdala prevents fear conditioning .

18424777|In light of the established connections of the posterior insula with the amygdala , we propose that integration of auditory and somatosensory modalities reported here may play a role in auditory fear conditioning .

18423428|In order to determine the function of the beta1-AR subtype in anxiety-like behavior , we investigated the change of beta1-AR expression by immunostaining in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- of rats treated by conditional fear training .

18418359|However , the amygdala , a brain area repeatedly implicated in fear and anxiety processes , is known to contain large numbers of SP-containing neurons and SP receptors .

18410955|Changes in amygdala neural activity that occur with the extinction of context-dependent conditioned fear stress . .

18410955|The purpose of the present study was to characterize functional changes in the amygdala that accompany the extinction of context-dependent conditioned fear stress in a rat , an animal model of anxiety .

18410955|These data suggest that the basal nucleus of the amygdala plays an essential role in the expression of context-dependent conditioned fear .

18410955|Further , this is the first study to demonstrate that CREB phosphorylation in the basal nucleus of the amygdala changes in parallel with the extinction of context-dependent conditioned fear .

18392107|One year later , participants viewed backwardly masked depictions of fear while functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure their amygdala and fusiform gyrus activation .

18392107|Negative affect , as measured during the experience-sampling procedure 1-year prior , was positively correlated with amygdala activation in response to these brief presentations of fear depictions .

18388767|Damage to the amygdala produces deficits in the ability to recognize fear due to attentional neglect of other people 's eyes .

18388767|Attention to other people 's eyes is reduced in young people with high psychopathic traits , thus accounting for their problems with fear recognition , and is consistent with amygdala dysfunction failing to promote attention to emotional salience in the environment .

18377997|FCM infusion into the rat amygdala before fear conditioning impaired both cued and contextual freezing , which were tested 24 or 48 h later .

18323571|Evidence suggests that plasticity of the amygdalar and hippocampal GABAergic system is critical for fear memory formation .

18323571|First , we demonstrate a transient reduction of GAD65 gene expression in the dorsal hippocampus -LRB- 6 h post training -RRB- and in the basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- 24 h post training -RRB- during distinct phases of fear memory consolidation .

18323571|This function appears to involve a modulation of neural activity patterns in the amygdalo-hippocampal pathway as indicated by a reduction in theta frequency synchronization between the amygdala and hippocampus of Gad65 -LRB- - / - -RRB- mice during the expression of generalized fear memory .

18308796|We therefore examined the role of eCBs in modulating fear responses using multiple-trial versions of trace -LRB- hippocampal-dependent -RRB- and delay -LRB- amygdala-dependent -RRB- Pavlovian fear conditioning .

18308474|The amygdala modulates memory consolidation with the storage of emotionally relevant information and plays a critical role in fear and anxiety .

18305243|Auditory fear conditioning , a model for fear learning , is thought to be mediated by synaptic changes in the cortical and thalamic inputs to the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- ; however , the specific roles of both pathways are still debated .

18295751|Developmental emergence of fear learning corresponds with changes in amygdala synaptic plasticity . .

18295751|Here , we confirmed the developmental emergence of odor fear conditioning in neonatal rat pups , and examined synaptic plasticity of inputs to the basolateral amygdala in vitro .

18295751|The results suggest that sensitive period deficits in fear conditioning may be related to impaired amygdala synaptic plasticity and the immature state of GABAergic inhibition and/or its modulation in the neonatal amygdala .

18294420|Dissociative PTSD was associated with enhanced activation in the ventral prefrontal cortex for conscious fear , and in the bilateral amygdala , insula and left thalamus for non-conscious fear compared to non-dissociative PTSD .

18280467|The actions of vasopressin in the amygdala and lateral septum may represent at least part of the neuronal substrate by which vasopressin influences fear and anxiety-related behavior and social recognition , respectively .

18257652|The amygdalae send impulses to the hypothalamus for activation of the sympathetic nervous system , to the reticular nucleus for increasing reflexes , to the nuclei of the trigeminal nerve and facial nerve for facial expressions of fear , and to the ventral tegmental area , locus coeruleus , and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus for activation of dopamine , norepinephrine and epinephrine release .

18256248|The effect of temporary amygdala inactivation on extinction and reextinction of fear in the developing rat : unlearning as a potential mechanism for extinction early in development . .

18256248|In experiment 1 , temporary inactivation of the amygdala -LRB- using bupivacaine , a sodium channel modulator -RRB- during extinction training impaired extinction of conditioned fear in 17 - and 24-d-old rats .

18247161|However , evidence suggests that estrogens may exert their influence on fear and anxiety within the amygdala .

18230675|To do so , we infused the NR1/NR2B receptor antagonist CP101 ,606 -LRB- 0.5 , 1.5 , or 4.5 microg/amygdala -RRB- or the NR1/NR2A-preferring antagonist NVP-AAM077 -LRB- 0.075 , 0.25 , 0.75 , or 2.5 microg/amygdala -RRB- into the amygdala prior to either fear conditioning -LRB- i.e. , light-shock pairings -RRB- or fear-potentiated startle testing .

18230675|The results suggest that amygdala NR1/NR2B receptors play a special role in fear memory formation , whereas NR1/NR2A receptors participate more generally in synaptic transmission .

18230673|We have previously shown that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase -LRB- ERK / MAPK -RRB- is transiently activated in anatomically restricted regions of the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- following Pavlovian fear conditioning and that blockade of ERK/MAPK activation in the LA impairs both fear memory consolidation and long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- in the amygdala , in vitro .

18226933|Auditory specific fear conditioning results in increased levels of synaptophysin in the basolateral amygdala . .

18226933|We have undertaken analysis to look for potential brain changes associated with this model by measuring levels of the synaptic vesicle protein , synaptophysin , in the basolateral nuclei of the amygdala following auditory fear conditioning .

18226933|These findings support the idea that synaptic plasticity associated with formation of fear conditioning to a single specific conditioned stimulus occurs within the basolateral nuclei of the amygdala .

18216773|This study compared the influences of mu-opioid receptor -LRB- MOR -RRB- activation in the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CEA -RRB- on unconditioned fear or anxiety-like responses in two models , the elevated plus maze , and the defensive burying test .

18216773|Our results demonstrate that MOR activation in the central amygdala exerts distinctive effects in two different models of unconditioned fear or anxiety-like responses , and suggest that opioids may exert context-specific regulation of amygdalar output circuits and behavioral responses during exposure to potential threats -LRB- open arms of the maze -RRB- vs discrete threats -LRB- predator odor -RRB- .

18204824|Strong and discrete expression of their receptors in the extended amygdala suggests a potential role in regulating stress responses , emotion , anxiety and fear ; however , there have been no functional studies to date to support this possibility .

18203622|UCR diminution was observed within several brain regions associated with fear learning , including the amygdala , anterior cingulate , auditory cortex , and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex when a CS continuously relative to intermittently predicted the UCS .

18190969|The amygdala functions as a switch between the anxiety-like patterns of T1 to the cognitive control of fear prevalent in T2 .

18185497|Variation in mouse basolateral amygdala volume is associated with differences in stress reactivity and fear learning . .

18185497|This profile is reminiscent of the increased fear processing and stress reactivity that is associated with amygdala excitability and reduced amygdala volume in humans carrying loss of function polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter and monoamine oxidase A genes .

18185497|Our study provides a unique example of how natural variation in amygdala volume associates with specific fear - and stress-related phenotypes in rodents , and further supports the role of amygdala dysfunction in anxiety disorders such as PTSD .

18165656|Auditory fear memory is thought to be maintained by fear conditioning-induced potentiation of synaptic efficacy , which involves enhanced expression of surface AMPA receptor -LRB- AMPAR -RRB- at excitatory synapses in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- .

19289887|The amygdala , for example , is involved in the normal fear response , determines the significance of external stimuli and triggers responses such as fight , flight and freezing .

18159243|This disturbance may stem from dysfunction of the amygdala , a brain region involved in fear processing .

18159243|We confirm , in a series of experiments comprised of cFos staining , behavioral analysis and neurochemical determinations , that ketamine interferes with the behavioral expression of fear and with normal fear processing in the amygdala and related brain regions .

18159243|We further show that the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine , but not the typical antipsychotic haloperidol nor an experimental glutamate receptor 2/3 agonist , inhibits ketamine 's effects and retains normal fear processing in the amygdala at a neurochemical level , despite the observation that fear-related behavior is still inhibited due to ketamine administration .

18157465|However , it is unclear whether stimulation of the ? -LRB- 2A -RRB- - ARs has a similar effect on fear conditioning that involves the amygdala and hippocampus .

18155183|The rostral anterior cingulate cortex modulates the efficiency of amygdala-dependent fear learning . .

18155183|The rostral anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- rACC -RRB- and the amygdala consistently emerge from neuroimaging studies as brain regions crucially involved in normal and abnormal fear processing .

18155183|The aim of this study is to investigate a possible top-down control of a specific rACC sub-region over amygdala activation during pavlovian fear acquisition .

18155183|The effects of these manipulations over amygdala function were investigated with a classical tone-shock associative fear conditioning paradigm in the rat .

18155183|Our results suggest that a subregion of the rACC is key to gating the efficiency of amygdala-dependent auditory fear conditioning learning .

18095276|In conclusion , while overall brain activation patterns are not related to the subjective anxiety response to CCK-4 , amygdala activation may be involved in the subjective perception of CCK-4-induced fear .

18088283|Training-induced changes in the expression of GABAA-associated genes in the amygdala after the acquisition and extinction of Pavlovian fear . .

18088283|In the current study we examined training-induced changes in the expression of GABA -LRB- A -RRB- - related genes and the binding of GABA receptor radioligands in the amygdala after the acquisition and extinction of Pavlovian fear .

18088283|With fear conditioning , we found decreased mRNA levels of alpha1 , alpha5 and GAD67 , as well as deceased benzodiazepine binding in the amygdala .

18088283|Together , these findings indicate that the acquisition of fear induced a downregulation of mRNA markers related to a decrease in amygdala GABAergic function , whereas the acquisition of fear extinction produced an upregulation of GABAergic markers related to enhanced GABAergic transmission .

18088282|The amygdala plays a key role in fear and anxiety .

18065158|The lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- receives axonal projections from the auditory thalamus , the medial geniculate nucleus -LRB- MGN -RRB- , and mediates auditory fear conditioning .

18058089|The distinction between phasic fear to imminent threat and sustained anxiety to temporally uncertain danger is suggested by psychopharmacological and behavioral evidence from ethological studies and can be traced back to distinct neuroanatomical systems , the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis .

18056543|However , event-related analysis revealed that whereas in controls greater amygdala activation was associated with correct identifications of threat-related -LRB- anger and fear -RRB- expressions , patients showed the opposite effect of greater limbic activation , portending misidentifications .

18052972|Pair-housing for 24 h with an unfamiliar rat following fear conditioning resulted in a suppressed autonomic , but not behavioral , response , with Fos expression in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray .

18052972|These results demonstrate that two types of social buffering differentially relieve conditioned fear responses , by influencing different neural pathways in the amygdala .

18037014|Brain imaging studies show that PTSD patients have increased amygdala reactivity during fear acquisition .

18024182|The amygdala is clearly implicated in the processing of biologically relevant stimuli , particularly those that can lead to a state of fear .

18019606|Numerous studies suggest that the amygdala is critical for the acquisition and expression of fear .

18019606|Those disorders involving intense fear and panic -- panic disorder , post-traumatic stress disorder , and phobias -- seem to be characterized by an underactivity of the prefrontal cortex , thus disinhibiting the amygdala .

18005496|This excessive amygdala response to fear may reflect difficulty in managing anxiety reactions elicited during CBT , and this factor may limit optimal response to therapy .

17997114|Here , we propose an integrative review of findings derived from neurobiological models of fear conditioning and fear extinction , PTSD , and sleep-wake regulation , suggesting that the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex can directly contribute to sleep disturbances in PTSD .

17995911|This effect , however , was not fear specific because other affective materials evoked comparable signal strength in the amygdala .

17988803|Activation of basolateral amygdala corticotropin-releasing factor 1 receptors modulates the consolidation of contextual fear . .

17988803|The basolateral amygdala complex -LRB- BLA -RRB- and central amygdala nucleus -LRB- CeA -RRB- are involved in fear and anxiety .

17977027|Finally , a series of recent experiments from our laboratory studying the role of a specific signaling pathway -LRB- mTOR -RRB- which regulates translational processes and memory formation in the amygdala and hippocampus during fear conditioning are reviewed .

17970731|The effect of CB -LRB- 1 -RRB- receptor antagonism in the right basolateral amygdala on conditioned fear and associated analgesia in rats . .

17970731|The present study investigated the effects of administration of the cannabinoid -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- CB -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- receptor antagonist SR141716A into the right basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- on expression of conditioned fear , formalin-evoked nociceptive behaviour , fear-conditioned analgesia and associated alterations in monoamine levels in discrete rat brain areas .

17962049|They showed that neurons in the lateral amygdala compete to take part in auditory fear conditioned memory traces and that the levels of the transcription factor CREB -LRB- cAMP-response element binding protein -RRB- can affect the probability of a neuron to be recruited into a given memory representation .

17948876|Activation of group II metabotropic glutamate receptors -LRB- mGluR2/3 -RRB- in the amygdala plays a critical role in the regulation of fear and anxiety states .

17941996|Differences in activity in right frontal areas may indicate a dysfunctional PFC , which may lead to diminished extinction of conditioned fear and reduced inhibition of the amygdala .

17928436|A pathway-specific function for different AMPA receptor subunits in amygdala long-term potentiation and fear conditioning . .

17928436|It remains unclear , however , to what extent different amygdala pathways depend on GluR1 , or other AMPA receptor subunits , for proper synaptic transmission and plasticity , and whether GluR1-dependent long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- is necessary for auditory and contextual fear conditioning .

17928436|Here , we dissected the role of GluR1 and GluR3 -LRB- GluR-C -RRB- subunits in AMPA receptor-dependent amygdala LTP and fear conditioning using knock-out mice -LRB- GluR1 - / - and GluR3 - / - -RRB- .

17928436|Because both auditory and contextual fear conditioning were selectively impaired in GluR1 - / - but not GluR3 - / - mice , we conclude that GluR1-dependent synaptic plasticity is the dominant form of LTP underlying the acquisition of auditory and contextual fear conditioning , and that plasticity in distinct amygdala pathways differentially contributes to aversive conditioning .

17916608|GABAergic medial paracapsular intercalated -LRB- Imp -RRB- neurons of amygdala are thought of as playing a central role in fear learning and extinction .

17916608|We propose that the heterogeneous functional connectivity of Imp neurons , demonstrated by this study , is required to maintain the stability of firing patterns which is critical for the computational role of the amygdala in fear learning and extinction .

17900634|Influence of massed and distributed context preexposure on contextual fear and Egr-1 expression in the basolateral amygdala . .

17900634|The acquisition of context-conditioned fear was associated with enhanced Egr-1 expression in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

17900567|The amygdala-ventral periaqueductal gray circuit is crucial for the expression of contextual conditioned fear .

17898152|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is a major emotional center in the brain and regulates the expression of both learned fear and anxiety .

17892954|Our results suggest that down-regulation of the 5-HT system in the limbic system , i.e. , the reduction of the hippocampus 5-HT content and the amygdala 5-HT -LRB- 1A -RRB- receptor expression , may be involved in the exercise-enhanced fear memory .

17888462|N150 in amygdalar ERPs in the rat : is there modulation by anticipatory fear ? .

17887964|These may be associated with hippocampal atrophy seen on Magnetic Resonance Imaging and memory impairment as well as altered fear processing and transient hypertrophy of the amygdala .

17882991|-LSB- The role of the lateral nucleus of amygdala in fear conditioning learning and memory -RSB- . .

17880899|These different neuronal populations may subserve two sorts of processes mediated by the amygdala : those activated by surprising reinforcements of both valences-such as enhanced arousal and attention-and those that are valence-specific , such as fear or reward-seeking behavior .

17848503|The central nucleus of the amygdala is essential for acquiring and expressing conditional fear after overtraining . .

17848503|The basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is critical for the acquisition and expression of Pavlovian fear conditioning in rats .

17848503|The capacity of rats with BLA lesions to acquire fear memory may be mediated by the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CEA -RRB- .

17845909|On the basis of the case study of a patient unable to recognize fearful faces , Adolphs et al. -LSB- R. Adolphs , F. Gosselin , T.W. Buchanan , D. Tranel , P. Schyns , A.R. Damasio , A mechanism for impaired fear recognition after amygdala damage , Nature 433 -LRB- 2005 -RRB- 68-72 -RSB- suggested that the amygdala might play a role in orienting attention towards the eyes , i.e. towards the region of face conveying most information about fear .

17826749|Enduring effects of infant memories : infant odor-shock conditioning attenuates amygdala activity and adult fear conditioning . .

17826749|Here we assess early life learning about adverse experience and its consequences on adult fear conditioning and amygdala activity .

17823306|KORs and their endogenous ligand dynorphin are expressed throughout brain areas involved in fear and anxiety , including the extended amygdala .

17761885|We found neurons in the basolateral amygdala that are activated during Pavlovian fear conditioning and are reactivated during memory retrieval .

17726475|Research across species highlights the critical role of the amygdala in fear conditioning .

17726475|We review research suggesting that an amygdala-centered model of fear conditioning can help to explain social learning of fear through observation and instruction .

17715358|The amygdala plays a central role in fear conditioning , emotional processing , and memory modulation .

17712315|mGluR7 activation also blocked the acquisition of Pavlovian fear learning and its electrophysiological correlate long-term potentiation in the amygdala .

17709755|Long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- in auditory inputs to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala was recently linked to the acquisition of fear memory .

17709755|Therefore we explored whether LTP induction at thalamo-amygdala projections , conveying the acoustic conditioned stimulus information to the amygdala during fear conditioning , is under adrenergic control .

17706612|The amygdala is implicated as a key brain structure in fear processing .

17706612|Studies exploring this process using the paradigm of fear conditioning have implicated the amygdala in fear acquisition and in generating behavioral fear responses .

17706612|As such , fear extinction could be expected to induce a reduction in amygdala activity .

17698998|The amygdala is implicated in generating fear responses , whereas cortical regions , specifically the medial OFC -LRB- mOFC -RRB- and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- , are implicated in fear extinction .

17680805|Serotonin levels have previously been implicated in fear and aggression , through modulation of the neural pathway connecting the prefrontal cortex and amygdala .

17673336|In addition , induction of c-Fos following cued and contextual fear conditioning was significantly impaired in the basolateral amygdala and hippocampus of APP -LSB- V717I -RSB- transgenic mice .

17666080|Previous research has demonstrated that suppression of inhibition in projection neurons of the basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- represents an essential mechanism underlying the emergence of negative emotional responses , including exaggerated fear and anxiety .

17663597|The role of dorsal hippocampus and basolateral amygdala NMDA receptors in the acquisition and retrieval of context and contextual fear memories . .

17663597|However , both DL-AP5 and L-AP5 reduced the expression of fear when they were injected into the amygdala prior to testing for contextual fear .

17662962|Our immunohistochemistry suggested ASIC1a is expressed in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis , medial amygdala , and periaqueductal gray , which are thought to play important roles in the generation and expression of innate fear .

17651704|Results also revealed a repetition-suppression effect for fearful faces in the right amygdala , which arose in healthy control subjects only , suggesting a lack of amygdala modulation by fear expression in 22q11DS .

17644267|Contextual fear memory was enhanced in the rats 1 week after SPS exposure , whereas LTP in the amygdala was blunted .

17637475|Consistent with these anxiolytic-like effects , in vivo microdialysis showed that acute galnon -LRB- 3mg/kg , i.p. -RRB- treatment preferentially elevated levels of GABA in the rat amygdala , a brain area linked to fear and anxiety behaviors .

17626906|Laboratory animal and human subject studies report that the amygdala is a critical brain structure that supports the acquisition and expression of conditional fear .

17626199|In experiment 1 , we assessed the role of the primate amygdala and hippocampus in the acquisition of learned fear measured with fear-potentiated startle .

17625503|T or 3alpha-diol , but not E -LRB- 2 -RRB- , enhanced anti-anxiety behavior in the elevated plus maze , zero maze , and the Vogel task , and increased motor behavior in the activity monitor , latency to fall in the Roto-rod task , and cognitive performance in the hippocampally-mediated , but not the amygdala-mediated , portion of the conditioned fear task and in the inhibitory avoidance task .

17613254|Biphasic ERK1/2 activation in both the hippocampus and amygdala may reveal a system consolidation of contextual fear memory . .

17613254|Taken together , our data suggest that the observed biphasic pattern of neuronal plastic events may reflect the interplay between hippocampal and amygdala activity-dependent plasticity critical for the system consolidation of contextual fear memory .

17610589|Glucocorticoid receptors in the basolateral nucleus of amygdala are required for postreactivation reconsolidation of auditory fear memory . .

17610589|Although it is well established that glucocorticoid receptors -LRB- GR -RRB- in the basolateral nucleus of amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- are required for consolidation of fear memory , little is known about their role in reconsolidation of fear memory .

17601709|This was due to the BPD group exhibiting a significantly larger magnitude of deactivation -LRB- relative to HC -RRB- in the bilateral rostral/subgenual anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- to fear and in the left ACC to fear minus neutral ; and significantly greater activation in the right amygdala to fear minus neutral .

17601709|In voxel-wise analyses constrained within these ROIs , the BPD group exhibited significant changes in the fear minus neutral contrast , with relatively less activation in the bilateral rostral/subgenual ACC , and greater activation in the right amygdala .

17601709|We conclude that adults with BPD exhibit changes in fronto-limbic activity in the processing of fear stimuli , with exaggerated amygdala response and impaired emotion-modulation of ACC activity .

17599366|Consistent with the hypothesis that the amygdala is central to fear activation , brain imaging studies show that fear stimuli activate the amygdala , even when conscious recognition is prevented by backward masking .

17599366|The bulk of the data suggest that the amygdala can be activated from potentially accessible but unattended fear stimuli .

17589308|We have recently demonstrated high theta-phase synchronization between the lateral amygdala and CA1 area of the hippocampus during retrieval of long-term -LRB- 1 day -RRB- fear memory , and not during short-term -LRB- 2 h -RRB- or remote memory retrieval -LRB- 30 days -RRB- .

17589308|These data indicate that the reconsolidation of remote contextual fear memory includes changes in ensemble activities between the lateral amygdala and CA1 .

17587502|Amygdala-dependent and amygdala-independent pathways for contextual fear conditioning . .

17587502|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , consisting of the lateral and basal nuclei , is considered to be essential for fear learning .

17570684|The present imaging data clearly indicate that animals with no prior exposure to a threat-inducing emotional stimulus selectively activated the unconditional fear neuronal pathway , specifically with heightened amygdala and hypothalamic activation .

17568631|The finding complements earlier demonstrations that damage to the right amygdala is associated with impaired processing of fear ; amelioration of right amygdala function may conversely be associated with an improvement .

17561172|Spared ability to recognise fear from static and moving whole-body cues following bilateral amygdala damage . .

17561172|Bilateral amygdala lesions impair the ability to identify certain emotions , especially fear , from facial expressions , and neuroimaging studies have demonstrated differential amygdala activation as a function of the emotional expression of faces , even under conditions of subliminal presentation , and again especially for fear .

17561172|On the basis of its known connectivity as well as prior studies in humans and animals , we hypothesised that the amygdala would be important also for the recognition of fear from body expressions .

17561172|To test this hypothesis , we assessed a patient -LRB- S.M. -RRB- with complete bilateral amygdala lesions who is known to be severely impaired at recognising fear from faces .

17561172|Compared to healthy comparison subjects , neither of the amygdala lesion subjects was impaired in identifying fear from any of these displays .

17561172|Thus , whatever the role of the amygdala in processing whole-body fear cues , it is apparently not necessary for the normal recognition of fear from either static or dynamic body expressions .

17554526|Possible parallels between RC users and psychopaths with respect to impaired fear recognition , amygdala dysfunction , and etiology are discussed .

17553730|Recent neuroimaging studies of conditioned fear , attention to threat and interpretation of emotionally ambiguous stimuli indicate common amygdala-prefrontal circuitry underlying these processes , and suggest that the balance of activity within this circuitry is altered in anxiety , creating a bias towards threat-related responses .

17547581|Responses to fear and disgust -LRB- within-group analyses -RRB- resulted in activation of anticipated brain regions such as amygdala and insula , respectively .

17547581|Greater responsiveness to fear with hippocampal activation in patients perhaps reflects recollection of traumatic events associated with past experiences of illness or simply the use of a more mnemonic -LRB- hippocampal -RRB- as opposed to affective -LRB- amygdala -RRB- approach when performing the task .

17537966|The amygdala has been studied extensively for its critical role in associative fear conditioning in animals and humans .

17537966|Noxious stimuli , such as those used for fear conditioning , are most effective in eliciting behavioral responses and amygdala activation when experienced in an unpredictable manner .

17525984|Enhanced amygdala and medial prefrontal activation during nonconscious processing of fear in posttraumatic stress disorder : an fMRI study . .

17525984|Biological models of posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- suggest that patients will display heightened amygdala but decreased medial prefrontal activity during processing of fear stimuli .

17522182|In this issue of Molecular Pharmacology , Ou and Gean -LRB- p. 350 -RRB- thoroughly describe the molecular cascade by which fear learning leads to an increase in BDNF expression in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- .

17522021|These data reveal a novel role for the hippocampus in regulating the context-specific firing of lateral amygdala neurons after fear memory extinction .

17507914|Abnormal fear conditioning and amygdala processing in an animal model of autism . .

17507914|Among other brain regions , a deficit in amygdala processing has been suggested to underlie this impairment , but whether the amygdala is processing fear abnormally in autism , is yet not clear .

17507914|We used the valproic acid -LRB- VPA -RRB- rat model of autism to -LRB- a -RRB- screen for autism-like symptoms in rats , -LRB- b -RRB- test for alterations in amygdala-dependent fear processing , and -LRB- c -RRB- evaluate neuronal reactivity and synaptic plasticity in the lateral amygdala by means of in vitro single-cell electrophysiological recordings .

17507102|Although recent work on amygdalar function has concentrated on a role in fear and anxiety , a possible role in reward processes continues to be considered .

17502909|Converging evidence indicates that extinction of fear memory requires plasticity in both the medial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala .

17466022|Reversible inactivation of amygdala and cerebellum but not perirhinal cortex impairs reactivated fear memories . .

17466022|The cerebellum , amygdala and perirhinal cortex are involved in fear learning but the different roles that these three structures play in aversive learning are not well defined .

17466022|Here we show that in adult rats amygdala or cerebellar vermis blockade causes amnesia when performed immediately , but not 1 h , after the recall of fear memories .

17466022|Thus , the cerebellum , as well as the amygdala , influences long-term fear memories .

17466022|By increasing the strength of conditioning , we observed that stronger fear memories are affected by the combined but not independent amygdala and cerebellar blockade .

17466022|Furthermore , they suggest that the amygdala is only one of the neural sites underlying long-term fear memories .

17466022|Finally , the inactivation of the perirhinal cortex never alters retrieved fear traces , showing important differences between the amygdala , cerebellum and perirhinal cortex in emotional memories .

17462678|Using human neuroimaging to test this hypothesis , we report that the amygdala , a brain structure that is involved in fear processing and has been shown to exhibit activation level that is proportional to arousal in general , is significantly more active for everyday sharp objects -LRB- e.g. , a sofa with sharp corners -RRB- compared with their curved contour counterparts .

17456785|Transcriptional regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the amygdala during consolidation of fear memory . .

17456785|We have demonstrated previously that brain-derived neurotrophic factor -LRB- BDNF -RRB- signaling in the amygdala is required for the consolidation of fear memory .

17456785|Real-time reverse transcription-coupled polymerase chain reaction showed a significant increase in BDNF exon I - and III-containing mRNA in the amygdala of fear-conditioned rats , indicating that fear conditioning was capable of up-regulating BDNF mRNA .

17456785|The phosphorylated CREB binds to BDNF promoter and up-regulates the expression of BDNF in the amygdala , which helps the consolidation of fear memory .

17446403|Changes in CREB function influenced the probability that individual lateral amygdala neurons were recruited into a fear memory trace .

17445914|Lesion studies have shown that rat perirhinal cortex -LRB- PR -RRB- , a polymodal sensory region that is reciprocally connected with the amygdala , is critical for normal fear conditioning to so-called '' 22 kHz USVs '' .

17443804|Unlike LTP in the hippocampus and amygdala , two key structures for memory and fear , little is known about the synaptic mechanism for the expression of LTP in the ACC .

17425902|The involvement of the basolateral and the medial amygdala in fear conditioning was evaluated using different markers of neuronal activation .

17425902|The data provided by both techniques indicate that these amygdalar nuclei could play different roles on auditory and contextual fear conditioning .

17425583|Experiment 3 showed that the amygdala lesions used in this study were functionally significant because AMYG rats , from Experiment 2 , showed impairments in a discriminative fear conditioning to context paradigm .

17408428|The amygdala and the hippocampus are critically involved in the formation and retention of fear memories .

17398080|Schizophrenia patients show a disconnection in amygdala-medial prefrontal cortex and autonomic arousal systems for processing fear .

17398080|For controls , ` with-arousal ' responses were associated with emotion-specific activity for fear -LRB- amygdala -RRB- , disgust -LRB- insula -RRB- and anger -LRB- anterior cingulate -RRB- , together with common medial prefrontal cortex -LSB- MPFC -RSB- engagement , as predicted .

17398077|Serotonergic mechanisms in the basolateral amygdala differentially regulate the conditioned and unconditioned fear organized in the periaqueductal gray . .

17398077|Whereas 5-HT mechanisms in the amygdala facilitate the acquisition of conditioned fear they inhibit the dPAG-post-stimulation freezing .

17398077|However , the unconditioned fear triggered by activation of the dPAG is produced downstream of the amygdala .

17393440|Both pain conditions activated the pain matrix , but arthritic pain was associated with increased activity in the cingulate cortex , the thalamus , and the amygdala ; these areas are involved in the processing of fear , emotions , and in aversive conditioning .

17382305|In contrast , these mice showed normal hippocampus-dependent spatial memory in the Morris water maze test , as well as in cued fear and conditioned taste aversion memories , which are amygdala-dependent memory processes .

17376972|The amygdala is a critical site for the acquisition of learned fear memory in mammals , and the formation and long-term maintenance of fear memories are thought to be associated with changes of synaptic strength in the amygdala .

17376972|These results show , for the first time , that 5-HT can produce long-lasting facilitation of synaptic transmission in the amygdala and provides evidence for the possible synaptic role of 5-HT in long-term memory for learned fear .

17376704|Analyses focused on amygdala response during subjective ratings of internal fear -LRB- constrained attention -RRB- and passive viewing -LRB- unconstrained attention -RRB- during the presentation of emotion faces -LRB- Happy , Angry , Fearful , and Neutral -RRB- .

17376704|BI adolescents , relative to BN adolescents , showed exaggerated amygdala response during subjective fear ratings and deactivation during passive viewing , across all emotion faces .

17376704|In addition , the BI group showed an abnormally high amygdala response to a task condition marked by novelty and uncertainty -LRB- i.e. , rating fear state to a Happy face -RRB- .

17354378|Second , the amygdala seems to be very concerned to recognition of facial expressions , especially fear .

17354378|The amygdala and the superior temporal sulcus are related to gaze recognition , which explains why a patient with bilateral amygdala damage could not recognize only a fear expression ; the information from eyes is necessary for fear recognition .

17354069|It has been well established that the amygdala is critical for processing various aspects of emotion , and in particular , for the perception of negative emotions such as fear .

17351634|Synapse-specific reconsolidation of distinct fear memories in the lateral amygdala . .

17351634|Here , we show in rats that fear memory retrieval produces a synaptic potentiation in the lateral amygdala that is selective to the reactivated memory , and that disruption of reconsolidation is correlated with a reduction of synaptic potentiation in the lateral amygdala .

17347350|The amygdalar system is a key region for gating stimulation to cortical regions and the medial amygdala appears to play an especially key role in mediating the fear response .

17339967|An interaction was observed in the right amygdala when subtle happy and fear faces were juxtaposed with positive and negative movies , respectively .

17335325|Prior imaging studies suggest that patients with major depressive disorder have abnormalities in frontal and limbic neural circuitry including the amygdala , which is relatively more activated at rest and in response to negative emotional stimuli -LRB- sadness , fear , etc. -RRB- in depressed patients than in controls .

17331216|Plasticity of inhibitory synaptic network interactions in the lateral amygdala upon fear conditioning in mice . .

17331216|After fear conditioning , plastic changes of excitatory synaptic transmission occur in the amygdala .

17331216|In the present study we assessed the influence of Pavlovian fear conditioning on the plasticity of GABAergic synaptic interactions in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- in brain slices prepared from fear-conditioned , pseudo-trained and naïve adult mice .

17329980|Animal models of fear learning have elucidated a neural circuit for extinction learning and recall that includes the amygdala , ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- , and hippocampus .

17329980|Whereas the amygdala is important for extinction learning , the vmPFC is a site of neural plasticity that allows for the inhibition of fear during extinction recall .

17329410|The central amygdala joins the lateral amygdala in the fear memory party . .

17324054|Predator odor-induced conditioned fear involves the basolateral and medial amygdala . .

17324054|The basolateral -LRB- BLA -RRB- and medial nucleus -LRB- MeA -RRB- of the amygdala participate in the modulation of unconditioned fear induced by predator odor .

17324054|However , the specific role of these amygdalar nuclei in predator odor-induced fear memory is not known .

17321555|Differential fear conditioning in Asperger 's syndrome : implications for an amygdala theory of autism . .

17320060|Furthermore , it seems that the medial amygdaloid-DR projection might be anatomically and functionally distinct from the well-characterized central amygdaloid-periaqeductal gray -LRB- PAG -RRB- circuit which is essential for conditioned fear .

17303088|The similar time course of fearful cue-induced changes in neurotransmitter release and changes in arousal and REM sleep suggests that alterations in amygdalar neurotransmission may be involved in the changes in arousal and sleep that occur after fear .

17292864|Blockade of amygdala metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 1 impairs fear extinction . .

17292864|Here , we examined a role of mGluR1 in the extinction of conditioned fear using microinjection of an mGluR1 antagonist , CPCCOEt , into the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- , a critical structure for fear conditioning and extinction .

17292864|Together , our results suggest that amygdala mGluR1 plays a critical role in the extinction of learned fear , but not in the acquisition of fear memory .

17285093|Primitive brain systems involved in fear responsivity and survival also mediate smell , including the olfactory cortex and amygdala .

17275189|We therefore explored ALLO effects on GABA neurotransmission in the central nucleus -LRB- Ce -RRB- of the amygdala , a major output nucleus involved in fear and anxiety .

17270466|We find that viewing neutral and fearful body expressions enhances amygdala activity ; moreover actions expressing fear activate the temporal pole and lateral orbital cortex more than neutral actions ; and finally differences in activations between static and dynamic bodily expressions were larger for actions expressing fear in the STS and premotor cortex compared to neutral actions .

17267796|Increased amygdala reactivity during processing of certain types of emotional stimuli -LRB- e.g. , fear , anger -RRB- has been observed in patients with anxiety disorders such as social phobia and posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- .

17259015|Behavioural studies have shown that the central -LRB- CeA -RRB- and basolateral -LRB- BLA -RRB- nuclei of amygdala differentially regulate conditioned and unconditioned fear .

17259013|Dynamic neural activity recorded from human amygdala during fear conditioning using magnetoencephalography . .

17259013|Magnetoencephalography -LRB- MEG -RRB- was used to record the dynamics of amygdala neuronal population activity during fear conditioning in human participants .

17255010|For example , the amygdala attaches emotional value to faces , enabling us to recognize expressions such as fear and trustworthiness , while the posterior superior temporal sulcus predicts the end point of the complex trajectories created when agents act upon the world .

17251424|The amygdala has long been considered to be both necessary and sufficient for classical fear conditioning , but recent evidence suggests that the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- may also be involved .

17251424|We suggest that PL integrates information from auditory and contextual inputs and regulates expression of fear memories via projections to the basal nucleus of the amygdala .

17250857|We outline the possible role of the pulvinar in fear recognition , considering both the pulvinar 's direct and indirect cortical connections with the amygdala , and we suggest that the integrative role of the pulvinar may be primary .

17240844|Both clinical studies and animal studies have indicated that the amygdala plays an essential role in anxiety and fear response .

17239106|ERs -LRB- always fear -RRB- were maximal at the amygdala -LRB- 12 % -RRB- and minimal for lateral neocortical stimulation -LRB- 3 % , p < 0.01 -RRB- .

17234600|Likewise , rodent and nonhuman primate studies indicate a major role for PFC and amygdala in the mediation of fear - and stress-related behaviors .

17234600|We used a 5-HTT knock-out -LRB- KO -RRB- mouse to examine the effects of genetically driven loss of 5-HTT function for the following : -LRB- 1 -RRB- depression-related behavior in response to repeated stress , and pavlovian fear conditioning , extinction , and extinction recall ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- dendritic morphology and spine density of Golgi-stained pyramidal neurons in the infralimbic cortex -LRB- IL -RRB- and the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

17228778|Second , the amygdala seems to be very concerned to recognition of facial expressions , especially fear .

17228778|The amygdala and the superior temporal sulcus are related to gaze recognition , which explains why a patient with bilateral amygdala damage could not recognize only a fear expression ; the information from eyes is necessary for fear recognition .

17223582|The amygdala has been critically involved in the processing of fear memories and a number of molecular changes have been implicated in this brain region in relation to fear learning .

17223582|We investigate here whether polysialylated NCAM -LRB- PSA-NCAM -RRB- contributes to auditory fear conditioning in the amygdala .

17223582|First , PSA-NCAM expression was evaluated in different amygdala nuclei after auditory fear conditioning at two different shock intensities .

17223582|Second , PSA-NCAM was cleaved in the basolateral amygdaloid complex through micro-infusions of the enzyme endoneuraminidase N , and the consequences of such treatment were investigated on the acquisition , consolidation , remote memory expression , and extinction of conditioned fear memories .

17223582|These results suggest that upregulation of PSA-NCAM is a correlate of fear conditioning that is not necessary for the establishment of fear memory in the amygdala , but participates in mechanisms precluding fear extinction .

17222539|Functional disconnections in the direct and indirect amygdala pathways for fear processing in schizophrenia . .

17222539|Schizophrenia patients show reduced neural activity , relative to controls , in the amygdala and its projection to the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- MPFC -RRB- in response to fear perception .

17222539|In this study we tested the hypothesis that schizophrenia is characterized by abnormal functional connectivity in the amygdala network underlying fear perception .

17218477|A mechanism for impaired fear recognition after amygdala damage .

17213844|Acquisition of fear extinction requires activation of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors in the lateral amygdala . .

17213844|Fear extinction , which involves learning to suppress the expression of previously learned fear , appears to require NMDAR activation in the amygdala .

17213844|However , it is unclear whether amygdala NMDARs are required for the acquisition of extinction learning , and it is unknown whether NR2B-containing NMDARs are required in fear extinction .

17213844|These results confirm previous evidence showing that NMDARs in the amygdala are involved in fear extinction , and additionally show that NR2B-containing NMDARs are required .

17213844|Thus , our results support a previously not known role for NMDA-dependent plasticity in the lateral amygdala during the acquisition of fear extinction .

17207780|Synapses onto dendritic spines in the lateral amygdala formed by afferents from the auditory thalamus represent a site of plasticity in Pavlovian fear conditioning .

17201461|Human amygdala activity during the expression of fear responses . .

17201461|Laboratory animal studies of Pavlovian fear conditioning suggest that the amygdala is important for both forming stimulus associations and for subsequently expressing learned behavioral responses .

17201461|In the present article , human amygdala activity was studied during the autonomic expression of conditional fear in two differential conditioning experiments with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging and concurrent recording of skin conductance responses -LRB- SCRs -RRB- .

17201461|These results indicate that amygdala activity may specifically reflect the expression of learned fear responses and support the position that this region plays a central role in the expression of emotional reactions .

17199059|While attending to their own subjective fear , patients , but not controls , showed greater activation to fearful faces than to happy faces in a distributed network including the amygdala , ventral prefrontal cortex , and anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- P < .05 , small-volume corrected , for all -RRB- .

17198729|Effects of brain lesions and peripherally administered drugs have implicated several brain areas and neurotransmitters that subserve memory , fear and reward in neotic preferences namely the hippocampus and ACh -LRB- memory -RRB- , the amygdala , GABA and 5-HT -LRB- fear -RRB- , and the mesolimbic DA reward system .

17195879|Preclinical studies have shown that the amygdala plays a key role in fear circuitry , and that abnormalities in amygdala pathways can affect the acquisition and expression of fear conditioning .

17192439|Ample data indicate that tone and contextual fear conditioning differentially require the amygdala and the hippocampus .

17192439|Using pavlovian fear conditioning in mice , we first show a higher level of hippocampal acetylcholine release and a specific pattern of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 -LRB- ERK1/2 -RRB- activation within the lateral -LRB- LA -RRB- and basolateral -LRB- BLA -RRB- amygdala under conditions in which the context is a better predictor than a discrete tone stimulus .

17188251|Analyses focused on the temporal dynamics of the amygdala , prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- , and fusiform face area -LRB- FFA -RRB- across blocks of neutral , fear , contempt , anger , and happy faces in gSP versus HC participants .

17169443|Lesion , aspiration or inactivation of the hippocampus and amygdala impair conditioned fear to the trained context and cue , respectively .

17169443|Cued fear conditioning could not detect amygdala-dependent cognitive deficits after injury and stereological estimation of amygdala neuron number corroborated this finding .

17167087|Translational control via the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway is critical for the formation and stability of long-term fear memory in amygdala neurons . .

17167087|Furthermore , when rapamycin was applied to the amygdala after the recall of a previously stored fear memory , subsequent retention was disrupted , indicating that local translational control at active synapses is required for the stability as well as the formation of long-term memory in this system .

17156370|Synchronized and rhythmic activity within the amygdala is thought to play a pivotal role in the generation of fear - and anxiety-related behaviour .

17145508|Input-specific long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- in afferent inputs to the amygdala serves an essential function in the acquisition of fear memory .

17142302|We suggest that PL excites amygdala output and IL inhibits amygdala output , providing a mechanism for bidirectional modulation of fear expression .

17140740|Spatial orientation learning and reversal learning require complex integration of spatial information and response selection involving the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex , whereas cued fear conditioning is an associative type of emotional memory that highly depends on amygdala function .

17135400|Rethinking the fear circuit : the central nucleus of the amygdala is required for the acquisition , consolidation , and expression of Pavlovian fear conditioning . .

17135400|In the standard model of pavlovian fear learning , sensory input from neutral and aversive stimuli converge in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- , in which alterations in synaptic transmission encode the association .

17135400|During fear expression , the LA is thought to engage the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CE -RRB- , which serves as the principal output nucleus for the expression of conditioned fear responses .

17131200|The genetics that underlie variation in amygdala structure may be coupled to variation in levels of aggression , fear , anxiety , and affiliated behaviors .

17126861|The disproportionate impairment for the recognition of facial expressions of disgust in patients with Huntington 's disease -LRB- HD -RRB- forms a double dissociation with the impaired recognition of fear that has been reported in amygdala patients .

17126419|5-HT2 - and D1-mechanisms of the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala enhance conditioned fear and impair unconditioned fear . .

17118565|Hemispheric differences in protein kinase C betaII levels in the rat amygdala : baseline asymmetry and lateralized changes associated with cue and context in a classical fear conditioning paradigm . .

17118565|The amygdala is critically important for fear learning , and specific kinases have been implicated as contributors to the mechanisms that underlie learning .

17118565|We examined levels of protein kinase C betaII -LRB- PKC betaII -RRB- in the left and right lateral and basolateral nuclei -LRB- LA/BLA -RRB- of the amygdala from animals that were classically fear conditioned with tones as cues and footshocks .

17115806|N-methyl-D-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- receptors , as well as various intracellular cascades in the amygdala , are critical for fear learning , which is then mediated by glutamate acting in the CeA .

17113928|We wished to determine whether neurones of the nucleus of the solitary tract -LRB- NTS -RRB- or ventrolateral medulla -LRB- VLM -RRB- convey visceral afferent information to the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- or periaqueductal grey region -LRB- PAG -RRB- , structures that play a key role in adaptive autonomic responses triggered by stress or fear .

17107707|In rats chronically treated with corticosterone this effect was attenuated in the mPVN and DG , enhanced in the M1 , and additionally observed in the CA1 , CA2 layers of the hippocampus , and in the central nucleus of amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , in comparison to control animals not subjected to contextual fear test .

17099887|Finally , the prominent amygdala projection to the face region of M3 may significantly influence the outcome of higher-order facial expressions associated with social communication and emotional constructs such as fear , anger , happiness , and sadness .

17098299|The data suggest that despite cocaine 's reputation as a performance-enhancing and anxiogenic drug , this effect is seen only at very low doses , whereas a moderate dose disrupts hippocampus and amygdala-dependent fear conditioning .

17095252|Moreover , this route was specific for fear expressions ; the ERS response in the amygdala to angry expressions had a late onset -LRB- 150-160 ms -RRB- .

17087983|In contrast , a facilitatory interaction between GALR and Y1 receptors exists in the amygdala which may be of relevance for fear related behaviour .

17081505|The striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase gates long-term potentiation and fear memory in the lateral amygdala . .

17081505|Administration of TAT-STEP into the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- disrupts long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- and selectively disrupts fear memory consolidation .

17047672|Glutamate NMDA receptors within the amygdala participate in the modulatory effect of glucocorticoids on extinction of conditioned fear in rats . .

17047672|Control experiments indicated that co-administration of DEX and DCS did not alter the expression of conditioned fear and the effect was not due to lasting damage to the amygdala .

17033843|The role of gastrin-releasing peptide on conditioned fear : differential cortical and amygdaloid responses in the rat . .

17033843|The effects of these compounds on contextual and cued fear conditioning were assessed after direct bilateral infusions into the prelimbic -LRB- PrL -RRB- cortex , infralimbic -LRB- IL -RRB- cortex or central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- .

17025192|The involvement of the frontal cortex , amygdala , and the anterior cingulate cortex in the development of individual features of recognition of facial expressions of anger and fear is discussed .

17015856|Paradoxically , fear conditioning -LRB- odor-0 .5 mA shock -RRB- yields a learned odor preference in the neonate , presumably due to a unique learning and memory circuit that does not include apparent amygdala participation .

17015856|Furthermore , these results suggest that opioids are instrumental in suppressing neonate fear behavior via modulating the amygdala .

17005868|Thus , intrabasolateral amygdala DCS potentiated both the extinction and the reconsolidation of fear conditioning , depending on the length of the extinction/memory reactivation session .

17005717|Using whole-cell recordings from amygdala slices , we demonstrated that activity-dependent release of chelatable Zn2 + is required for the induction of spike timing-dependent long-term potentiation in cortical input to the amygdala implicated in fear learning .

16998481|We found that the presence of NMDA , but not AMPA , receptor antagonists in the amygdala prior to recall prevented the consolidated fear memory from returning to a labile state .

16997391|Brain areas investigated included the amygdala , periaqueductal gray -LRB- PAG -RRB- , and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- , all areas considered to be part of the '' fear circuit '' .

16996221|These results suggest that the hcrt/orx system can act through the amygdala to augment arousal and evoke the autonomic and behavioral responses associated with fear , stress or emotion .

16970965|The goal of the present study was to assess the specific role of the amygdala in the recognition of fear from music .

16957082|Mode of functional connectivity in amygdala pathways dissociates level of awareness for signals of fear . .

16957082|Using functional magnetic resonance imaging with connectivity analysis in healthy human subjects , we demonstrate that level of awareness for signals of fear depends on mode of functional connectivity in amygdala pathways rather than discrete patterns of activation in these pathways .

16957082|Awareness for fear relied on negative connectivity within both cortical and subcortical pathways to the amygdala , suggesting that reentrant feedback may be necessary to afford such awareness .

16957082|In contrast , responses to fear in the absence of awareness were supported by positive connections in a direct subcortical pathway to the amygdala , consistent with the view that excitatory feedforward connections along this pathway may be sufficient for automatic responses to '' unseen '' fear .

16952466|Thus , facial emotions signaling a potential threat , e.g. , fear or anger , should be perceived rapidly and automatically , possibly through a subcortical processing route which includes the amygdala .

16950220|This positron emission tomography -LRB- PET -RRB- study evaluated how the activity in the SP-NK1 receptor system in the amygdala was affected by fear provocation in subjects with specific phobia .

16946366|The ability to recognise fear is impaired in people with damage to the amygdala and , interestingly , in adult psychopathy .

16942837|During fear perception , age was significantly positively correlated with greater functional activity within the prefrontal cortex , whereas no significant relationship was evident between age and activity in the amygdala .

16931547|This is the first report demonstrating the presence of functional nAChR-mediated current responses from rat amygdala slices , where they may be playing a significant role in fear and aversively motivated memory .

16930417|The neural substrates of fear conditioning in rats have been well characterized , with converging lines of evidence indicating that conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- and unconditioned stimulus -LRB- US -RRB- information form a CS-US association in the amygdala .

16930415|Previous studies have strongly suggested that the dorsal subnucleus of the lateral amygdala is an important site of physiological plasticity in Pavlovian fear conditioning .

16930415|In the present study , we examined the effect of auditory fear conditioning on dendritic spine numbers in the dorsal subnucleus of the lateral amygdala using an immunolabelling procedure to visualize the spine-associated protein spinophilin .

16922878|These results indicate that proper development of the right amygdala is necessary for optimal fear recognition , with other neural processes unable to compensate for early amygdalar damage .

16919687|Long-term potentiation in the amygdala : a cellular mechanism of fear learning and memory . .

16919687|We first review the evidence suggesting that fear conditioning is mediated by changes in synaptic strength at sensory inputs to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala .

16919525|Given the phenomenological parallels between fear conditioning and the pathogenesis of PTSD , we have proposed that PTSD is characterized by exaggerated amygdala responses -LRB- subserving exaggerated acquisition of fear associations and expression of fear responses -RRB- and deficient frontal cortical function -LRB- mediating deficits in extinction and the capacity to suppress attention/response to trauma-related stimuli -RRB- , as well as deficient hippocampal function -LRB- mediating deficits in appreciation of safe contexts and explicit learning/memory -RRB- .

16919522|The role of the amygdala in the extinction of conditioned fear . .

16919522|The amygdala has long been known to play a central role in the acquisition and expression of fear .

16919522|More recently , convergent evidence has implicated the amygdala in the extinction of fear as well .

16897598|On the other hand , the expression of conditioned fear is positively related to amygdala BDNF and NGF levels , and to dorsal hippocampal NGF levels .

16895832|The amygdala plays a critical role in generating the emotion of fear , and alterations in amygdala fear processing are thought to underlie the acquisition and maintenance of anxiety disorders .

16893283|The authors discuss these findings in relation to the role of the amygdala in the establishment of social rank and the regulation of aggression and fear .

16891611|Noradrenergic signaling in the amygdala contributes to the reconsolidation of fear memory : treatment implications for PTSD . .

16891611|The lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is critical for fear learning .

16882859|Here we show that retrieved contextual fear memory is vulnerable to amnesic treatments and that the amygdala is critically involved .

16882022|Extinction of auditory fear conditioning requires MAPK/ERK activation in the basolateral amygdala . .

16882022|Based on experiments using the fear-potentiated startle paradigm suggesting a role for neuronal plasticity in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- during fear extinction , we directly addressed whether MAPK/ERK signalling in the basolateral amygdala is necessary for the acquisition of fear extinction using conditioned freezing as a read-out .

16882021|Extinction is not a sufficient condition to prevent fear memories from undergoing reconsolidation in the basolateral amygdala . .

16882021|We investigated whether such an interaction also exists between extinction and reconsolidation of fear memories within the amygdala , by using a within subjects experimental design .

16882021|We found that inhibition of protein synthesis in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- impaired reconsolidation for both the briefly reactivated and extinguished fear memories suggesting that extinction is not a sufficient condition to prevent induction of reconsolidation in the amygdala .

16882021|Therefore , under these conditions , extinction is not a boundary condition on reconsolidation of fear memories in the basolateral amygdala .

16880223|According to responses on Izard scales , electrical stimulations of the right amygdala induced negative emotions , especially fear and sadness .

16880223|In contrast , stimulations of the left amygdala were able to induce either pleasant -LRB- happiness -RRB- or unpleasant -LRB- fear , anxiety , sadness -RRB- emotions .

16879790|Particular attention is given to evidence pointing to conceptual and operational limitations of self-report scales purported to measure trait BI in adults , and especially to inconsistent correlations between such behavioral inhibition system -LRB- BIS -RRB- scores and amygdala and autonomic responses to fear - or startle-inducing stimuli .

16855007|The results show that the imagination of pain is associated with increased activity in several brain regions involved in the pain-related neural network , notably the anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , right anterior insula , cerebellum , posterior parietal cortex , and secondary somatosensory cortex region , whereas increased activity in the ACC and amygdala is associated with the viewing of images evoking fear .

16847305|To test this hypothesis , we tested cocaine-treated rats in a fear conditioning , inflation , and extinction task , known to depend on medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala .

16840932|Many laboratory studies on physiological alterations of amygdala in rats show that kindling interferes with the acquisition of fear conditioning .

16836634|Short latency responses may be important in priming the auditory cortex to prepare it for rapid analysis and in recruiting the amygdala for rapid emotional responses such as fear .

16829957|Over-riding maternal suppression of corticosterone through intra-amygdala corticosterone infusions permits fear conditioning and amygdala activation .

16822538|Alterations in fear conditioning and amygdalar activation following chronic wheel running in rats . .

16822538|Several convergent lines of evidence point to the amygdala as a key site of plasticity underlying most forms of fear conditioning .

16822538|The ability of chronic wheel running -LRB- WR -RRB- to alter both behavioral correlates of fear conditioning and indices of amygdalar activation , however , has not been simultaneously assessed .

16822538|These data demonstrate the ability of chronic physical activity to alter contextual fear conditioning and implicate the amygdala as a potential site of plasticity underlying this phenomenon .

16820029|Dynamic amino acid increases in the basolateral amygdala during acquisition and expression of conditioned fear . .

16820029|Glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid -LRB- GABA -RRB- release in the amygdala are thought to be crucial for the acquisition and expression of fear memories , but the time course of amino acid changes during conditioning is unknown .

16820029|Expression of conditioned fear to either a white noise or the context previously paired with shock produced similar rapid and transient increases in many amino acids in the amygdala .

16820029|These experiments demonstrate glutamate and GABA levels in the amygdala are differentially modulated during auditory and contextual fear learning , and are transiently increased during the expression of fear memories .

16819997|This functional dissociation has been particularly apparent in pavlovian fear conditioning , where the integrity of the hippocampus is necessary for contextual conditioning , and of the amygdala for discrete cue conditioning .

16819996|Here we investigated whether or not CaMKIINalpha and CaMKIINbeta gene expressions are regulated in the mouse hippocampus and amygdala after background contextual fear conditioning .

16819990|The ILc , together with the amygdala , bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and lateral hypothalamus , is involved in the regulation of fear behavior .

16819521|Generalization of amygdala LTP and conditioned fear in the absence of presynaptic inhibition . .

16819521|Pavlovian fear conditioning , a simple form of associative learning , is thought to involve the induction of associative , NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- in the lateral amygdala .

16814818|The present work focuses on fear perception and its relationship to the paranoid symptoms of schizophrenia , specifically , how underlying limbic system structures -LRB- i.e. the amygdala -RRB- react when probed with dynamic fearful facial expressions .

16810397|It is possible that amygdaloid 5-HT -LRB- 2a/2c -RRB- receptors may increase aggressive behavior in lactating females as a result of changes in fear .

16806522|In the last years , the role played by the medial nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- MeA -RRB- in the modulation of fear - and anxiety-related behaviors has been increasingly investigated .

16806315|Quantifying deficits in the perception of fear and anger in morphed facial expressions after bilateral amygdala damage . .

16806315|These results imply that when heuristics use is discouraged on tasks utilizing subtle emotion transitions , deficits in the perception of anger and anger/fear blends , as well as fear , are evident with bilateral amygdala damage .

16802333|The central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- orchestrates autonomic and other behavioral and physiological responses to conditioned stimuli that are aversive or elicit fear .

16793881|Dual circuitry for odor-shock conditioning during infancy : corticosterone switches between fear and attraction via amygdala . .

16793881|These results suggest corticosterone is important in sensitive-period termination and developmental emergence of olfactory fear conditioning , acting via the amygdala as a switch between fear and attraction .

16768614|Conditioned and unconditioned fear organized in the inferior colliculus are differentially sensitive to injections of muscimol into the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala . .

16735472|Also , compared with controls , patients had greater activation in the left amygdala , accumbens , putamen , and ventral prefrontal cortex when rating face hostility , and greater activation in the left amygdala and bilateral accumbens when rating their fear of the face .

16721035|Inhibition of CRH expression in amygdala suggests that the stress inflicted is of physical but not of psychological nature and could lead to reduced fear or anxiety .

16713119|The effects of corticotrophin-releasing factor administration to the serotonin cell body regions of the dorsal raphe nucleus on fear behavior , behavioral activity , and extracellular serotonin levels were assessed in freely moving rats with microdialysis probes implanted into the central nucleus of the amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex .

16710293|NR2B tyrosine phosphorylation modulates fear learning as well as amygdaloid synaptic plasticity . .

16710293|Here , we generate mice with a knockin mutation of the Tyr-1472 site to phenylalanine -LRB- Y1472F -RRB- and show that Tyr-1472 phosphorylation is essential for fear learning and amygdaloid synaptic plasticity .

16710293|We thus identify Tyr-1472 phosphorylation as a key mediator of fear learning and amygdaloid synaptic plasticity .

16705137|Here we show that bilateral infusion of CB1 receptor agonists into the amygdala after memory reactivation blocked reconsolidation of fear memory measured with fear-potentiated startle .

16697979|NPW-ir fibers were most abundantly observed in the central amygdaloid nucleus and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis , which are regions implicated in fear and anxiety .

16686646|The lateral nucleus of the amygdala is critical for fear conditioning , a paradigm of emotional learning , which requires recognition of an unconditioned stimulus as aversive and association of conditioned stimuli with an unconditioned stimulus .

16686646|We studied whether contextual or tone-cued fear conditioning is impaired in two status epilepticus models of epilepsy and whether impairment correlates with the extent of damage in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala .

16679778|Auditory fear conditioning and conditioned stress raise NO -LRB- 3 -RRB- level in the Amygdala . .

16679778|The conditioned fear response is considered to be acquired by experimental animals when tone information is combined with that of an electrical foot shock -LRB- unconditioned stimulus -RRB- in the amygdala .

16651009|This study investigates the effect of awareness of stimulus contingencies on BOLD responses within the amygdala , the orbitofrontal , and the occipital cortex , and on differential skin conductance responses -LRB- SCRs -RRB- during fear conditioning .

16630730|Basolateral amygdala noradrenergic activity mediates corticosterone-induced enhancement of auditory fear conditioning . .

16630730|The present experiment examined whether posttraining noradrenergic activity within the basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is required for mediating the facilitating effects of acutely administered glucocorticoids on memory for auditory-cue classical fear conditioning .

16626845|Fear conditioning also led to increased cFos expression in various areas central to fear processing , including the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala , the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and the anterior cingulate .

16624666|Evidence has demonstrated that the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is particularly associated with defensive behavior that involves the emotional states of fear and anxiety .

16623842|Long-term stability of fear memory depends on the synthesis of protein but not mRNA in the amygdala . .

16623842|In the present set of experiments , rats were given inhibitors of protein or messenger ribonucleic acid -LRB- mRNA -RRB- synthesis into the amygdala just after training or retrieval of fear memory .

16623831|In conclusion , cyclic estradiol administration reversed chronic stress-induced sensitization in the limbic system , the paraventricular nucleus and central amygdala of female rats , output regions of the limbic system involved in fear responses .

16616731|Control of fear extinction by physical context involves interactions between the dorsal hippocampus and the lateral nucleus of the amygdala .

16580757|The amygdala is integral to anxiety , fear , and related psychiatric diseases .

16580153|Lack of cortical input to the amygdala impairs the perpetrator 's ability to extinguish anxiety and/or conditioned fear and gives rise to either innate behaviors -LRB- e.g. , fight , flight , and shut down -RRB- or learned fear avoidant behaviors designed to avoid anxiety -LRB- e.g. , alcohol consumption , self-injurious acts , and obsessive behaviors -RRB- .

16572000|Considering the primordial role of the amygdala in simple associative learning -LRB- e.g. in cue-induced fear -RRB- and the role of the hippocampus in learning more complex stimulus relationships -LRB- e.g. in contextual fear -RRB- , the present and earlier findings are not necessarily contradictory , but suggest that cannabinoid signaling plays different roles in the two structures .

16563589|The author critically reviews the neuroevolutionary literature on stress-induced and fear circuitry disorders and related amygdala-driven , species-atypical fear behaviors of clinical severity in adult humans .

16547510|Here we show that fear conditioning in rats leads to the movement of profilin , an actin polymerization-regulatory protein , into dendritic spines in the lateral amygdala and that these spines undergo enlargements in their postsynaptic densities -LRB- PSDs -RRB- .

16547510|A greater proportion of profilin-containing spines with enlarged PSDs could contribute to the enhancement of associatively induced synaptic responses in the lateral amygdala following fear learning .

16547164|Differential transcriptional response to nonassociative and associative components of classical fear conditioning in the amygdala and hippocampus . .

16547164|We used Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays to characterize changes in gene expression compared to naive mice in both the amygdala and the hippocampus 30 min after classical fear conditioning and 30 min after exposure to the CS in the absence of an aversive stimulus .

16547164|We found that in the hippocampus , levels of gene regulation induced by classical fear conditioning were not significantly greater than those induced by CS alone , whereas in the amygdala , classical fear conditioning did induce significantly greater levels of gene regulation compared to the CS .

16547164|Our results demonstrate that an increase in gene regulation in the amygdala was partially correlated to associative learning and partially correlated to nonassociative components of the task , while gene regulation in the hippocampus was correlated to nonassociative components of classical fear conditioning , including configural learning .

16545468|The amygdala is a heterogeneous structure that has been implicated in a wide variety of functions , most notably in fear conditioning .

16525077|Possible mechanisms for acquired extroversion in bitemporal FTD include bilateral amygdalar damage with decreased interpersonal fear or sense of threat , orbitofrontal-ventromedial damage with social disinhibition , and relative sparing of dorsolateral frontal and anterior cingulate regions with preserved interpersonal agency .

16515842|Myosin light chain kinase regulates synaptic plasticity and fear learning in the lateral amygdala . .

16515842|We therefore examined whether the cytoskeletal-regulatory protein , myosin light chain kinase , might contribute to fear learning in the rat lateral amygdala .

16515842|Microinjection of ML-7 , a specific inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase , into the lateral nucleus of the amygdala before fear conditioning , but not immediately afterward , enhanced both short-term memory and long-term memory , suggesting that myosin light chain kinase is involved specifically in memory acquisition rather than in posttraining consolidation of memory .

16515842|Anatomical studies showed that myosin light chain kinase is present in cells throughout lateral nucleus of the amygdala and is localized to dendritic shafts and spines that are postsynaptic to the projections from the auditory thalamus to lateral nucleus of the amygdala , a pathway specifically implicated in fear learning .

16515842|Thus , myosin light chain kinase activity in lateral nucleus of the amygdala appears to normally suppress synaptic plasticity in the circuits underlying fear learning , suggesting that myosin light chain kinase may help prevent the acquisition of irrelevant fears .

16500019|Animal studies of amygdala function in fear and uncertainty : relevance to human research . .

16500019|This article reviews research in both animals and humans on the considerable progress made in elucidating a brain circuitry of fear , particularly the importance of the amygdala in fear conditioning .

16500019|While there is considerable agreement about the participation of the amygdala in fear in both animals and humans , there are several issues about the function of the amygdala raised by the human research that have not been addressed by or may be answered by animal research .

16500019|Three of these are addressed in this article : -LRB- 1 -RRB- is the amygdala involved in or necessary for both fear learning and unconditioned fear ?

16500019|-LRB- 2 -RRB- Does the amygdala code for intensity of fear ?

16500019|-LRB- 3 -RRB- Is the amygdala preferentially involved in fear , or is it also activated when there are no overt fear or aversive stimuli , but where the situation can be described as uncertain ?

16500019|We present evidence indicating that the rodent amygdala is involved in some types of fear -LRB- conditioned fear -RRB- , but not all types -LRB- unconditioned fear -RRB- , and may therefore have significance for a differential neurobiology of certain anxiety disorders in humans .

16500019|We conclude that progress on elucidating the role of the amygdala in fear is facilitated by corroboration of findings from both animal and human research .

16494851|Investigating the effect of bilateral amygdala lesions on fear conditioning and social interaction in the male Mongolian gerbil . .

16490415|It is well established that extinction is a form of new learning as opposed to forgetting or '' unlearning '' of conditioned fear , and it is hypothesized that extinction develops when sensory pathways conveying sensory information to the amygdala come to engage GABAergic interneurons through forms of experience-dependent plasticity such as long-term potentiation .

16487156|Enhancement of conditioned fear extinction by infusion of the GABA -LRB- A -RRB- agonist muscimol into the rat prefrontal cortex and amygdala . .

16487156|The involvement of GABA -LRB- A -RRB- receptors in fear extinction in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala is of particular interest , because of the role of these areas in emotional processes , and the role of the GABA -LRB- A -RRB- receptors in anxiety states .

16472906|Research across species concur that the neural correlates of fear conditioning include involvement of the amygdala during all stages of fear learning , and prefrontal areas during the extinction phase .

16460727|5-HT1A receptor agonist affects fear conditioning through stimulations of the postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in the hippocampus and amygdala . .

16460727|In the present study , we investigated the effects of bilateral microinjections of flesinoxan , a selective 5-HT -LRB- 1A -RRB- receptor agonist , into the hippocampus , amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex on the expression of contextual conditioned freezing and the defecation induced by conditioned fear stress in rats .

16460727|These results suggest that flesinoxan exerts its anxiolytic actions in the fear conditioning through stimulations of the postsynaptic 5-HT -LRB- 1A -RRB- receptors in the hippocampus and amygdala .

16458544|Evidence from previous studies indicates that the noradrenergic and GABAergic influences within the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- modulate the consolidation of memory for fear conditioning .

16452685|These results support the hypothesis that the amygdala modulates contextual fear memory by regulating expression of IEGs in the hippocampus .

16432299|The amygdala is widely recognized as a brain center critical for basic forms of emotional learning -LRB- e.g. , fear conditioning -RRB- and its structure in amphibians could suggest how this capacity evolved .

16430981|The elicitation of the defence response by a brain fear system , in which the amygdala is a key structure , is also discussed .

16420429|Hitting Ras where it counts : Ras antagonism in the basolateral amygdala inhibits long-term fear memory . .

16420429|RasGRF1 knockout mice show significant deficits in acquisition of long-term fear memories and long-term potentaition -LRB- LTP -RRB- in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

16420429|MAPK kinase inhibition also impairs fear conditioning and amygdaloid LTP .

16420429|Collectively , these results provide further evidence for the involvement of amygdaloid Ras in the acquisition of long-term conditional fear memory .

16407893|Using immunohistochemistry , the expression of a powerful anxiolytic molecule neuropeptide Y -LRB- NPY -RRB- was determined on postnatal day -LRB- PN -RRB- 20 in the hippocampus and basolateral amygdala -LRB- structures related to anxiety and fear -RRB- of the offspring .

16406707|Long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- at input synapses to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is a candidate mechanism for memory storage during fear learning .

16402133|The neuropeptide substance P -LRB- SP -RRB- , encoded by the preprotachykinin-A -LRB- PPTA -RRB- gene , is expressed in the central and medial amygdaloid nucleus , where it plays a critical role in modulating fear and anxiety related behaviour .

16399692|The role of the amygdala and olfaction in unconditioned fear in developing rats . .

16399692|Different nuclei of the amygdala mediate unconditioned and conditioned fear responses to threat in adult rats .

16399692|The aim of this study was to determine the role of the amygdala in unlearned fear behavior in young rats .

16399692|These findings indicate that different nuclei of the amygdala process sensory information of different modalities , mediate unconditioned freezing , and may be involved in developmental changes in the fear response in young rats .

16351838|The amygdala is considered a core structure of the so-called limbic system and has been implicated in a variety of functions , including emotional interpretation of sensory information , emotional arousal , emotional memory , fear and anxiety , and related clinical disorders .

16351838|Despite the clinical and functional importance of the amygdala , it is only recently that some general principles of intra-amygdaloid mechanisms of signal processing that are relevant for fear behavior and memory have emerged from behavioral , anatomical , electrophysiological , and neurochemical studies performed in the amygdala of various mammalian species in vivo , in situ and in vitro .

16339042|Recently , oxytocin administration in humans was shown to increase trust , suggesting involvement of the amygdala , a central component of the neurocircuitry of fear and social cognition that has been linked to trust and highly expresses oxytocin receptors in many mammals .

16339042|Compared with placebo , oxytocin potently reduced activation of the amygdala and reduced coupling of the amygdala to brainstem regions implicated in autonomic and behavioral manifestations of fear .

16319311|The present findings support a two-levels-of-learning account of human fear conditioning and also demonstrate that the amygdala is crucially involved in fear learning .

16300433|Neural activity in central and basolateral amygdala nuclei -LRB- CeA and BLA , respectively -RRB- was recorded during delay eyeblink conditioning , Pavlovian fear conditioning , and signaled barpress avoidance .

16289581|Although the cellular mechanisms in the amygdala that underlie fear learning have received considerable attention relatively little is known about the neural substrates underlying unconditioned stimulus-associated fear .

16289581|We concluded that fear arousal provoked by footshock is not mediated by glutamate neurotransmission in the amygdala and does not involve de novo protein synthesis .

16289581|The muscimol results were interpreted to suggest that decreased GABA neurotransmission in the amygdala may be essential for the neural causation of fear that is acquired and expressed by conditioned stimuli .

16286816|The amygdala is an important brain site in the modulation of fear or anxiety .

16286011|stathmin , a gene enriched in the amygdala , controls both learned and innate fear . .

16286011|We have identified stathmin , an inhibitor of microtubule formation , as highly expressed in the lateral nucleus -LRB- LA -RRB- of the amygdala as well as in the thalamic and cortical structures that send information to the LA about the conditioned -LRB- learned fear -RRB- and unconditioned stimuli -LRB- innate fear -RRB- .

16286011|The knockout mice also exhibit decreased memory in amygdala-dependent fear conditioning and fail to recognize danger in innately aversive environments .

16286011|We therefore conclude that stathmin is required for the induction of LTP in afferent inputs to the amygdala and is essential in regulating both innate and learned fear .

16281289|We used functional neuroimaging to establish whether the amygdala and the medial prefrontal regions to which it projects are engaged by subliminal fearful faces and whether responses to subliminal fear are distinguished from those to supraliminal fear .

16281289|We also examined the time course of amygdala-medial prefrontal responses to supraliminal and subliminal fear .

16281289|SCRs and amygdala activity were enhanced in response to both subliminal and supraliminal fear perception .

16281289|Time series analysis showed a trend toward greater right amygdala responses to subliminal fear , but left-sided responses to supraliminal fear .

16281289|Although subcortical amygdala activity was relatively persistent for subliminal fear , supraliminal fear showed more sustained cortical activity .

16281289|The findings suggest that preverbal processing of fear may occur via a direct rostral-ventral amygdala pathway without the need for conscious surveillance , whereas elaboration of consciously attended signals of fear may rely on higher-order processing within a dorsal cortico-amygdala pathway .

16262672|Although recent work implicates the amygdala and orbital prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFo -RRB- in extinction of Pavlovian conditioned fear and aversion , much less is known about the neural bases of instrumental extinction .

16251449|Tracking the fear engram : the lateral amygdala is an essential locus of fear memory storage . .

16251449|Here , we combine site-specific behavioral pharmacology with multisite electrophysiological recording techniques to show that the lateral nucleus of the amygdala , long thought to be critical for the acquisition of fear memories , is also an essential locus of fear memory storage .

16242399|Research on the neural systems underlying emotion in animal models over the past two decades has implicated the amygdala in fear and other emotional processes .

16237391|Deletion of mGluR7 reduces also amygdala - and hippocampus-dependent conditioned fear and aversion responses .

16237172|Lesions of the basal amygdala block expression of conditioned fear but not extinction . .

16237172|Although the role of the amygdala in acquisition of conditioned fear is well established , there is debate concerning the intra-amygdala circuits involved .

16237172|The lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is thought to be an essential site of plasticity in fear conditioning .

16237172|The LA has both direct and indirect -LSB- via the basal nuclei ; basal amygdala -LRB- BA -RRB- -RSB- projections to the central nucleus -LRB- Ce -RRB- of the amygdala , an essential output for fear behaviors .

16222981|-LSB- Beta-adrenoceptors in amygdala are involved in conditioned fear memory -RSB- . .

16219906|Synaptic expression of glutamate receptor after encoding of fear memory in the rat amygdala . .

16219906|Here , by labeling surface receptors with biotin or using membrane fractionation approaches , we report that fear conditioning resulted in an increase in surface expression of GluR1 subunit of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors in the amygdala , whereas total GluR1 mRNA and protein levels were unchanged .

16216534|Trauma modulates amygdala and medial prefrontal responses to consciously attended fear . .

16216534|Effective fear processing relies on the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- MPFC -RRB- .

16216534|Post-traumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- has been associated with excessive amygdala and a lack of MPFC activity in response to nonconscious facial signals of fear , but responses to consciously processed facial fear stimuli have not been examined .

16216534|We used functional MRI to elucidate the effect of trauma reactions on amygdala-MPFC function during an overt fear perception task .

16213603|Temporary inactivation of the medial and basolateral amygdala differentially affects TMT-induced fear behavior in rats . .

16213603|In contrast , the central and lateral nuclei of the amygdala does not seem to participate in the neural processing of TMT-induced fear .

16213603|These results clearly demonstrate that the medial amygdala is crucial for TMT-induced freezing , whereas the basolateral amygdala seems to play a modulatory role in this type of fear behavior .

16213603|Since the medial amygdala is also involved in the processing of cat odor-induced fear , the finding of the present study points towards a general role of the medial amygdala in the processing of predator odor-induced fear .

16205786|All results suggested that amygdaloid glucocorticoid receptors were involved in the extinction of conditioned fear .

16204200|These results also suggest that the amygdala modulates the storage of the context fear memory and may do so by influencing the storage of the representation of the context in which the shock occurred .

16203979|The amygdala is centrally involved in formation of emotional memory and response to fear or risk .

16198609|Conditioned and unconditioned fear organized in the periaqueductal gray are differentially sensitive to injections of muscimol into amygdaloid nuclei . .

16198609|The contextual conditioned freezing behavior is generated in the neural circuits of conditioned fear in the amygdala .

16197518|In the maintenance phase of fear memory , synaptic transmission is potentiated and the stimulus requirements and signalling mechanisms are altered for long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- in the cortico-lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- pathway .

16197518|These findings link amygdala synaptic plasticity to the coding of fear memories .

16197518|Behavioural experiments suggest that the amygdala serves to store long-term fear memories .

16197518|We show that synaptic transmission was facilitated and that high-frequency stimulation dependent LTP -LRB- HFS-LTP -RRB- of the cortico-lateral amygdala pathway remained attenuated 10 days following fear conditioning .

16197518|The persistent facilitation of synaptic transmission and occlusion of HFS-LTP suggests that , unlike hippocampal coding of contextual fear memory , the cortico-lateral amygdala synapse is involved in the storage of long-term fear memories .

16197518|However , the absence of LFS-LTP 10 days following fear conditioning suggests that amygdala physiology 1 day following fear learning may reflect a dynamic state during memory stabilization that is inactive during the long-term storage of fear memory .

16189475|During fear perception , amygdala activity positively correlated with several social dimensions of anxiety , including peer rejection , humiliation , performing in public , and being separated from loved ones , but was not correlated with most measured nonsocial dimensions of anxiety .

16188284|Both , acquisition and expression of conditioned fear were dose-dependently inhibited by -LRB- S -RRB- -3,4 - DCPG injections into the amygdala .

16188284|Since synaptic long-term potentiation in the lateral amygdala has been correlated with the acquisition of conditioned fear in rats , the effect of -LRB- S -RRB- -3,4 - DCPG in vitro on synaptic transmission , short - and long-term plasticity in the lateral amygdala was evaluated in parallel .

16188284|We conclude that mGluR8 activation is not specifically involved in long-term plasticity processes but that it rather provides a powerful inhibitory control of synaptic transmission within the lateral amygdala , with the ability to reduce activity in such a way that the expression and the acquisition of learned fear become strongly impaired in vivo .

16185722|The lateral , basal , and central nuclei of the amygdala are part of a circuitry that instantiates many fear and anxious behaviors .

16185722|Other research finds that anxiogenic drugs working through various mechanisms induce IEG expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- suggesting that expression is a neural marker for fear and anxiety .

16182456|Though both the amygdala and the serotonin system appear to play critical roles in regulating fear and anxiety , little is known regarding the organization of serotonergic inputs to the primate amygdala .

16181741|In lateral amygdala , glucocorticoid receptors are thus also localized to non-nuclear-membrane translocation sites , particularly dendritic spines , where they show an affinity for postsynaptic membrane densities , and may have a specialized role in modulating synaptic transmission plasticity related to fear and emotional memory .

16177042|Previous stress facilitates fear memory , attenuates GABAergic inhibition , and increases synaptic plasticity in the rat basolateral amygdala . .

16176889|This study examined whether patients with temporal lobe epilepsy -LRB- TLE -RRB- and ictal fear -LRB- IF -RRB- show emotion recognition deficits similar to those associated with amygdala damage .

16167091|The present study utilized a fear potentiated startle paradigm to examine amygdala function in individuals with autism spectrum disorder .

16167091|Two competing hypotheses regarding amygdala dysfunction in autism have been proposed : -LRB- 1 -RRB- The amygdala is under-responsive , in which case it would be predicted that , in a fear potentiated startle experiment , individuals with autism would exhibit decreased fear conditioning and/or potentiation , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- The amygdala is over responsive , in which case an exaggerated potentiation of the startle response would be predicted .

16167091|These results suggest that this aspect of amygdala function , namely fear conditioning and potentiation of the startle response , is intact in individuals with autism .

16165099|Neuroanatomical data point to functional relationships between the anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- and subcortical centers regulating fear , in particular , the amygdala .

16158424|Theta activity in neurons and networks of the amygdala related to long-term fear memory . .

16158424|With a combined in vitro/in vivo electrophysiological and behavioral approach , we have correlated conditioned fear behavior to electrophysiological activities in the lateral amygdala and the hippocampal formation in rodents .

16157273|Recent work in the amygdala reveals that LTP and Pavlovian fear conditioning induce similar changes in postsynaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptors and that occluding these changes by viral-mediated overexpression of a dominant-negative GluR1 construct attenuates both LTP and fear memory in rats .

16155058|These negative findings are discussed in relation to -LRB- 1 -RRB- previous data showing specific impairment in autism in recognizing the belief-based expression of surprise , -LRB- 2 -RRB- previous data showing specific impairment in autism in recognizing fear , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- the convergence of findings that individuals with autism , like patients with amygdala damage , pass a basic emotions recognition test but fail to recognize more complex stimuli involving the perception of faces or part of faces .

16143545|Although the amygdala has been described as a '' fear module '' , a growing body of work suggests that it is a more general '' relevance detector . ''

16140156|Distinct gene expression profiles in hippocampus and amygdala after fear conditioning . .

16140156|It is well known that the hippocampus and amygdala are involved in the formations of fear conditioning memories , and both contextual and cued fear memory requires activation of the NMDA receptors .

16140156|Therefore , our study suggests that different genomic responses are initiated in the hippocampus and amygdala which are known to play distinct roles in fear memory formation .

16123750|The amygdala is involved in behavioral and physiological responses to fear , and the anxiolytic properties of several drugs are localized to this region .

16120461|Converging lines of evidence indicate that the amygdala is necessarily involved in the acquisition , storage and expression of conditioned fear memory , and long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala is often proposed as the underlying synaptic mechanism of associative fear memory .

16120461|Despite these advances , there are unresolved issues and findings that challenge the validity and sufficiency of the current amygdalar LTP hypothesis of fear conditioning .

16120461|The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of evidence indicating that fear conditioning depend crucially upon the amygdalar circuit and plasticity .

16108061|Peptides of love and fear : vasopressin and oxytocin modulate the integration of information in the amygdala . .

16108061|Animal and human studies indicate the major role of the amygdala in controlling fear and anxiety .

16108061|This is accomplished by projections connecting the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- to the brain stem and to hypothalamic structures , which organize fear responses .

16107281|Glucocorticoid receptor antagonism in the basolateral amygdala and ventral hippocampus interferes with long-term memory of contextual fear . .

16107281|The GR antagonist RU 38486 was administered peripherally -LRB- 10 , 20 , or 30 mg/kg/ml -RRB- , as well as centrally into the lateral ventricle -LRB- 75 or 150 ng/2 microL -RRB- , basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA ; 0.3 , 3 , or 30 ng/0 .2 microL -RRB- , dorsal hippocampus -LRB- DH ; 30 ng/microL -RRB- or ventral hippocampus -LRB- VH ; 30 ng/microL -RRB- prior to contextual fear conditioning .

16095694|A review of the brain regions involved in predator odor-induced fear behavior indicates a modulatory role of the medial amygdala , bed nucleus of the stria terminalis , and dorsal premammillary nucleus .

16095694|In addition , the basolateral amygdala is involved in fear behavior induced by cat odor but not TMT , and the central amygdala does not appear to play a major behavioral role in predator odor-induced fear .

16093394|Extinction normally depends on a new learning that competes with the original fear memory and is driven by medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- projections to the amygdala .

16093394|Although mPFC stimulation was reported to inhibit the central medial -LRB- CEm -RRB- amygdala neurons that mediate fear responses via their brainstem and hypothalamic projections , it is unclear how this inhibition is generated .

16093389|A similar decrease in LTP was found in the lateral amygdala , another structure implicated in fear memory .

16085128|Several lesion and functional imaging studies conducted in animals and humans suggest that structures within the amygdaloid nuclear complex -LRB- ANC -RRB- are important for the occurrence of fear conditioning .

16083887|Estrogen facilitates fear conditioning and increases corticotropin-releasing hormone mRNA expression in the central amygdala in female mice . .

16083887|However , evidence suggests that estrogens may exert their influence on fear within the amygdala .

16083887|These data raise the possibility that estrogens could influence fear responses in females through their actions in the amygdala .

16081303|Distinct amygdala-autonomic arousal profiles in response to fear signals in healthy males and females . .

16081303|The amygdala has a key role in regulating arousal and vigilance , and responds to both visual and vocal signals of fear , including facial expressions of fear .

16081303|In this study , we used functional MRI to examine sex differences in the magnitude , extent , lateralization and time course of amygdala responses to facial signals of fear , in a relatively large sample of males and females .

16061519|In contrast , the amygdala and its role in Pavlovian fear conditioning promise to provide us with new insights into the mechanisms of BDNF-mediated synaptic plasticity during the learning and memory process .

16061519|The focus is primarily on the use of Pavlovian fear conditioning as a learning model that allows for the examination of the role of BDNF in the amygdala , following a single learning session and within a well-understood neural circuit .

16046064|The patient group rated the spider pictures as being more disgust and fear evoking than the control group , and showed greater activation of the visual association cortex , the amygdalae , the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the right hippocampus .

16038681|Neuroimaging studies report reduced medial prefrontal cortical -LRB- particularly anterior cingulate -RRB- but enhanced amygdala response to fear signals in posttraumatic Stress Disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- .

16034442|Bilateral administration of a TrkB ligand scavenger TrkB IgG and a Trk-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor K252a to the amygdala impaired fear memory , as measured with fear-potentiated startle .

16033935|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is a critical component of the amygdaloid circuit , which is thought to be involved in fear conditioned responses .

16029210|Memory consolidation of Pavlovian fear conditioning requires nitric oxide signaling in the lateral amygdala . .

16029210|We first show that neuronal nitric oxide synthase is localized in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- , a critical site of plasticity in fear conditioning .

16027178|A different recruitment of the lateral and basolateral amygdala promotes contextual or elemental conditioned association in Pavlovian fear conditioning . .

16027178|Convergent data suggest dissociated roles for the lateral -LRB- LA -RRB- and basolateral -LRB- BLA -RRB- amygdaloid nuclei in fear conditioning , depending on whether a discrete conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- - unconditional stimulus -LRB- US -RRB- or context-US association is considered .

16018978|Repeated ethanol exposure and withdrawal impairs human fear conditioning and depresses long-term potentiation in rat amygdala and hippocampus . .

16002228|The cornerstone hypothesis is that , before forgiveness takes place , memories periodically arouse fear stemming from the amygdala .

16002228|Under appropriate circumstances the frontal cortex interrupts the pattern and quells the fear response in the amygdala .

15997600|Animal studies have shown that the amygdala plays a critical role in acquisition of conditioned fear responses , while the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- including anterior cingulate -RRB- , through inhibition of amygdala responsiveness , has been hypothesized to play a role in extinction of fear responses .

15997600|PTSD patients had increased left amygdala activation with fear acquisition , and decreased anterior cingulate function during extinction , relative to controls .

15997600|These findings implicate amygdala and anterior cingulate in the acquisition and extinction of fear responses , respectively , in PTSD .

15997022|The healthy controls showed enhanced differential activation in the limbic-prefrontal circuit -LRB- amygdala , orbitofrontal cortex , insula , and anterior cingulate -RRB- during the acquisition of fear and successful verbal and autonomic conditioning .

15994724|Lack of appropriate top-down governance by frontal cortical regions over a hypersensitive amygdala-centered fear neurocircuitry has been hypothesized to be central in the pathophysiology of panic disorder .

15994019|In general , fear learning-associated structures , including hippocampus and amygdala , showed maximum expression before puberty , regardless of genotype .

15970222|Research has demonstrated that immediate-early genes/inducible transcriptional factors -LRB- e.g. , c-fos , egr-1 -RRB- are increased in amygdala nuclei -LRB- lateral , basal and central nuclei -RRB- known to be involved in fear conditioning , footshock stress and novelty .

15963650|The role of the amygdala in human fear : automatic detection of threat . .

15961053|The role of the human amygdala in the production of conditioned fear responses . .

15961053|The amygdala plays a central role in the acquisition and expression of fear memories .

15961053|Laboratory animal studies indicate that the amygdala both receives sensory information and produces learned behavioral and autonomic fear responses .

15961053|However , prior functional imaging research in humans has largely focused on amygdala activity elicited by fearful stimuli , giving less attention to this region 's role in the production of fear responses .

15961053|In contrast , the present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the amygdala 's influence on the generation of conditional fear responses .

15961053|These results suggest the amygdala not only responds to fearful stimuli , but also generates learning-related changes in human autonomic fear expression .

15958739|Auditory fear conditioning and long-term potentiation in the lateral amygdala require ERK/MAP kinase signaling in the auditory thalamus : a role for presynaptic plasticity in the fear system . .

15951121|Facilitation of conditioned fear extinction by d-cycloserine is mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase cascades and requires de novo protein synthesis in basolateral nucleus of amygdala . .

15951121|These results suggested that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent signaling cascades and new protein synthesis within the basolateral nucleus of amygdala played important roles in the d-cycloserine facilitation of the extinction of conditioned fear .

15947057|The amygdala is preferentially activated by facial expressions of fear .

15935259|Hemodynamic responses of the amygdala , the orbitofrontal cortex and the visual cortex during a fear conditioning paradigm . .

15931675|Thus , the present study adds novel evidence further supporting that the BNST and the central nucleus of the amygdala form part of an adrenal steroid-sensitive extrahypothalamic circuit that has been involved in fear and anxiety responses and in clinical syndromes such as melancholic depression , posttraumatic stress disorders , and addiction .

15931063|These results provided the first functional neuroimaging support in human patients for the neuroanatomical hypothesis of panic disorder focusing on the amygdala-based fear network .

15927407|The amygdala is a brain area which plays a decisive role in fear and anxiety .

15922053|The results showed that a long-context exposure prior to cued conditioning produces an inhibition of the CR -LRB- freezing -RRB- , and this phenomenon is related with a specific c-fos expression in CA1 , CA3 , BL Amygdala , LS and BNST during the fear acquisition .

15911871|Similar synaptic changes after fear conditioning are well documented in the amygdala and hippocampus , providing a link between emotional experiences and changes in neural activity .

15878802|The amygdala is critical for acquiring and expressing conditioned fear responses elicited by sensory stimuli that predict future punishment , but there is conflicting evidence about whether the amygdala is necessary for perceiving the aversive qualities of painful or noxious stimuli that inflict primary punishment .

15878802|These findings indicate that neural activity within the amygdala is important for both predicting and perceiving the aversive qualities of noxious stimuli , and that synaptic plasticity within LA is the mechanism by which the CS becomes associated with the US during fear conditioning .

15877308|The amygdala is an important target of stress and mediates physiological and behavioral responses associated with fear and strong emotions .

15869492|Recent animal studies have raised the possibility that cooperativity between amygdala and hippocampus contributes to the retrieval of fear memories .

15869487|The amygdala mediates both emotional learning and fear potentiation of startle .

15869487|The lateral amygdala nucleus -LRB- LA -RRB- receives auditory inputs from both the auditory thalamus -LRB- medial geniculate nucleus ; MGN -RRB- and auditory association cortex -LRB- AAC -RRB- , and is critical for auditory fear conditioning .

15862214|Pathways for fear perception : modulation of amygdala activity by thalamo-cortical systems . .

15862214|Effective perception of fear signals is crucial for human survival and the importance of the amygdala in this process is well documented .

15862214|Animal , lesion and neuroimaging studies indicate that incoming sensory signals of fear travel from thalamus to amygdala via two neural pathways : a direct subcortical route and an indirect pathway via the sensory cortex .

15862214|Psychophysiological interactions revealed an inverse functional connectivity between occipito-temporal visual regions and the left amygdala , but a positive connectivity between these visual region and the right amygdala , suggesting that there is a hemispheric specialization in the transfer of fear signals from sensory cortices to amygdala .

15857700|The interest of this observation comes from the fact that the central nucleus is the main output station of the amygdala for conditioned fear responses and evidence that the infralimbic cortex plays a critical role in the extinction of conditioned fear .

15857700|Thus , our findings raise the possibility that the infralimbic cortex inhibits conditioned fear via the excitation of intercalated cells and the consequent inhibition of central amygdala neurons .

15850729|Intraclass correlation coefficients calculated across the sessions indicated stability of response in left amygdala to fearful faces -LRB- as a change from baseline -RRB- , but considerably less left amygdala stability in responses to neutral expressions and for fear versus neutral contrasts .

15848808|Concurrent electrophysiological measurements identified a safety learning-induced long-lasting depression of CS-evoked activity in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala , consistent with fear reduction , and an increase of CS-evoked activity in a region of the striatum involved in positive affect , euphoric responses , and reward .

15843623|Unilateral storage of fear memories by the amygdala . .

15843623|In future studies , the cellular mechanisms of emotional memory storage might be pinpointed by identifying cellular processes that occur only in the amygdala contralateral but not ipsilateral from the US during lateralized fear conditioning .

15823161|In those five subjects , the rCBF in the right amygdala and the left posterior cingulate gyrus after acquisition of fear conditioning significantly increased relative to the rCBF before conditioning .

15817185|These results indicate that with few conditioning trials , both the BLA and CeN are required in a serial manner for conditioned fear responses , but that overtraining can mitigate such impairments , likely involving parallel pathways in and through the amygdala .

15814195|The amygdala is considered to be the area involved in acquisition , consolidation and recall of fear .

15814195|The present study was designed to continuously monitor changes in extracellular levels of glutamate , dopamine and serotonin in the amygdala , at the acquisition of conditioned fear on Day 1 and at fear recall in response to a tone as a conditioned stimulus on Day 2 , using the in vivo microdialysis method .

15813993|Auditory fear memory required the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- receptors in the amygdala .

15813642|First , SP and NK1R are expressed in brain regions that are involved in stress , fear and affective response -LRB- e.g. amygdala , hippocampus , hypothalamus and frontal cortex -RRB- .

15797028|Substantial evidence demonstrates that the amygdala contributes to the emotion of fear and the response to threat .

15791096|Anesthesia , amnesia , and the amygdala : reducing the fear of intraoperative awareness . .

15780462|Conversely , amygdala lesions did not affect place learning ; however , these animals were impaired in their suppression of the fear response following repeated unpaired trials .

15774945|Glutamate receptor antagonist infusions into the basolateral and medial amygdala reveal differential contributions to olfactory vs. context fear conditioning and expression . .

15774945|The basolateral amygdala 's involvement in fear acquisition and expression to visual and auditory stimuli is well known .

15774945|The involvement of the basolateral and other amygdala areas in fear acquisition and expression to stimuli of other modalities is less certain .

15774945|We evaluated the contribution of the basolateral and medial amygdala to olfactory and to context fear and fear conditioning by infusing into these areas the NMDA receptor antagonist AP5 , the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist NBQX , or vehicle prior to either odor-shock pairings or fear-potentiated startle testing .

15774945|Pre-training AP5 infusions into the basolateral amygdala disrupted fear conditioning to the odor but not the context conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- .

15774945|Neither compound blocked fear conditioning when infused into the medial amygdala prior to training , but pre-test NBQX infusions did block fear-potentiated startle .

15774945|The results confirm and extend recent findings suggesting a role for the basolateral amygdala in olfactory fear and fear conditioning , reveal an unexpected dissociation of the basolateral amygdala 's involvement in discrete cue versus context fear and fear conditioning , and implicate for the first time the medial amygdala in fear-potentiated startle .

15774944|There is a close correlation between long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- in the synapses of lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- and fear conditioning in animals .

15774944|Taken together , the present results characterize the properties of DCG-IV depotentiation and reveal a close parallel between depotentiation in the amygdala slice and the reduction of conditioned fear in animals .

15746389|Here we report that fear conditioning drives AMPA-type glutamate receptors into the synapse of a large fraction of postsynaptic neurons in the lateral amygdala , a brain structure essential for this learning process .

15744733|Mouse models of impaired fear memory exhibit deficits in amygdalar LTP . .

15744733|Strains with impaired contextual or cued fear memory may have selective LTP deficits in different hippocampal subregions , or in the amygdala .

15744733|Thus , reduced amygdalar LTP is correlated with impaired cued fear memory in strains A/J and BALB .

15744733|In this first conjoint study of amygdala-dependent memory and amygdalar LTP in inbred mice , we identified specific hippocampal and amygdalar LTP deficits that correlate with fear memory impairments .

15730874|This specific histaminergic modulation of neuronal activity in the amygdala may play an important role in amygdala-mediated physiological and pathophysiological processes , such as fear , emotional learning and memory , temporal lobe epilepsy , and affective disorders .

15727511|Impaired fear memories are correlated with subregion-specific deficits in hippocampal and amygdalar LTP . .

15727511|Strains with impaired fear memory may have selective LTP deficits in different hippocampal subregions or in the amygdala .

15727511|Contextual and cued fear memory , and SC and amygdalar LTP , were intact in B6 and 129 , but all were impaired in C3H and D2 .

15716421|Much evidence indicates that fear conditioning involves potentiation of some thalamic inputs to the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- .

15706235|While viewing the fear pictures , which depicted attacks by humans or animals , men exhibited greater activation in the bilateral amygdala and the left fusiform gyrus than women .

15699060|In comparison , the amygdala 's role in recognition of fear in non-musical contexts has been well established .

15695163|Consolidation of fear memory requires neural changes to occur in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , including modulation of histaminergic neurotransmission .

15677442|We hypothesized that infusion of a CRH -LRB- 1 -RRB- antagonist into the amygdala following social defeat would prevent the development of generalized fear responses .

15677442|These findings support a role for CRH in the amygdala to promote consolidation of emotional memory and indicate that antagonism of CRH -LRB- 1 -RRB- receptors in the amygdala may prevent the development of exaggerated fear responses in stressed mice .

15677441|Variations in maternal care over the first week of life alter the expression of genes encoding for various subunits of the GABA -LRB- A -RRB- / benzodiazepine -LRB- BZ -RRB- receptor in the amygdala , a brain region associated with fear behavior .

15677391|The amygdala mediates physiological and behavioral responses associated with fear .

15673443|It is well established that the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CEA -RRB- is involved in responses to stress , fear and anxiety .

15670706|Parallel amygdala and inferotemporal activation reflect emotional intensity and fear relevance . .

15669223|Recently it has been suggested that the combination of SSRI and benzodiazepine is rational , because each drug has a different mechanism of action , the benzodiazepine enhancing GABAergic transmission , the SSRIs stimulating the 5-HT1A receptor that may inhibit the postsynaptic neuronal excitability in the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex that comprise the brain circuit of fear and anxiety .

15669102|Hippocampal and amygdaloid neuroplasticity are important substrates for Pavlovian fear conditioning .

15669102|Preprocessing of long CS-US contingencies in the hippocampus appears to be important for the final information processing and execution of fear memories through amygdala circuits .

15664794|The findings of the present study are consistent with the hypothesis of decreased frontal-striatal control of limbic structures , specifically the amygdala , resulting in an inadequate fear response in OCD patients with contamination fear .

15659301|Emotions such as fear and anxiety are mediated by a neural network containing nuclei like the amygdala , the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the periaqueductal gray .

15659301|We suggest that there is rather a neurochemical than a neuroanatomical dissociation between learned fear and anxiety as hypothesized by Walker and Davis -LRB- Walker , D.L. and M. Davis , 1997b , Double dissociation between the involvement of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the central nucleus of the amygdala in startle increases produced by conditioned versus unconditioned fear , J. Neurosci .

15654867|Activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase - mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade in the amygdala is required for memory reconsolidation of auditory fear conditioning . .

15654867|Consolidation of new fear memories has been shown to require de novo RNA and protein synthesis in the lateral nucleus of amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- .

15647495|Regulation of gephyrin and GABAA receptor binding within the amygdala after fear acquisition and extinction . .

15647495|Both the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear appear to require the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- .

15644275|The LA has intra-amygdaloid connections with the central amygdala nucleus , which mediates auditory fear potentiation of startle -LRB- AFPS -RRB- via pathways to the startle circuits .

15635411|A mechanism for impaired fear recognition after amygdala damage . .

15635411|Ten years ago , we reported that SM , a patient with rare bilateral amygdala damage , showed an intriguing impairment in her ability to recognize fear from facial expressions .

15635411|Yet the mechanism by which amygdala damage compromises fear recognition has not been identified .

15635411|This finding provides a mechanism to explain the amygdala 's role in fear recognition , and points to new approaches for the possible rehabilitation of patients with defective emotion perception .

15632281|The review will focus on the fundamental role for synapses in the amygdala in acquiring fear memories and the function of neural circuits interconnecting the amygdala , hippocampus , and prefrontal cortex in modulating the expression of such memories once learned .

15632280|The amygdala , a sub-cortical nuclear group , is a brain structure critically important for fear conditioning .

15632280|Recent studies indicate that both fear conditioning-induced neuronal plasticity and LTP at the amygdala synapses share common mechanisms of induction and expression .

15621024|The input from the medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus -LRB- MGN -RRB- to the lateral amygdala is known to be important in the regulation of fear and anxiety .

15618889|Distinct response profiles were elicited for fear -LRB- enhanced arousal with amygdala activity -RRB- , anger -LRB- rapid onset , slow recovery arousal responses with anterior cingulate -RRB- and disgust -LRB- delayed arousal responses with insula and basal ganglia activity -RRB- .

15598549|Regression analyses demonstrated that state anxiety was correlated with activity in left amygdala , bilateral perirhinal cortex , right FG , and periaquaductal grey ; by contrast , phobic fear was only associated with right-sided hippocampal activity .

15598549|Analyses of covariance suggest a further functional segregation with state anxiety being linked to enhanced activity in amygdala , perirhinal cortex , and tegmentum , and phobic fear with enhanced right hippocampal activity , suggesting a neuroanatomical differentiation between emotional-vegetative and cognitive aspects of -LRB- phobic -RRB- fear .

15588615|We examined whether consciously undetected fear signals engage a collateral brainstem pathway to the amygdala and prefrontal cortex in the intact human brain , using functional neuroimaging .

15588615|` Blindsight ' lesion patients can respond to visual fear signals independently from conscious experience , suggesting that these signals reach the amygdala via a direct pathway that bypasses the primary visual cortex .

15588615|Results revealed that subliminal fear signals elicited activity in the brainstem region encompassing the superior colliculus and locus coeruleus , pulvinar and amygdala , and in fronto-temporal regions associated with orienting .

15588615|These findings suggest that crude sensory input from the superior colliculo-pulvinar visual pathway to the amygdala may allow for sufficient appraisal of fear signals to innervate the locus coeruleus .

15582224|A particular effort is made to understand how dopamine in the amygdala , medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens -- target structures of the mesolimbic dopamine system originating from the ventral tegmental area -- could relate to different aspects of fear conditioning .

15550348|The amygdala , a structure that plays a critical role in fear learning , is also an important target of anxiety and stress .

15550348|Repeated stress promotes behavioral changes that can be associated with these two brain structures such as impairment of hippocampus-dependent memory and enhancement of fear and aggression , which are likely to reflect amygdala function .

15537900|Finally , neither chronic P replacement nor acute THP affected fear-potentiated startle , suggesting that P metabolites have an effect on the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and anxiety rather than on the amygdala and stimulus-specific fear .

15537739|Olfactory fear conditioning induces field potential potentiation in rat olfactory cortex and amygdala . .

15537738|We found a selective increase in BDNF transcripts containing exons I and III in the amygdala 2 h following fear conditioning , while mRNA levels of BDNF exons II and IV remained unchanged .

15535167|Changes in metabolic activity within the amygdala and hippocampus support the involvement of these regions in each of the procedural phases of fear conditioning .

15535167|The present data show learning-related amygdala and hippocampal activity during human Pavlovian fear conditioning and suggest that the amygdala is particularly important for forming new associations as relationships between stimuli change .

15519685|These findings suggest that the increased excitability of the specific amygdaloid subdivisions including the central nucleus , and of the projection targets such as the hypothalamus and midbrain in fyn -LRB- - / - -RRB- mice , is directly related to the enhanced fear response , and that the decreased excitability in the basolateral and lateral amygdaloid subdivisions is involved in the defective control of the neural circuit for emotional expression in this mutant .

15515005|Internuclear synapse in the amygdala is not facilitated in fear conditioning . .

15515005|The amygdala is essential for fear learning and memory .

15515005|Synaptic transmission is enhanced in two pathways in the amygdala in fear conditioning .

15515005|In this study we examined whether lateral -LRB- LA -RRB- to basolateral -LRB- BLA -RRB- amygdala synapses are potentiated and participate in intra-amygdala plasticity during the maintenance of fear memory .

15509737|Long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- of synaptic transmission in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is believed to underlie the formation and retention of fear memories .

15509737|To explore the role of inhibitory transmission in amygdala plasticity , we recorded from LA inhibitory interneurons in vitro before and after tetanization of the thalamo-LA pathway , one of the major inputs to LA involved in fear learning .

15509386|The amygdala lesions , however , clearly affected behaviors related to fear processing .

15509386|The amygdala-lesioned subjects produced more fear behaviors during social encounters than did control or hippocampus-lesioned subjects .

15509386|Although the heightened fear response of the amygdala-lesioned subjects was consistent across different testing paradigms and was observed with both familiar and novel partners , it did not preclude social interactions .

15506896|Environmental enrichment facilitates amygdala kindling but reduces kindling-induced fear in male rats . .

15501585|Disruption of reconsolidation but not consolidation of auditory fear conditioning by noradrenergic blockade in the amygdala . .

15496862|The learning and remembering of fearful events depends on the integrity of the amygdala , but how are fear memories represented in the activity of amygdala neurons ?

15496862|Here , we review recent electrophysiological studies indicating that neurons in the lateral amygdala encode aversive memories during the acquisition and extinction of Pavlovian fear conditioning .

15496862|Studies that combine unit recording with brain lesions and pharmacological inactivation provide evidence that the lateral amygdala is a crucial locus of fear memory .

15496862|Extinction of fear memory reduces associative plasticity in the lateral amygdala and involves the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex .

15496862|Understanding the signalling of aversive memory by amygdala neurons opens new avenues for research into the neural systems that support fear behaviour .

15466318|As compared with CB1 -LRB- + / + -RRB- , the nonreinforced tone presentation 24 h after auditory-cued fear conditioning led to lower levels of phosphorylated ERKs and/or calcineurin in the basolateral amygdala complex , ventromedial prefrontal cortex , dorsal hippocampus , and ventral hippocampus of CB1 -LRB- - / - -RRB- .

15466317|An egr-1 -LRB- zif268 -RRB- antisense oligodeoxynucleotide infused into the amygdala disrupts fear conditioning . .

15466317|Studies of gene expression following fear conditioning have demonstrated that the inducible transcription factor , egr-1 , is increased in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala shortly following fear conditioning .

15466317|These studies suggest that egr-1 and its protein product Egr-1 in the amygdala are important for learning and memory of fear .

15466317|To directly test this hypothesis , an egr-1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide -LRB- antisense-ODN -RRB- was injected bilaterally into the amygdala prior to contextual fear conditioning .

15466317|The antisense-ODN reduced Egr-1 protein in the amygdala and interfered with fear conditioning .

15466317|The data indicate that the egr-1 antisense-ODN interferes with learning and memory processes of fear without affecting freezing behavior and suggests that the inducible transcription factor Egr-1 within the amygdala plays important functions in long-term learning and memory of fear .

15466303|Fear extinction is context-dependent and is generally considered to involve the establishment of inhibitory control of the prefrontal cortex over amygdala-based fear processes .

15466303|In this paper , we review research progress on the neural basis of fear extinction with a focus on the role of the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex .

15466303|In addition , we present new findings showing that lesions of the basal amygdala do not affect fear extinction .

15464739|In rats , acute -LRB- 1-2 h -RRB- restraint stress transiently reduces BDNF mRNA expression in the hippocampus , a region important in the memory and in HPA regulation ; restraint stress also decreases BDNF expression in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , a region important for fear consolidation and emotional memory .

15458834|There is converging evidence that dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- receptor activation in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is required for the acquisition of conditioned fear .

15453980|The amygdala has been implicated in fundamental functions for the survival of the organism , such as fear and pain .

15453980|In accord with this , several studies have shown increased amygdala activity during fear conditioning and the processing of fear-relevant material in human subjects .

15451699|They also increase mRNA expression of activity-dependent genes -LRB- c-fos and zif/268 -RRB- in brain regions specialized for processing faces -LRB- temporal and medial frontal cortices and basolateral amygdala -RRB- and for emotional control -LRB- orbitofrontal and cingulate cortex -RRB- , and reduce their expression in regions associated with stress responses -LRB- hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus -RRB- and fear -LRB- central and lateral amygdala -RRB- .

15450349|The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- is believed to be a critical relay between the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CE -RRB- and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus in the control of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal -LRB- HPA -RRB- responses elicited by conditioned fear stimuli .

15450349|These results suggest CE is indeed an essential output of the amygdala for the expression of conditioned fear responses , including HPA responses , regardless of the nature of the conditioned stimulus .

15450161|The lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is a crucial site of neural changes that occur during fear conditioning .

15380840|Corticosterone controls the developmental emergence of fear and amygdala function to predator odors in infant rat pups . .

15380840|The behavioral emergence of fear is correlated with two physiological events : functional emergence of the amygdala and increasing corticosterone -LRB- CORT -RRB- levels .

15380840|Here , we hypothesize that increasing corticosterone levels influence amygdala activity to permit the emergence of fear expression .

15380840|We assessed the relationship between fear expression -LRB- immobility similar to freezing -RRB- , amygdala function -LRB- c-fos -RRB- and the level of corticosterone in pups in response to presentation of novel male odor -LRB- predator -RRB- , littermate odor and no odor .

15380840|Results showed that PN8 expression of fear to a predator odor and basolateral/lateral amygdala activity could be prematurely evoked with exogenous CORT , while adrenalectomy in PN12 pups prevented both fear expression and amygdala activation .

15380840|These results suggest that low neonatal CORT level serves to protect pups from responding to fear inducing stimuli and attenuate amygdala activation .

15371750|Role of amygdala in conditioned and unconditioned fear generated in the periaqueductal gray . .

15370775|The reviewed studies suggest that social phobia has a neuroanatomical basis in a highly sensitive fear network centered in the amygdaloid-hippocampal region , i.e. '' the alarm system '' of the brain , and encompassing the prefrontal cortex .

15366246|Differences in fear level assessment based on the time of motionless in the illuminated compartment , time spent in light compartment , number of head dipping from dark to the illuminated compartment and number of returns from dark to the illuminated compartment registered in light/dark transitions test and brain monoamines -LRB- NA , DA , 5-HT -RRB- and their metabolites -LRB- MHPG , DOPAC , 5-HIAA -RRB- in the hypothalamus , midbrain , amygdala , hippocampus and pons were examined in 3 , 12 and 24 months old Wistar rats .

15364481|Have no fear , erythropoietin is here : erythropoietin protects fear conditioning performances after functional inactivation of the amygdala . .

15364481|This study investigated the capacity of erythropoietin -LRB- EPO -RRB- to protect fear conditioning performances against functional inactivation of the amygdala .

15364481|We infused an excitotoxic dose of glutamate in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- of adult rats in order to block the output projections to brainstem areas controlling the expression of conditioned fear responses .

15363399|Consistent with animal models suggesting that the amygdala is important for both the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear , amygdala activation was correlated across subjects with the conditioned response in both acquisition and early extinction .

15342732|Selective neurotoxic lesions of basolateral and central nuclei of the amygdala produce differential effects on fear conditioning . .

15342732|In the fear conditioning literature , it is generally hypothesized that neurons in the basolateral amygdalar complex -LRB- BLA -RRB- -LRB- lateral and basal nuclei -RRB- support the formation of conditioned fear memory and project to neurons in the central nucleus -LRB- CeA -RRB- for the expression of conditioned fear responses .

15336949|Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor reduces conditioned fear through its effect in the amygdala . .

15336949|To clarify the brain regions where selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors act , we examined the effect of microinjection of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , citalopram , into the amygdala , medial prefrontal cortex and mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus on freezing behavior , an index of fear , induced by conditioned fear stress .

15336949|These results suggest that the anxiolytic effect of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor in conditioned fear is mediated by its effect in the amygdala , and support the hypothesis of serotonin function in anxiety by which facilitation of serotonin neurotransmission decreases anxiety .

15325957|Extinction of learned fear involves gene expression , protein synthesis , N-methyl-D-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- receptors and signaling pathways in the hippocampus and the amygdala at the time of the first CS-no US association .

15325419|Human neuroimaging studies implicate the amygdala , medial prefrontal and somatosensory-related cortices as key neural components in the perception of facial fear signals .

15323235|These studies have demonstrated that schizophrenic patients relative to healthy controls fail to activate the amygdala in response to facial expressions of fear , and also during a sadness induction paradigm .

15323235|These recent findings reflect functional amygdala abnormalities in overt displays of fear in schizophrenic patients .

15322551|Mice acquire a conditioned fear response rapidly to an auditory cue but slowly to a visual cue , a difference in learned behavior that is likely to be mediated by direct projections to the lateral amygdala from the auditory thalamus but mainly indirect ones from the visual thalamus .

15312899|An important output of amygdaloid nuclei , the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- not only mediates negative emotional behaviors , but also participates in the stimulus-reward learning and expression of motivational aspects of many drugs of abuse , and links environmentally stressful conditions such as fear to endogenous pain-inhibiting mechanisms .

15308672|We have identified a novel member of the Ndr subfamily of serine/threonine protein kinases , Ndr2 , as a gene product that is induced in the mouse amygdala during fear memory consolidation and examined a possible function of this kinase in neural differentiation .

15308672|Its expression in the amygdala was increased 6 h after Pavlovian fear conditioning training and returned to control levels within 24 h. To study intracellular localization and functions of Ndr2 , EGFP : : Ndr2 fusion proteins were expressed in rat pheochromocytoma -LRB- PC12 -RRB- cells and acutely isolated cortical neurons , thereby revealing an association of Ndr2 with the actin cytoskeleton in somata , neurites and filopodia , in spines and at sites of cell contact .

15291242|Recently it has been suggested that the combination of SSRI and benzodiazepine is rational , because each drug has a different mechanism of action , the benzodiazepines enhancing GABAergic transmission , and the SSRIs stimulating the 5-HT1A receptor that may inhibit the postsynaptic neuronal excitability in the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex that comprise the brain circuit of fear and anxiety .

15275785|Using formalin-induced conditioned place avoidance -LRB- F-CPA -RRB- and electric foot-shock conditioned place avoidance -LRB- S-CPA -RRB- models , the present study observed the effects of bilateral excitotoxic -LRB- quinolinic acid 200 nmol/microl -RRB- lesions of the ACC and amygdala on pain and fear induced negative emotion , as well as on sensory component of pain .

15271583|Chronic antidepressant administration increases the cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein -LRB- CREB -RRB- in the amygdala , a critical neural substrate involved in the physiologic responses to stress , fear , and anxiety .

15271583|Expression of CREB in the basolateral amygdala also increased behavioral measures of anxiety in both the open field test and the elevated plus maze , and enhanced cued fear conditioning .

15271583|Taken together , these data demonstrate that CREB expression in the basolateral amygdala influences behavior in models of depression , anxiety , and fear .

15262319|Extinction deficit and fear reinstatement after electrical stimulation of the amygdala : implications for kindling-associated fear and anxiety . .

15262319|After classical conditioning -LRB- light + footshock pairings -RRB- laboratory rats were fear extinguished with each light presentation followed by nonepileptogenic amygdala stimulation .

15262319|In contrast to the normal extinction learning of control subjects , amygdala stimulated animals exhibited conditioned fear after 120 presentations of the nonreinforced conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- .

15262319|In a second experiment electrical stimulation of the amygdala restored extinguished fear responding and the fear reinstatement was specific to extinction context .

15262319|The reinstatement effect did not involve sensitized fear to the CS produced by amygdala stimulation .

15262319|The possibility that electrical activation of the amygdala produces unconditioned fear was considered .

15262319|The extinction deficit and fear reinstatement results were interpreted to suggest that amygdala stimulation activates acquired excitatory stimulus-affect neural connections formed during Pavlovian fear conditioning .

15262319|Our data supports a model in which excitation of an amygdala-based memory-retrieval system reinforces the expression of learned fear behaviors .

15255988|Extinction of classical fear conditioning is thought to involve activity-dependent potentiation of synaptic transmission in the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- , resulting in the inhibition of amygdala-dependent fear responses .

15255988|Here we show , using a combined electrophysiological and immunocytochemical approach , that spontaneous recovery of conditioned fear in mice is associated with a prolonged expression of long-term depression of synaptic transmission in the mPFC and the failure of induction of the immediate-early genesc-Fos and zif268 in the mPFC and the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala .

15255988|This suggests that coordinated activity-dependent changes in gene expression in the mPFC and the amygdala may underlie the formation of long-term fear extinction memory .

15233764|Collectively , these results show that during maintenance of fear memory the stimulus requirements for amygdala afferents and critical signaling mechanisms for amygdala synaptic potentiation are altered , suggesting that cue-engaged synaptic mechanisms in the amygdala are dramatically affected as a result of emotional learning .

15233763|NMDA receptors are essential for the acquisition , but not expression , of conditional fear and associative spike firing in the lateral amygdala . .

15233763|We examined the contribution of N-methyl-D-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- receptors -LRB- NMDARs -RRB- to the acquisition and expression of amygdaloid plasticity and Pavlovian fear conditioning using single-unit recording techniques in behaving rats .

15233763|Administration of the competitive NMDAR antagonist + / -- 3 - -LRB- 2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl -RRB- propyl-1-phosphonic acid -LRB- CPP -RRB- prior to auditory fear conditioning completely abolished the acquisition of conditional freezing and conditional single-unit activity in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- .

15233763|Together , these data suggest that NMDARs are essential for the acquisition of conditioning-related plasticity in the amygdala , and that NMDARs are more critical for regulating synaptic plasticity and learning than routine synaptic transmission in the circuitry supporting fear conditioning .

15225971|The latter 's role in emotional processing is also distinct from that of the amygdala , which is associated specifically with fear .

15212433|New vistas on amygdala networks in conditioned fear . .

15212433|It is currently believed that the acquisition of classically conditioned fear involves potentiation of conditioned thalamic inputs in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- .

15201323|The role of the central nucleus of the amygdala in mediating fear and anxiety in the primate . .

15201323|To examine the role of the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- in mediating the behavioral and physiological responses associated with fear and anxiety , we used rhesus monkeys to assess the effects of excitotoxic lesions of the CeA .

15196652|In humans , bilateral amygdala damage is followed by impaired recognition of facial expressions of fear .

15193757|The proposal of a functional similarity between the fish MP and the mammalian amygdala , known to be involved in fear conditioning , suggests a conservative phylogenetic role of this area in avoidance learning .

15191640|The neurobiology of conditioned and unconditioned fear : a neurobehavioral system analysis of the amygdala . .

15191640|It is suggested that the basolateral complex of the amygdala and the central nucleus of the amygdala are part of the neural circuitry for fear conditioning but not for unconditioned fear to a predator odor .

15191640|Furthermore , changes in expression of the transcription factor early growth response gene 1 in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala are shown to be important for contextual fear conditioning but not for unconditioned fear to a predator odor .

15187885|Structural brain imagery has revealed volumetric alterations of the amygdala , a major participant in emotional and fear responses .

15157426|Early amygdala reaction to fear spreading in occipital , temporal , and frontal cortex : a depth electrode ERP study in human . .

15157426|The amygdala involvement in fear processing has been reported in behavioral , electrophysiological , and functional imaging studies .

15157426|Specific potentials to fear beginning 200 ms poststimulus were observed in amygdala , both individually in two patients and in a ten patient population study .

15157426|Potentials to fear were confined in amygdala during a first transient period and then , during a second period of sustained activity , spread to occipito-temporal , anterior temporal , and orbitofrontal cortex in two patients .

15152040|Brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tyrosine kinase receptor B involvement in amygdala-dependent fear conditioning . .

15152040|Here , the use of Pavlovian fear conditioning as a learning model allows us to examine the concise role of BDNF in the amygdala after a single learning session and within a well understood neural circuit .

15152040|These data suggest that BDNF signaling through TrkB receptors in the amygdala is required for the acquisition of conditioned fear .

15145764|This study compared the effect of pre - and posttraining bilateral lesions of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus with those of the amygdala on contextual conditioned fear .

15145764|In contrast to lesions of the amygdala , those of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus failed to alter the increased defecation induced by conditioned fear stress .

15145764|Possible neural circuits , incorporating the amygdala , MD , and hippocampus , and the functional similarity of the MD and hippocampus in contextual fear conditioning , are also discussed .

15142288|Recent neuroscientific findings indicate that psychosomatic reactions , set off by a danger situation , depend on the primitive circuit of fear -LRB- including the amygdala -RRB- characterised by its speed , but lack accurate responses and may also be activated by harmless stimuli perceived erroneously as dangerous .

15138438|Increased fear learning coincides with neuronal dysinhibition and facilitated LTP in the basolateral amygdala following benzodiazepine withdrawal in rats . .

15129783|Corticosterone facilitates retention of contextually conditioned fear and increases CRH mRNA expression in the amygdala . .

15114344|On the other hand , comorbid anxiety is related to impaired synaptic processes , which selectively gate fear -LRB- or aggressive -RRB- responses from the amygdala at the accumbens .

15113270|The modulation of the ASR by fear depends critically on the amygdala .

15113265|This suggests that IL gates the response of downstream structures such as the amygdala to fear stimuli .

15113258|Medial amygdala modulation of predator odor-induced unconditioned fear in the rat . .

15113258|This study examined the participation of the medial amygdala -LRB- MeA -RRB- in unconditioned fear .

15113256|Estrogen and/or progesterone administered systemically or to the amygdala can have anxiety - , fear - , and pain-reducing effects in ovariectomized rats . .

15113256|Estrogen -LRB- E2 -RRB- and/or progesterone -LRB- P -RRB- in the amygdala may influence anxiety , fear , and pain behaviors .

15113256|Thus , E2 and P may have effects in the amygdala to decrease anxiety , fear , and/or pain responses .

15110029|Dissociable amygdala and orbitofrontal responses during reversal fear conditioning . .

15110029|Here we describe dissociable neural responses in amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex during acquisition and reversal of discriminatory fear conditioning .

15110029|Thus , while orbitofrontal cortex exhibited rapid reversal of acquired fear responses , ventral amygdala showed a persistent , nonreversing '' memory '' for previous fear-related stimulus associations .

15102957|Acetylation of nuclear factor-kappaB in rat amygdala improves long-term but not short-term retention of fear memory . .

15102957|We have previously shown that nuclear factor kappaB -LRB- NF-kappaB -RRB- is activated in the amygdala after fear conditioning .

15087581|Bilateral amygdala damage has been linked with an inability to recognise facial expressions of emotion , particularly the expression of fear .

15084662|Role of the basolateral amygdala in the storage of fear memories across the adult lifetime of rats . .

15084662|The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is intimately involved in the development of conditional fear .

15084425|It has also been reported that amygdala is involved in the acquisition of conditioned fear to foreground cues such as light , used as CS .

15084425|As the MR projects to the hippocampus and amygdala , the role of this raphe nucleus in fear conditioning to contextual and classical fear conditioning remains to be elucidated .

15082020|Influence of chronic corticosterone and glucocorticoid receptor antagonism in the amygdala on fear conditioning . .

15082020|Glucocorticoid receptor activation within the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- during fear conditioning may mediate enhancement in rats chronically exposed to stress levels of corticosterone .

15075447|In contrast , in a women predominant population of IBS patients , we did not observed any neuronal activation in locations activated in healthy volunteers -LRB- ACC , dorsolateral PFC -RRB- while a significant deactivation was observed in the IC and in the amygdala , a limbic structure with a role to assign emotional significance to a current experience related to anxiety and fear .

15072680|Although the amygdala 's role in processing facial expressions of fear has been well established , its role in the processing of other emotions is unclear .

15072680|The findings suggest that the amygdala 's role in processing of emotional facial expressions encompasses multiple negatively valenced emotions , including fear and sadness .

15070527|Mainly dependent on level and dynamic increase sound produces over-shooting excitations which activate subcortical processing centers -LRB- e.g. the amygdala , functioning as fear conditioning center -RRB- besides cortical areas -LRB- e. g. arousing annoyance , awakenings -RRB- as well .

15062974|Unconditioned stimulus pathways to the amygdala : effects of posterior thalamic and cortical lesions on fear conditioning . .

15062974|Plasticity in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala is thought to be critical for the acquisition of Pavlovian fear conditioning .

15062974|Thus , somatosensory regions of the thalamus and cortex may well be important routes of unconditioned stimulus transmission to the amygdala in fear conditioning , but information about the unconditioned somatosensory stimulus is also transmitted from other sources that send fibers through , but do not form essential synapses in , the thalamus en route to the amygdala .

15056707|Pavlovian fear conditioning regulates Thr286 autophosphorylation of Ca2 + / calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II at lateral amygdala synapses . .

15056707|Furthermore , we show that fear conditioning results in an increase of the autophosphorylated -LRB- active -RRB- form of alphaCaMKII in lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- spines .

15056707|Together , the results of these experiments provide the first comprehensive view of the role of CaMKII in the amygdala during fear conditioning .

15056703|Here we test this notion by investigating the relative contributions of the cerebellum , the amygdala , and the hippocampus to the emergence of conditioned eyelid and fear responses during delay eyeblink conditioning in freely moving rats .

15050573|Next we applied these stimulus parameters in an fMRI experiment to determine whether non-consciously perceived -LRB- covert -RRB- facial expressions of fear and disgust show the same double dissociation -LRB- amygdala response to fear , insula to disgust -RRB- observed with consciously perceived -LRB- overt -RRB- stimuli .

15050573|In the covert condition -LRB- 30 ms -RRB- , the amygdala was not activated to fear , nor was the insula activated to disgust .

15044528|Facial expressions of fear and anger , which both signal potential threat to an observer , result in significant increases in amygdala activity , even when the faces are unattended or presented briefly and masked .

15044074|The relationship between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala during the presentation of an unconditioned fear stimulus was assessed .

15044074|These data show that increased serotonin and glutamate tone and decreased gabaergic tone in the amygdala correlate to elevated fear and anxiety after prefrontal cortex ibotenic acid lesion .

15027419|The aim was to examine amygdala activation to fear .

15027419|Those who reported increased fear showed right amygdala activation during the threat condition and left amygdala activation in the safe condition .

15026504|The human amygdala is implicated in the formation of emotional memories and the perception of emotional stimuli -- particularly fear -- across various modalities .

15026504|Patients with bilateral amygdala damage had greater impairment , particularly on the narrative test of emotional memory , one showing superior fear recognition but absent memory enhancement .

15003392|In theories about the amygdala 's role in conditioned fear , the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is the primary , perhaps unique , interface for incoming conditioned sensory stimuli and the central nucleus is the major output station .

15003392|Recent studies indicate , however , that amygdala output pathways may be dissociated as a function of the type of conditioned fear behavior .

14999084|Therefore , in the present study we investigated whether the immediate pretraining or post-training bilateral infusion of arcaine , an antagonist of the NMDA receptor polyamine-binding site , or spermidine , an agonist of the NMDA receptor polyamine-binding site , into the amygdala affected classical fear conditioning in rats .

14992974|In the comparison subjects , arousal dissociated amygdala/medial prefrontal -LRB- '' visceral '' -RRB- networks and hippocampus/lateral prefrontal -LRB- '' context '' -RRB- networks for fear perception .

14988500|The acid-sensing ion channel 1a -LRB- ASIC1a -RRB- is abundantly expressed in the amygdala complex and other brain regions associated with fear .

14988500|The amygdala showed prominent expression , and overexpressing ASIC1a enhanced fear conditioning , an animal model of acquired anxiety .

14979779|Amygdalar lateralization in fear conditioning : evidence for greater involvement of the right amygdala . .

14979779|The relative contribution of left and right amygdalae in the acquisition and retention of fear conditioning was investigated in rats .

14979779|Pretraining bilateral electrolytic lesions blocked the acquisition of conditioned fear to tone and context , whereas unilateral lesions induced partial impairments with no left-right amygdala differences .

14979779|Although no left-right difference was observed to tone , the right amygdala lesions generated greater deficits in contextual fear than the left amygdala lesions .

14979779|These results indicate that fear conditioning is partially disrupted with unilateral amygdalar lesions , but that the right amygdala has greater involvement than the left amygdala when conditioning occurs under a normal brain state .

14979778|Contextual fear conditioning is associated with lateralized expression of the immediate early gene c-fos in the central and basolateral amygdalar nuclei . .

14970831|The amygdala is believed to be highly relevant to the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder -LRB- OCD -RRB- given its prominent role in fear conditioning and because it is an important target of the serotonin reuptake inhibitors -LRB- SRIs -RRB- , the pharmacotherapy of choice for OCD .

14766647|The amygdala is a distinctive portion of the anterior temporal lobe that has been implicated in a variety of functions including expression of fear , modulation of memory , and mediation of social communication .

14766647|This perspective predicts that hyperactivity of the amygdala would be associated with increased fear or anxiety and may contribute to disorders such as social phobia .

14766193|Here we asked whether prenatal stress also has an impact on the development of the amygdala , because this structure plays a direct role in the emotions of anxiety and fear .

14744467|Persistent , intrusive re-experiencing in posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- is commonly construed as a failure of cingulate inhibition -LRB- i.e. , extinction -RRB- over a hyperresponsive amygdala , based primarily on animal research of fear conditioning and the finding of cingulate hypoperfusion in PTSD .

14715141|Long-term synaptic modifications in afferent inputs to the amygdala underlie fear conditioning in animals .

14706775|N-methyl-D-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- receptors within the amygdala play an important role in conditioned fear ; therefore , the purpose of this study was to examine whether NMDA receptors within the amygdala are necessary for the acquisition and expression of conditioned defeat .

14689142|Functional brain imaging has shown that expressions of fear and anger selectively activate the amygdala , even when the faces conveying the emotion are presented briefly and masked to prevent conscious perception -LRB- Morris et al. 1998 ; Whalen et al. 1998 -RRB- .

14680638|We show that exposure to body expressions of fear , as opposed to neutral body postures , activates the fusiform gyrus and the amygdala .

14659099|Auditory-evoked spike firing in the lateral amygdala and Pavlovian fear conditioning : mnemonic code or fear bias ? .

14659099|However , a fear state may nonassociatively enhance sensory processing , biasing CS-evoked activity in amygdala neurons .

14659099|Here we describe experiments that dissociate auditory CS-evoked spike firing in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- and both conditional fear behavior and LA excitability in rats .

14656303|Protein synthesis in the amygdala , but not the auditory thalamus , is required for consolidation of Pavlovian fear conditioning in rats . .

14656303|The amygdala is an essential neural substrate for Pavlovian fear conditioning .

14656303|Nevertheless , long-term synaptic plasticity in amygdaloid afferents , such as the auditory thalamus , may contribute to the formation of fear memories .

14656303|We therefore compared the influence of protein synthesis inhibition in the amygdala and the auditory thalamus on the consolidation of Pavlovian fear conditioning in Long-Evans rats .

14656303|These results reveal that the establishment of long-term fear memories requires protein synthesis in the amygdala , but not the thalamus , after auditory fear conditioning .

14656303|Forms of synaptic plasticity that depend on protein synthesis , such as long-term potentiation , are likely candidates for the encoding and long-term storage of fear memories in the amygdala .

14640318|Considering the amygdala as a ` relevance detector ' would integrate the ` fear module ' hypothesis with the concept of an evolved neural system devoted to the processing of a broader category of biologically relevant stimuli .

14628702|Research showing the role of the amygdala in fear conditioning and of the cerebellum in eyelid conditioning is reviewed , both at the circuit and cellular plasticity levels .

14614087|NMDA currents and receptor protein are downregulated in the amygdala during maintenance of fear memory . .

14614087|The amygdala plays a critical role in fear conditioning , a model of emotional learning and cue-induced anxiety .

14614087|In the lateral amygdala , fear conditioning is associated with an enduring increase in synaptic strength mediated through AMPA receptors and with a reduction in paired-pulse facilitation , reflecting an increased probability of neurotransmitter release .

14614087|Here we show that NMDA-mediated transmission in the thalamic-to-lateral amygdala pathway is not facilitated after fear conditioning , although probability of transmitter release is enhanced .

14614087|These data indicate that postsynaptic mechanisms are involved in synaptic plasticity in the thalamoamygdala pathway in fear conditioning and raise the possibility that : -LRB- 1 -RRB- downregulation of the NMDA receptor may protect against excitotoxicity of unchecked NMDA receptor recruitment during induction and consolidation of fear memories , -LRB- 2 -RRB- reduced NMDA current and protein may allow persistence of the '' capacity to reactivate '' amygdala pathways in NMDA receptor-dependent fear memories , or -LRB- 3 -RRB- a persistent long-term depression of NMDA transmission may occur after fear learning .

14606694|These findings lead to the conclusion that an important role for the amygdala is in the detection of threats and mobilizing an appropriate behavioral response , part of which is fear .

14584827|This paper reviews that subject , concentrating on : a -RRB- the ability of severe and/or prolonged stress to impair hippocampal-dependent explicit learning and the plasticity that underlies it ; b -RRB- the ability of mild and transient stress to facilitate such plasticity ; c -RRB- the ability of a range of stressors to enhance implicit fear conditioning , and to enhance the amygdaloid plasticity that underlies it .

14583739|Activation of alpha2 adrenergic receptors suppresses fear conditioning : expression of c-Fos and phosphorylated CREB in mouse amygdala . .

14575871|The data are discussed with respect to the putative role of brainstem nuclei in regulating REM and the role of the amygdala in conditioned fear .

14534353|Because amygdala NMDA receptors play a significant role in many learned fear behaviors , chronic ethanol-induced adaptations in these receptors may influence the expression of withdrawal anxiety .

14521193|These findings lead to the conclusion that an important role for the amygdala is in the detection of threats and mobilizing an appropriate behavioural response , part of which is fear .

14514027|The emotional brain , fear , and the amygdala . .

14514027|The major conclusion from studies of fear conditioning is that the amygdala plays critical role in linking external stimuli to defense responses .

14514027|Before describing research on the role of the amygdala in fear conditioning , though , it will be helpful to briefly examine the historical events that preceded modern research on conditioned fear .

14507980|mPFC has robust projections to the amygdala , a structure that is known to mediate the acquisition and expression of conditioned fear .

12968003|Context-dependent neuronal activity in the lateral amygdala represents fear memories after extinction . .

12968003|Contextual modulation of spike firing in the amygdala is a putative mechanism for the context-specific expression of extinguished fear .

12967919|Brain regions implicated in processing facial affect , including the amygdala and fusiform gyrus , showed greater responses to dynamic versus static emotional expressions , especially for fear .

12959156|Slow late component in conditioned stimulus-evoked potentials from the amygdala after fear conditioning in the rat . .

12959156|Before and after fear conditioning , we recorded the evoked potentials elicited by CS + and CS - from electrodes aimed at the lateral nucleus of the amygdala .

12959156|The collective results indicate that the large late component in the amygdala is enhanced by fear conditioning , suggesting that such enhancement reflects the anticipation of a biologically significant event .

12959153|Foreground cues like light , used as a conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- in classical fear conditioning , also cause freezing through thalamic transmission to the amygdala .

12959153|As the MRN projects to the hippocampus and amygdala , the role of this raphe nucleus in fear conditioning to explicit cues remains to be explained .

12958079|Dosage-sensitive X-linked locus influences the development of amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex , and fear recognition in humans . .

12958079|Their fear recognition is as poor as that of 45 , X females and their amygdalae are correspondingly enlarged .

12954874|Extinction is mostly studied with fear conditioning and is impaired by lesions of the prefrontal cortex as well as by blockade of NMDA receptors in the amygdala .

12931959|Pretraining NMDA receptor blockade in the basolateral complex , but not the central nucleus , of the amygdala prevents savings of conditional fear . .

12931959|The acquisition of conditional freezing is abolished by N-methyl-D-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- receptor antagonism in the basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- during fear conditioning , suggesting that memory formation is prevented .

12931959|The present study examined whether there is residual memory , or '' savings , '' for fear conditioning in rats trained under amygdaloid NMDA receptor blockade .

12931959|Rats infused with D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate -LRB- APV -RRB- into the BLA or central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CEA -RRB- during fear conditioning did not acquire either auditory or contextual fear conditioning .

12894812|A functional MRI study of human amygdala responses to facial expressions of fear versus anger . .

12894812|Functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- of the human brain was used to compare changes in amygdala activity associated with viewing facial expressions of fear and anger .

12894812|The blood oxygen-level dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- fMRI signal within the dorsal amygdala was significantly greater to Fear versus Anger , in a direct contrast .

12894812|Significant BOLD signal changes in the ventral amygdala were observed in contrasts of Fear versus Neutral expressions and , in a more spatially circumscribed region , to Anger versus Neutral expressions .

12894812|Furthermore , directly contrasting fear with angry faces highlighted involvement of the dorsal amygdaloid region .

12893418|Our study confirms the role of the amygdala in fear processing and provides insights into brain activation patterns when animal phobics are confronted with phobia-related stimuli .

12890768|Post-training intra-basolateral amygdala infusions of norepinephrine enhance consolidation of memory for contextual fear conditioning . .

12888548|Complex effects of NMDA receptor antagonist APV in the basolateral amygdala on acquisition of two-way avoidance reaction and long-term fear memory . .

12888548|Although much has been learned about the role of the amygdala in Pavlovian fear conditioning , relatively little is known about an involvement of this structure in more complex aversive learning , such as acquisition of an active avoidance reaction .

12888548|However , APV injection led to impaired retention of contextual fear when tested 48 h later , along with an attenuation of c-Fos expression in the amygdala .

12888548|These data indicate that normal functioning of NMDA receptors in the basolateral amygdala is required during acquisition of adaptive instrumental responses in a shuttle box but is not necessary for acquisition of short-term contextual fear in this situation .

12888544|Spared anterograde memory for shock-probe fear conditioning after inactivation of the amygdala . .

12888544|This finding has been interpreted as indicating that amygdala lesions reduce fear .

12867983|Selectively activating GABA -LRB- B -RRB- - receptor-bearing RAIC neurons produces hyperalgesia through projections to the amygdala , an area involved in pain and fear .

12843409|Analysis of fear conditioning in rats has suggested that long-term synaptic plasticity of inputs to the amygdala underlies the acquisition and perhaps storage of the fear memory .

12843265|These results suggest that automaticity is not fundamental to the processing of all facial signals of threat , but is unique to amygdala processing of fear .

12843265|Furthermore , amygdala processing of fear was not entirely automatic , coming at the expense of specificity of response .

12843249|We also tested the effect of ASIC1 on amygdala-dependent behavior ; ASIC1-null mice displayed deficits in cue and context fear conditioning , yet baseline fear on the elevated plus maze was intact .

12823477|Long-term memory underlying Pavlovian fear conditioning is believed to involve plasticity at sensory input synapses in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- .

12805306|Further supporting a role of the alpha2 subunit in the function of the amygdala , heterozygous adult mice showed augmented fear/anxiety behaviors and enhanced neuronal activity in the amygdala and piriform cortex after conditioned fear stimuli .

12791983|Effects of gaze on amygdala sensitivity to anger and fear faces . .

12784931|Activation of the amygdala in the negative condition supports the well documented engagement of this structure in processing of fear and disgust .

12752384|Repeated withdrawal from ethanol , a procedure which resembles amygdala kindling in increasing seizure sensitivity , impairs the acquisition of fear conditioning -LRB- Stephens et al. , 2001 , Eur .

12742672|These results suggest that at least one primary function of the amygdala is to detect and process unexpected or unfamiliar events that have potential biological import , of which stimuli symbolic of fear or threat are but one possible example .

12740581|Our findings provide a cellular mechanism for the dopaminergic modulation of fear conditioning and indicate that suppression of feedforward inhibition represents a key mechanism for the induction of associative synaptic plasticity in the lateral amygdala .

12724183|Associative plasticity in neurons of the lateral amygdala during auditory fear conditioning . .

12724173|The amygdala is known to play an important role in normal fear conditioning and is implicated in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders .

12724169|We reviewed and reanalyzed data from our laboratory , indicating that subjective feelings of fear and distress are correlated with regional cerebral blood flow -LRB- rCBF -RRB- in the right but not the left amygdala during anxiety provocation in individuals with social anxiety disorder , specific phobias .

12724169|However , because studies demonstrate that treatment of social anxiety disorder with cognitive behavior therapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors results in reduced rCBF in the amygdaloid complex and prospective studies reveal that treatment-induced alterations in amygdala rCBF can predict 1 year follow-up status in social anxiety disorder data support the notion that the amygdala , at least in part , seem casually involved in generating the subjective experience of fear .

12724167|The amygdala is implicated in a number of emotional responses including conditioned fear and anxiety , and it appears to regulate the behavioral and autonomic responses associated with such emotional responses .

12724164|Cue-induced craving in humans is associated with feelings of fear and autonomic arousal , suggesting a link between fear and addiction in the amygdala .

12724163|A combination of behavioral studies and a neural systems analysis approach has proven fruitful in defining the role of the amygdala complex and associated circuits in fear conditioning .

12724162|Moreover , the data show marked parallels with data derived from aversive -LRB- fear -RRB- conditioning studies and are consistent with the idea that these subsystems of the amygdala mediate different kinds of associative representation formed during pavlovian conditioning .

12724161|Role of the amygdala in fear extinction measured with potentiated startle . .

12724161|Infusions into the amygdala -LRB- a brain area essential for excitatory fear conditioning -RRB- of either NMDA receptor antagonists or inhibitors of the NMDA-receptor-linked mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade block extinction learning .

12724155|Fear conditioning , a behavioral model of fear learning and cue-related anxiety , causes enhanced neuronal transmission in the thalamic to lateral amygdala pathway .

12724155|These findings suggest that L-type calcium channels play a role in the amygdala in cued fear conditioning and have important implications in the treatment of anxiety and in emotional learning and plasticity .

12724154|The amygdala , fear , and memory . .

12724154|Lesions of the frontotemporal region of the amygdala , which includes lateral and basal nuclei , cause a loss of conditional fear responses , such as freezing , even when the lesions are made over a year and a half from the original training .

12724154|This inflation of fear memory is abolished if the frontotemporal amygdala is inactivated by muscimol only during the inflation treatment with strong shocks .

12724154|Based on such findings we suggest that the frontotemporal amygdala permanently encodes a memory for the hedonic value of the aversive stimulus used to condition fear .

12724152|The amygdala , synaptic plasticity , and fear memory . .

12724152|Although it is generally agreed that the amygdala is involved in several forms of emotional learning and memory such as pavlovian fear conditioning , a recent debate has emerged concerning the precise role of the amygdala in learning versus performing fear responses .

12724152|I argue that the basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- normally plays an essential role in associative processes in fear conditioning .

12724151|Genes and mechanisms in the amygdala involved in the formation of fear memory . .

12724151|With a combined molecular , electrophysiological , and behavioral approach we have sought to correlate conditioned fear behavior with electrophysiological activities in the lateral amygdala and hippocampal formation in mice and rats and to determine the potential contribution of effector genes that are expressed in the basolateral amygdaloid complex during the late phase of pavlovian fear conditioning .

12724151|Our data indicate that resonant/oscillatory electrical activity in projection neurons of the lateral amygdala provide an important cellular element of coherent theta activity in amygdalohippocampal pathways , which may represent a nondiscriminating neural correlate of conditioned fear .

12724151|Moreover , associative fear conditioning results in selective gene expression in the basolateral amygdaloid complex , involving molecular factors of structural reorganization and signal transduction , particularly GABA function , supporting the view that the amygdala is a site of neural plasticity and information storage during formation of fear memory .

12724150|New data on the organization of the intra-amygdaloid circuit is reviewed , beginning with the basolateral -LRB- BL -RRB- complex , the main input station of the amygdala for sensory afferents , and concluding with the central -LRB- CE -RRB- nucleus , an important source of projections to brain-stem structures mediating fear responses .

12724149|The amygdala plays a major role in the acquisition and expression of fear conditioning .

12724149|NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity within the basolateral amygdala has been proposed to underlie the acquisition and possible storage of fear memories .

12689471|Very recently a study using Functional-Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- demonstrated that an amygdalar contribution to conditioned fear learning can be revealed in normal human subjects too .

12679470|The amygdala is important in the processing of emotion and generation of fear , whereas the hippocampus plays an important role in memory .

12677354|Serotonergic processes have been implicated in the modulation of fear conditioning in humans , postulated to occur at the level of the amygdala .

12649570|Exposure of the developing brain to severe and/or prolonged stress may result in hyperactivity/hyperreactivity of the stress system , with resultant amygdala hyperfunction -LRB- fear reaction -RRB- , decreased activity of the hippocampus -LRB- defective glucocorticoid-negative feedback , cognition -RRB- , and the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system -LRB- dysthymia , novelty-seeking , addictive behaviors -RRB- , hyperactivation of the HPA axis -LRB- hypercortisolism -RRB- , suppression of reproductive , growth , thyroid and immune functions , and changes in pain perception .

12646288|Foot drumming elicited by aversive conditioning alone or in combination with fluoxetine was abolished by administration of L-760735 and by amygdala lesions involving the basolateral and lateral nuclei , indicating that this behaviour is an alarm signal or fear response mediated via release of substance P in brain circuits involving the amygdala .

12631528|The amygdala is intimately involved in encoding of emotions , especially those related to fear .

12631528|In addition , since the amygdala has been associated with the processing of facial expressions of emotion , particularly those of fear , the present data furthermore suggest that previous detoxifications may be related to changes within the amygdala .

12629159|Here we show for the first time that fear training-induced phosphorylation of specific substrates in the rat amygdala is reduced after extinction trials and is accompanied by an increase in the protein level and enzymatic activity of calcineurin .

12619902|Functional MRI of human amygdala activity during Pavlovian fear conditioning : stimulus processing versus response expression . .

12619902|Although laboratory animal studies have shown that the amygdala plays multiple roles in conditional fear , less is known about the human amygdala .

12619902|These data support the view that the amygdala is important for the expression of learned behavioral responses during Pavlovian fear conditioning .

12600711|Role of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis versus the amygdala in fear , stress , and anxiety . .

12591150|A differential role has been suggested for two important areas in the neural circuitry of stress , central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- and bed nucleus of stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- in the extended amygdala , in regulating fear versus anxiety .

12573516|The extended amygdala , a morphological and functional entity within the basal forebrain , is a neuronal substrate for emotional states like fear and anxiety .

12531962|A case is reported of a patient who has bilateral amygdala damage and marked impairment in the perception of emotion , particularly fear .

12526985|The PBN , with its reciprocal relationships with the extended central amygdaloid nucleus , infralimbic cortex , and hypothalamus , appears to be an important node in a primary network that processes convergent vestibular , somatic , and visceral information processing to mediate avoidance conditioning , anxiety , and conditioned fear responses .

12526815|Identification of a signaling network in lateral nucleus of amygdala important for inhibiting memory specifically related to learned fear . .

12526815|We identified the Grp gene , encoding gastrin-releasing peptide , as being highly expressed both in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala , the nucleus where associations for Pavlovian learned fear are formed , and in the regions that convey fearful auditory information to the lateral nucleus .

12526815|These experiments provide genetic evidence that GRP and its neural circuitry operate as a negative feedback regulating fear and establish a causal relationship between Grpr gene expression , LTP , and amygdala-dependent memory for fear .

12514197|Muscimol , a GABA -LRB- A -RRB- receptor agonist , was injected -LRB- 4.4 nmol/0 .5 microl -RRB- into the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- as well as into the amygdala , two brain areas known to be involved in anxiety and fear .

12514197|These results , and other findings in the literature , suggest that the BNST is critically involved in unlearned fear , whereas the amygdala is more involved in the acquisition and expression of learned fear .

12507042|Neuropsychological studies reported that bilateral amygdala-damaged patients had impaired recognition of facial expressions of fear .

12507042|These findings support the idea that amygdala-damaged patients have impaired processing of facial expressions relating to certain negative emotions , particularly fear and anger .

12492306|Group II metabotropic glutamate receptors within the amygdala regulate fear as assessed with potentiated startle in rats . .

12492306|The contribution to fear and fear learning of amygdala Group II metabotropic glutamate receptors was examined in rats .

12492306|Thus , Group II metabotropic receptors within or very near the amygdala regulate fear and fear learning and are a potential target for anxiolytic compounds .

12488535|Involvement of a calcineurin cascade in amygdala depotentiation and quenching of fear memory . .

12488535|If fear memory is expressed by a long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- of synaptic transmission in the amygdala , then reversal of LTP -LRB- depotentiation -RRB- in this area of the brain may provide an important mechanism for amelioration of anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder .

12488535|The same stimulating protocol applied to the amygdala in vivo attenuates the expression of fear memory measured with fear-potentiated startle and reduces conditioning-elicited phosphorylation of Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase -LRB- MAPK -RRB- .

12486198|The results provide support for the hypothesis that the amygdala , and in particular the ACe , contributes to a heightened state of arousal during conditioned fear .

12482086|As a central fear processor of the brain , the amygdala initiates a cascade of critical physiological and behavioral responses .

12460694|We speculate that anticipatory anxiety in social phobics originates in an affect sensitive fear network encompassing the amygdaloid-hippocampal region , prefrontal , and temporal areas .

12459218|Recent brain imaging and lesion studies provide converging evidence for amygdala involvement in judgments of fear and trust based on facial expression -LSB- Adolphs et al. , Nature 393 -LRB- 1998 -RRB- 470 ; Adolphs et al. , Neuropsychologia 37 -LRB- 1999 -RRB- 1111 ; Breiter et al. , Neuron 17 -LRB- 1996 -RRB- 875 ; Winston et al. , Nat .

12457225|These processes have been intensively studied in Pavlovian fear conditioning , a leading aversive learning paradigm that is dependent on the structural and functional integrity of the amygdala .

12457225|In this review we summarise recent studies which have begun to unravel cellular processes in the amygdala that are critical for the formation of long-term fear memory and have identified molecular factors and mechanisms of neural plasticity in this brain area .

12445517|Unconscious amygdalar fear conditioning in a subset of chronic fatigue syndrome patients . .

12441060|We used fear conditioning , which is known to alter synaptic efficacy in lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- , to study molecular mechanisms underlying long-term memory .

12441060|Thus , the p190 RhoGAP/ROCK pathway , which regulates the morphology of dendrites and axons during neural development , plays a central role , through a GRB2-mediated molecular complex , in fear memory formation in the lateral amygdala .

12440575|Long-term potentiation as a substrate for memory : evidence from studies of amygdaloid plasticity and Pavlovian fear conditioning . .

12440575|In this paper , we review the many mechanistic similarities between one form of associative learning , Pavlovian fear conditioning , and amygdaloid LTP .

12437940|Gamma-aminobutyric acid may act to inhibit brain areas involved in fear learning -LRB- e.g. , the amygdala -RRB- , and glutamate , acting at N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors , may play a role in the neural plasticity that permits this GABA-mediated inhibition to be exerted appropriately .

12437934|Fourth , the amygdala seems to be the central brain area dedicated to the fear module .

12421611|Bidirectional synaptic plasticity in intercalated amygdala neurons and the extinction of conditioned fear responses . .

12421611|Classical fear conditioning is believed to result from potentiation of conditioned synaptic inputs in the basolateral amygdala .

12421611|Ultimately , these plastic events may prevent conditioned amygdala responses from exciting neurons of the central nucleus , and thus from evoking conditioned fear responses .

12404082|The potentiation of the acoustic startle response -LRB- ASR -RRB- by stimuli associated with aversive events is mediated via the amygdala and is used as an index of '' anxiety '' and '' fear '' .

12404082|In laboratory animals , cholecystokinin -LRB- B -RRB- -LRB- CCK -LRB- B -RRB- -RRB- agonists increase anxiety and fear and activation of amygdala CCK -LRB- B -RRB- receptors potentiates ASR .

12404082|To investigate the putative role of CCK -LRB- B -RRB- receptors in individual differences in fear and anxiety , we examined individual differences in amygdala CCK -LRB- B -RRB- receptor binding for animals demonstrating low versus high baseline and fear-potentiated ASR .

12395114|Most theories of amygdalar function have underscored its role in fear .

12382206|Furthermore , we suggest that the scope of the amygdala 's involvement may go beyond its well-known role in fear to its more subtle and generalized role in modulating moment-to-moment vigilance levels .

12373778|The posterior basolateral nucleus of the amygdala is known to mediate fear and anxiety and is important in assigning emotional valence to cognitive processes .

12369802|This study examined whether neurons in the medial division of the medial geniculate -LRB- MGm -RRB- and the dorsal part of the lateral amygdala -LRB- LAd -RRB- express learning-induced plasticity in paradoxical sleep -LRB- PS -RRB- after appetitive conditioning , as they do in PS after fear conditioning .

12369802|Moreover , compared with fear conditioning results , they suggest that expression of amygdalar plasticity in PS depends on the emotional salience of the stimulus .

20957557|Impaired recognition of fear in a Chinese man with bilateral cingulate and unilateral amygdala damage . .

20957557|The dissociation between recognition of fear and other emotions supported the view that the brain has separable networks for processing different emotions , and that the right amygdala as well as the anterior part of bilateral cingulate gyrus are possible substrates involved in the special network for perception of fear .

12351629|Previous studies have shown that biochemical changes that occur in the amygdala during fear conditioning in vivo are similar to those occur during long term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- in vitro .

12351629|These results provide the first evidence of a requirement of NF-kappaB activation in the amygdala for consolidation of fear memory .

12223542|In mammals , long-term memory induced by Pavlovian fear conditioning has been shown to be dependent on the amygdala during a protein and mRNA synthesis-dependent phase of memory consolidation .

12223542|Our results suggest that fear memory consolidation occurs within a broad neural circuit that includes , but is not limited to , the amygdala .

12201036|Correlation between long latency evoked potentials from amygdala and evoked cardiac response to fear conditioned stimulus in rats . .

12201036|We investigated relation between activity of central nucleus of amygdala -LRB- CE -RRB- and phasic heart rate deceleration during differential fear conditioning .

12201034|The effects of 8-OHDPAT and UH-301 injection into the dorsal raphe nucleus -LRB- DRN -RRB- on fear behavior of the light-dark transitions test and regional brain monoamines -LRB- NA , DA , 5-HT -RRB- and their metabolites -LRB- MHPG , DOPAC , 5-HIAA -RRB- in the hypothalamus -LRB- HPT -RRB- , midbrain central gray matter -LRB- MID -RRB- , amygdala -LRB- AMY -RRB- , hippocampus -LRB- HIP -RRB- and pons -LRB- PO -RRB- were examined .

12193196|Activation of histaminergic H3 receptors in the rat basolateral amygdala improves expression of fear memory and enhances acetylcholine release . .

12193196|Thus , our results further support a physiological role for synaptically released histamine , that in addition to affecting cholinergic transmission in the amygdala , modulates consolidation of fear memories

12193180|Role of NMDA receptors and MAP kinase in the amygdala in extinction of fear : clinical implications for exposure therapy . .

12193180|Infusions into the amygdala -LRB- a brain area essential for excitatory fear conditioning -RRB- of either NMDA receptor antagonists or inhibitors of the NMDA receptor-linked mitogen activated protein kinase cascade block extinction learning .

12183195|Uncertainty persists as to whether the amygdala is a crucial site of plasticity for classically conditioned fear or merely a sensory relay to structures generating fear responses .

12183195|A recent Nature study suggests that associative synaptic changes take place in neurons of the amygdala during fear conditioning , and that these changes require dopamine-mediated modulation .

12183195|Nevertheless , these findings do not prove that the amygdala is a sufficient site of plasticity for fear memory .

12172550|A-kinase anchoring proteins in amygdala are involved in auditory fear memory . .

12172550|Here we show that the regulatory subunits of PKA are colocalized with AKAP150 -LRB- an AKAP isoform that is expressed in the brain -RRB- in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- and that infusion to the LA of the peptide St-Ht31 , which blocks PKA anchoring onto AKAPs , impairs memory consolidation of auditory fear conditioning .

12167256|It is thought that the human amygdala is a critical component of the neural substrates of emotional experience , involved particularly in the generation of fear , anxiety , and general negative affectivity .

12150768|PSA-NCAM expression in the lateral amygdala could indicate its participation in the plastic events that lead to the generation of emotional memories such as those related to fear conditioning .

12130784|Serotonin -LSB- 5 - hydroxytryptamine , -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- -RSB- function influences normal fear as well as pathological anxiety , behaviors critically dependent on the amygdala in animal models and in clinical studies .

12130784|We now report that individuals with one or two copies of the short allele of the serotonin transporter -LRB- 5-HTT -RRB- promoter polymorphism , which has been associated with reduced 5-HTT expression and function and increased fear and anxiety-related behaviors , exhibit greater amygdala neuronal activity , as assessed by BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging , in response to fearful stimuli compared with individuals homozygous for the long allele .

12130784|These results demonstrate genetically driven variation in the response of brain regions underlying human emotional behavior and suggest that differential excitability of the amygdala to emotional stimuli may contribute to the increased fear and anxiety typically associated with the short SLC6A4 allele .

12113915|Neurobiological studies have shown that the noradrenergic stress-system is involved in enhanced encoding of emotional memories , sensitization , and fear conditioning , by way of its effects on the amygdala .

12098654|Reduction of extracellular GABA in the mouse amygdala during and following confrontation with a conditioned fear stimulus . .

12098654|Our observations suggest that changes of GABAergic transmission may be involved in retrieval and expression of conditioned fear and the modulation of emotional state through the amygdala .

12094212|Most current views of amygdala function emphasize its role in negative emotions , such as fear , and in linking negative emotions with other aspects of cognition , such as learning and memory .

12094212|Indeed , the amygdala 's role in stimulus-reward learning might be just as important as its role in processing negative affect and fear conditioning .

12077219|NMDA receptors and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels contribute to long-term potentiation and different components of fear memory formation in the lateral amygdala . .

12077219|Long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- at sensory input synapses to the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is a candidate mechanism for memory storage during fear conditioning .

12077217|The group I metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR5 is required for fear memory formation and long-term potentiation in the lateral amygdala . .

12067752|Effect of lesions in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala on fear conditioning using auditory and visual conditioned stimuli in rats . .

12067752|The lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is believed to be the site of auditory conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- relay in classical fear conditioning .

12067752|These results suggest that the LA is an input site of auditory CS information into the amygdala , and that it is not a site of visual CS information input in fear conditioning .

12067752|Thus , each modality of CS may have a specific subnucleus of the amygdala that mediates fear conditioning .

12046982|The amygdala is known to be involved in the expression of emotion such as anxiety and fear , and several studies have shown that the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- is involved in morphine dependence .

12030820|Our review yielded the following summary observations : -LRB- 1 -RRB- The medial prefrontal cortex had a general role in emotional processing ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- fear specifically engaged the amygdala ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- sadness was associated with activity in the subcallosal cingulate ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- emotional induction by visual stimuli activated the occipital cortex and the amygdala ; -LRB- 5 -RRB- induction by emotional recall/imagery recruited the anterior cingulate and insula ; -LRB- 6 -RRB- emotional tasks with cognitive demand also involved the anterior cingulate and insula .

12028364|Synaptic plasticity underlying the acquisition of conditioned fear occurs in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala : long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- of synapses in the pathway of the conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- has shown to be a neural correlate of this kind of emotional learning .

12028364|Here , we explored whether mGlu5 receptors within the lateral nucleus of the amygdala are involved in the plasticity underlying fear conditioning .

12027115|Awareness that an amygdala-based fear circuit plays a crucial role in mediating fear conditioning as well as anxiety symptoms is growing .

12015233|Recognition of fear may draw especially on the amygdala and the detection of disgust may rely on the insula and basal ganglia .

12006982|CREB activation by fear conditioning and synaptic potentiation in the amygdala and cortical areas was reduced or blocked .

12000029|Furthermore , as significant advances have been made in delineating the brain areas that underlie these learned responses , we also review recent research on the contributions of the amygdala and perirhinal cortical region to olfactory and contextual fear conditioning .

11982631|The purpose of this study was to investigate amygdala-related fear and anxiety in two inbred rat lines differing in emotionality -LRB- RHA/Verh and RLA/Verh -RRB- , and to relate the behaviour of the animals to neuronal types in different nuclei of the amygdala .

11970870|Auditory information critical for fear conditioning , a model of emotional learning , is conveyed to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala via two routes : directly from the medial geniculate nucleus and indirectly from the auditory cortex .

11970870|These results indicate that the synaptic projections from the auditory cortex to the lateral amygdala are modified during the acquisition and expression of fear to auditory stimulation , thus further strengthening the proposed link between LTP in the auditory pathways to the amygdala and learned fear .

11950457|The amygdala , a brain region involved in fear and fear-related behaviors in animals , and its projections to the superior temporal gyrus -LRB- STG -RRB- , thalamus , and to the prefrontal cortex are thought to comprise the neural basis of our abilities to interpret social behaviors .

11931922|Because fear conditioning critically depends on the amygdala , a medial temporal lobe structure that frequently undergoes significant pathological changes early in the course of Alzheimer 's disease -LRB- AD -RRB- , we hypothesized that fear conditioning would be impaired in patients with mild to moderate AD .

11931922|The results indicate that fear conditioning , an amygdala-dependent form of memory , is impaired in AD .

11896173|NMDA receptor antagonists block conditioned fear extinction when injected systemically and also when infused directly into the amygdala .

11876784|However , the activation of brain centres involved in both the stress response -LRB- the parvocellular part of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus -RRB- and fear reactions -LRB- central amygdala -RRB- were markedly increased .

11876782|Because the central amygdaloid nucleus is considered an important mediator of fear responses , we compared the physiological properties of central amygdala neurons in guinea pigs , rats and cats using whole-cell recordings in coronal slices in vitro .

11860515|Rats received injections of 0 , 2.5 , 5 and 10 nmol clonidine into the lateral amygdala -LRB- i -RRB- before fear-conditioning , -LRB- ii -RRB- immediately after fear-conditioning , -LRB- iii -RRB- before testing and -LRB- iv -RRB- before both fear-conditioning and the testing of conditioned fear .

11860515|Surprisingly , both the acquisition and the expression of conditioned fear were blocked after amygdaloid injections of clonidine , suggesting that amygdaloid noradrenaline is necessary to induce both unconditioned and conditioned fear .

11854466|These latter findings imply a possible role of alpha1E-based R-type Ca2 + currents in amygdala physiology associated with fear .

11853101|In addition , intracerebroventricular administration of GLP-1 has been shown to suppress locomotor activity , and produce a neuronal activation in the amygdala , a structure involved in mechanisms of fear and anxiety .

11848722|Conditioned memory modulation , freezing , and avoidance as measures of amygdala-mediated conditioned fear . .

11848722|Three conditioned aversive responses were used to infer the existence of an unobservable central state of '' conditioned fear , '' and the roles of certain amygdala subregions in producing these responses were investigated .

11836520|Recent evidence from cerebellum-dependent motor learning and amygdala-dependent fear conditioning indicates that , despite being mediated by different brain systems , these forms of learning might use a similar sequence of events to form new memories .

11830173|The lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- provides a critical link for relaying thalamic and cortical auditory information to the rest of the amygdala during the fear conditioning process .

11830172|The role of amygdala glutamate receptors in fear learning , fear-potentiated startle , and extinction . .

11830172|Findings reviewed here suggest that amygdala N-methyl-D-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- receptors play a key role in triggering the neural changes that support fear learning and also the loss of fear that accompanies extinction training .

11830172|Very recent data indicate that glutamate metabotropic Group II receptor agonists also block fear learning when infused into the amygdala prior to training , and block fear-potentiated startle when infused prior to testing .

11830172|A fuller understanding of the role of amygdala glutamate systems in fear and fear learning may suggest novel pharmacological approaches to the treatment of clinical anxiety disorders .

11801232|The amygdala appears to be crucial for the learning of new stimulus-threat contingencies and also appears to be important in the expression of cue-specific fear .

11801227|Selective bilateral lesions of the amygdala in mature macaque monkeys result in a lack of fear responses to inanimate objects and a '' socially uninhibited '' pattern of behavior .

11792399|These data indicate that the amygdala supports both the specific apprehension of fear in faces and face recognition in adult human females , but that the association may not hold for men .

11790378|Enhancement of delayed release of dopamine in the amygdala induced by conditioned fear stress in methamphetamine-sensitized rats . .

11790378|Behavior during conditioned fear stress , a form of psychological stress , and the release of dopamine in the amygdala were measured over time using methamphetamine-sensitized rats , which are considered to be a model of hypersensitivity and vulnerability to emotional stress associated with stimulant-induced psychosis and schizophrenia .

11790378|Dopamine release in the amygdala showed a delayed increase following completion of freezing behavior induced by conditioned fear stress regardless of the presence or absence of methamphetamine-sensitization .

11790378|The above results suggested that delayed dopamine release in the amygdala is a phenomenon strongly associated with the emotional context of conditioned fear stress , and hypersensitivity and vulnerability to stress are at least partially involved with the overreaction to stress .

11770057|Patterns of Fos expression in the amygdala and ventral perirhinal cortex induced by training in an olfactory fear conditioning paradigm . .

11770057|The activation of amygdaloid nuclei , the ventral perirhinal cortex -LRB- vPRh -RRB- , and several other brain areas in the rat during the acquisition and expression of olfactory fear conditioning was assessed through Fos immunocytochemistry in 3 separate experiments .

11739592|Visual pathways to the amygdala , a brain structure critical for classical fear conditioning , were investigated .

11739592|These results suggest that , during classical fear conditioning , a visual stimulus can be transmitted to the amygdala via either lemniscal -LRB- i.e. , LG -- > V1 , V2 -- > TE2/PR -RRB- or non-lemniscal -LRB- i.e. , LP -- > V2 , TE2/PR -RRB- thalamo-cortico-amygdala pathways , or direct thalamo-amygdala -LRB- i.e. , LP -- > L -RRB- projections .

11727217|The relation of the amygdaloid body with the emotions has been based on the study of the conditioning of fear , by which an emotionally neutral stimulus can cause emotional reactions due to its temporal association with an adverse stimulus .

11726237|Is there savings for pavlovian fear conditioning after neurotoxic basolateral amygdala lesions in rats ? .

11726237|Considerable evidence indicates an important role for amygdaloid nuclei in both the acquisition and expression of Pavlovian fear conditioning .

11722614|Histamine H3 receptor-mediated impairment of contextual fear conditioning and in-vivo inhibition of cholinergic transmission in the rat basolateral amygdala . .

11722614|We investigated the effects of agents acting at histamine receptors on both , spontaneous release of ACh from the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- of freely moving rats , and fear conditioning .

11722614|These observations provide the first evidence that histamine receptors are involved in the modulation of cholinergic tone in the amygdala and in the consolidation of fear conditioning .

11716820|These data indicate that infusion of muscimol into the amygdala can block the acquisition and expression of conditioned defeat , a finding that indicates that GABAergic neurotransmission within the amygdala is involved in the acquisition and expression of fear or stress-induced behavioral changes .

11704261|However , in line with the strong interconnectivity of the ventral hippocampus with amygdala and nucleus accumbens , more recent studies indicated an even more global role for the ventral hippocampus in fear conditioning .

11704261|However , strong stimulation of the ventral hippocampus might also disrupt fear conditioning by interfering with processes in the projection areas of the ventral hippocampus , such as the amygdala or the nucleus accumbens .

11704071|The amygdala has a central role in processing emotions , particularly fear .

11701135|Potentiated amygdaloid auditory-evoked potentials and freezing behavior after fear conditioning in mice . .

11701135|As a first step to this goal , we implanted adult C57BL/6J mice with recording electrodes aimed at the basolateral amygdaloid complex and trained them in an auditory fear conditioning paradigm .

11697938|Arousal dissociates amygdala and hippocampal fear responses : evidence from simultaneous fMRI and skin conductance recording . .

11697938|Lesion evidence suggests that the subjective experience of fear relies upon amygdala-medial frontal activity -LRB- as well as autonomic arousal -RRB- , whereas the factual context of threat stimuli depends upon hippocampal-lateral frontal activity .

11697938|The findings provide direct evidence for a dissociation between human amygdala and hippocampus networks in the visceral experience versus declarative fact processing of fear .

11682152|Increased social fear and decreased fear of objects in monkeys with neonatal amygdala lesions . .

11682152|These results suggest that neonatal amygdala lesions dissociate a system that mediates social fear from one that mediates fear of inanimate objects .

11588195|Because our amygdala-lesioned monkeys exhibited both a reduction in antinociception and a reduction in behavioral indices of fear -LRB- Emery et al. , 2001 -RRB- , the possibility should be considered that , in the primate , '' antinociceptive circuitry '' and '' fear circuitry '' overlap at the level of the amygdala .

11584069|Synaptic plasticity in the lateral amygdala : a cellular hypothesis of fear conditioning . .

11567621|A role for the PI-3 kinase signaling pathway in fear conditioning and synaptic plasticity in the amygdala . .

11567607|In this issue of Neuron , Gean and colleagues report the discovery that the PI-3 kinase/AKT -LRB- PKB -RRB- pathway contributes to LTP and the consolidation of amygdala-dependent cued fear conditioning in rats .

11566217|Neuroanatomical and behavioral studies have demonstrated that the amygdaloid complex is an essential component of the neural pathways mediating behaviors , such as fear , anxiety , learning , and memory .

11533224|Identification of genes expressed in the amygdala during the formation of fear memory . .

11533224|In this study we describe changes of gene expression that occur in the basolateral complex of the mouse amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- during the formation of fear memory .

11533224|Through the combination of a behavioral training scheme with polymerase chain reaction-based expression analysis -LRB- subtractive hybridization and virtual Northern analysis -RRB- we were able to identify various gene products that are increased in expression after Pavlovian fear conditioning and are of potential significance for neural plasticity and information storage in the amygdala .

11517276|The lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is an essential component of the neural circuitry underlying Pavlovian fear conditioning .

11506888|Collectively , these findings suggest that fear memory consolidation in the amygdala shares essential biochemical features with LTP , and hold promise for understanding the relationship between memory consolidation and synaptic plasticity in the mammalian brain .

11495097|Functional neuroimaging symptom provocation and cognitive activation paradigms using PET measurement of regional cerebral blood flow have revealed greater activation of the amygdala and anterior paralimbic structures -LRB- which are known to be involved in processing negative emotions such as fear -RRB- , greater deactivation of Broca 's region -LRB- motor speech -RRB- and other nonlimbic cortical regions , and failure of activation of the cingulate cortex -LRB- which possibly plays an inhibitory role -RRB- in response to trauma-related stimuli in individuals with PTSD .

11493699|By using event-related functional MRI , that crossed sensory modality -LRB- visual or auditory -RRB- with emotional expression -LRB- fearful or happy -RRB- , we show that perceptual facilitation during face fear processing is expressed through modulation of neuronal responses in the amygdala and the fusiform cortex .

11493699|These data suggest that the amygdala is important for emotional crossmodal sensory convergence with the associated perceptual bias during fear processing , being mediated by task-related modulation of face-processing regions of fusiform cortex .

11482842|However , the ventral hippocampus has intimate connections with the amygdala and the nucleus accumbens , which are involved in classical fear conditioning to explicit and contextual cues .

11473133|Here , we evaluate the role of MAPK within the basolateral amygdala in the extinction of conditioned fear .

11473133|These results suggest that a MAPK-dependent signaling cascade within or very near the basolateral amygdala plays an important role in the extinction of conditioned fear .

11470034|Just as psychobiologic models of panic disorder and post - traumatic stress disorder have been strengthened by the inclusion of preclinical work on amygdala-mediated fear conditioning , so findings on disgust and its mediating CSTC circuits may generate useful hypotheses for OCD research .

11466423|In sharp contrast , amygdala-dependent cued fear conditioning remains intact .

11426229|Single-cell activity was recorded in the dorsal subnucleus of the lateral amygdala -LRB- LAd -RRB- of freely behaving rats during Pavlovian fear conditioning , to determine the relationship between neuronal activity and behavioral learning .

11417461|Embedded within contemporary views of emotional learning is a well-founded agreement that the amygdala plays a pivotal role in the formation and consolidation of aversive memories formed during fear conditioning .

11417461|Within the neurobiology of learning and memory literature , there is an ongoing debate concerning the potential role of the amygdala in the performance of unconditioned fear responses .

11417461|A view put forth by Vazdarjanova and McGaugh -LRB- 1998 -RRB- suggests that the amygdala is not required for the formation and consolidation of the aversive memories formed during fear conditioning , but is essential in the performance of unconditioned fear responses .

11417461|Data provided by Maren -LRB- 1999 -RRB- counter this view by positing that the amygdala is not required for the performance of fear responses , but its role is of a mnemonic nature in the conditioning of fear to neutral cues .

11417461|To clarify the amygdala 's participation in these two processes , a useful approach would involve a situation where animals with amygdala damage were examined for their unconditioned fear responses in reaction to footshock as well as the conditioning of these reactions to previously neutral cues paired with the aversive event .

11417461|We have previously reported that rats with amygdala or hippocampal damage are impaired in discriminative fear conditioning to context .

11417461|The impairment of discriminative fear conditioning to context , in combination with the present experiment , represents a dissociation where damage to specific memory structures -LRB- amygdala or hippocampus -RRB- debilitates the mnemonic processes involved in fear conditioning , but not the performance of the fear responses per se .

11390635|Damage to the lateral and central , but not other , amygdaloid nuclei prevents the acquisition of auditory fear conditioning . .

11390635|It is well established that the amygdala plays an essential role in Pavlovian fear conditioning , with the lateral nucleus serving as the interface with sensory systems that transmit the conditioned stimulus and the central nucleus as the link with motor regions that control conditioned fear responses .

11390634|Contextual and auditory fear conditioning are mediated by the lateral , basal , and central amygdaloid nuclei in rats . .

11390634|A large body of literature implicates the amygdala in Pavlovian fear conditioning .

11390634|In this study , we examined the contribution of individual amygdaloid nuclei to contextual and auditory fear conditioning in rats .

11390634|Prior to fear conditioning , rats received a large electrolytic lesion of the amygdala in one hemisphere , and a nucleus-specific neurotoxic lesion in the contralateral hemisphere .

11390634|These results indicate that there is significant overlap within the amygdala in the neural pathways mediating fear conditioning to contextual and acoustic CS , and that these forms of learning are not anatomically dissociable at the level of amygdaloid nuclei .

11380577|Possible mechanisms include the role of the amygdala in fear conditioning , the concepts of forced normalization , and kindling .

11356900|There is conflicting evidence regarding the issue of whether NMDA receptors in the basolateral amygdalar complex -LRB- BLA -RRB- are critically involved in the expression of conditioned fear .

11356899|NMDA receptors within the amygdala play an important role in the acquisition and expression of conditioned fear .

11356899|Because amygdaloid injections of NMDA receptor antagonists did not block the expression of every behavioral sign of fear , a discussion arose as to whether amygdaloid NMDA receptors play different roles in different kinds of fear-conditioning tasks .

11356899|To clarify the exact role of amygdaloid NMDA receptors , the present study measured the effects of amygdaloid NMDA receptor blockade on the two major animal models of conditioned fear .

11356899|The present study clearly demonstrates that injections of the NMDA receptor antagonist AP-5 into the lateral nucleus of the amygdala significantly attenuated both behavioral fear responses -LRB- i.e. , the amygdaloid NMDA receptors are necessary for the expression of fear-potentiated startle and freezing -RRB- .

11356899|It appears then that NMDA receptor antagonists may block the acquisition of fear conditioning by directly interfering with normal synaptic transmissions in the amygdala .

11331391|Neurotoxic lesions of the lateral nucleus of the amygdala decrease conditioned fear but not unconditioned fear of a predator odor : comparison with electrolytic lesions . .

11331391|Recent arguments , however , have seriously challenged this view , suggesting that the effects of amygdala lesions are attributable to interference with performance of fear behavior and not learning and memory .

11352610|Parallel neural responses in amygdala subregions and sensory cortex during implicit fear conditioning . .

11349391|The amygdala has also been associated with the processing of facial expressions of emotion , particularly those of fear and sadness .

Davis -LRB- 1999 -RRB- recently reported that combined lesions of the posterior extension of the intralaminar complex -LRB- PINT -RRB- and caudal insular cortex -LRB- INS -RRB- block acquisition but not expression of fear-potentiated startle to discrete conditioned stimuli -LRB- CSs -RRB- and a footshock unconditioned stimulus -LRB- US -RRB- and proposed that PINT-INS projections to the amygdala constitute the essential US pathways involved in fear conditioning .

11330199|The amygdala plays a central role in fear conditioning , a model of anticipatory anxiety .

11330199|The results suggest that fear , most likely involving the amygdala , can influence REM and brainstem alerting mechanisms .

11311883|To assess the role of amygdaloid DA D -LRB- 2 -RRB- receptors in aversive emotionality , the D -LRB- 2 -RRB- receptor antagonist raclopride was infused into the amygdala prior to Pavlovian fear conditioning .

11311883|Depending on dose , the results found conditioned fear acquisition and retention to be impaired following administration of raclopride into the amygdala .

11311883|These findings further refine the known neural mechanisms of amygdala-based emotional learning and memory and were interpreted to suggest that , along with D -LRB- 1 -RRB- receptors , D -LRB- 2 -RRB- receptors in the amygdala may mediate the formation and the retention of newly-acquired fear associations .

11298807|Here , using immunocytochemistry , we investigated the molecular basis of this process in the rat and show that retrieval of a cued fear memory induces the activation , by phosphorylation , of the transcription factor CREB within the basal and lateral nuclei of the amygdala , as well as expression of the CREB-regulated immediate-early gene , c-fos , in the basal amygdala .

11290392|The present study determined effects of acute and repeated restraint on CRH-BP mRNA in basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and dorsal hippocampus -LRB- DH -RRB- , brain regions involved in fear and motivation .

11276236|Activation of the left amygdala to a cognitive representation of fear . .

11276236|Using functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- , activation of the left amygdala was observed in response to threat versus safe conditions , which correlated with the expression of the fear response as measured by skin conductance .

11276236|Additional activation observed in the insular cortex is proposed to be involved in conveying a cortical representation of fear to the amygdala .

11273416|In particular , recent studies have shown that damage to the human amygdala impairs the normal appraisal of social signals of emotion , primarily those of fear .

11273416|We report a case study of a patient with bilateral amygdaloid damage who , despite a severe deficit in interpreting facial expressions of emotion including fear , exhibits an intact ability to express this and other basic emotions .

11264314|Increasing CREB levels specifically in the basolateral amygdala via viral vector-mediated gene transfer significantly increases LTM after massed fear training .

11264314|These results suggest that CREB activity in the amygdala serves as a molecular switch for the formation of LTM in fear conditioning .

11245704|The amygdala is essential for the development of neuronal plasticity in the medial geniculate nucleus during auditory fear conditioning in rats . .

11245704|The medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus -LRB- MGN -RRB- and the basolateral complex of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- are critical components of the neural circuit that mediates auditory fear conditioning .

11245703|Cellular imaging of zif268 expression in the hippocampus and amygdala during contextual and cued fear memory retrieval : selective activation of hippocampal CA1 neurons during the recall of contextual memories . .

11245703|Cellular quantitative in situ hybridization revealed that zif268 is expressed within specific regions of the hippocampus and amygdala during fear memory retrieval .

11245703|In contrast , zif268 expression was increased within neurons of the amygdala -LRB- lateral , basal , and central nuclei -RRB- during the retrieval of both contextual and cued fear memories .

11245690|The primate amygdala mediates acute fear but not the behavioral and physiological components of anxious temperament . .

11245690|These findings demonstrate that the primate amygdala is involved in mediating some acute unconditioned fear responses but challenge the notion that the amygdala is the key structure underlying the dispositional behavioral and physiological characteristics of anxious temperament .

11244481|Here we provide a review of the animal and human literature concerning the role of the amygdala in fear conditioning , considering its potential influence over autonomic and hormonal changes , motor behavior and attentional processes .

11244481|A stimulus that predicts an aversive outcome will change neural transmission in the amygdala to produce the somatic , autonomic and endocrine signs of fear , as well as increased attention to that stimulus .

11241871|Despite the many studies highlighting the role of the amygdala in fear perception , few have examined differences between right and left amygdalar responses .

11222057|Calcitonin gene-related peptide released within the amygdala is involved in Pavlovian auditory fear conditioning . .

11222057|The effects of CGRP and the CGRP receptor antagonist hCGRP -LRB- 8-37 -RRB- injected into the amygdala on both the acquisition and expression of fear behavior to a discrete auditory conditional stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- and the training context were assessed .

11222057|These data suggest that CGRP in the amygdala may selectively contribute to the expression of learning about auditory stimuli during fear conditioning .

11209954|In contrast , the left amygdala was significantly more activated than the right to the contrast of fear vs happy .

11182538|These data suggest that the punished drinking test and the elevated plus-maze may activate different components of fear circuitry , and that the serotonergic input to the amygdala specifically participates in fear-related behavioral suppression mediated by this structure .

11182248|N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonism blocks contextual fear conditioning and differentially regulates early growth response-1 messenger RNA expression in the amygdala : implications for a functional amygdaloid circuit of fear . .

11182248|N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors in the amygdala are known to be crucial for the learning of conditioned fear , although the molecular cascades that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors regulate are not well understood .

11182248|Recent experiments from our laboratory have shown that messenger RNA expression of the immediate-early messenger gene , early growth response gene 1 , increases in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala following contextual fear conditioning .

11182248|To determine if N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors regulate both fear conditioning and the increase in early growth response gene 1 expression in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala , rats were infused i.c.v. with 2.5 microg of the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist , DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate .

11182248|The results reveal differential regulation of early growth response gene 1 messenger RNA in the amygdala by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and argue for a functional role of early growth response gene 1 in the formation of long-term memory for contextual fear .

11182248|Furthermore , the results indicate a functional neuroanatomical circuit within the amygdala that includes dampening of excitatory and activation of inhibitory processes in distinct amygdala nuclei , resulting in the reduction of fear conditioning .

11173084|The effects of R -LRB- + -RRB- -8 - hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin -LRB- 8-OHDPAT -RRB- administration into the dorsal raphe nucleus -LRB- DRN -RRB- or bilaterally into the dorsal hippocampus -LRB- HIP -RRB- on fear behavior in a modified version of the light-dark transitions test and regional brain monoamines -LRB- NA , DA , 5-HT -RRB- and their metabolites -LRB- MHPG , DOPAC , 5-HIAA -RRB- in the hypothalamus , midbrain central gray matter , amygdala , hippocampus and pons were examined .

11166694|Rats with bilateral lesions of the amygdala or the cerebellar interpositus or intact rats were subjected to a fear conditioning session followed by four eyeblink conditioning sessions .

10753976|Differential fear conditioning induces reciprocal changes in the sensory responses of lateral amygdala neurons to the CS -LRB- + -RRB- and CS -LRB- - -RRB- . .

10753976|As amygdala lesions prevent the acquisition of fear responses and the lateral amygdaloid -LRB- LA -RRB- nucleus is the main input station of the amygdala for auditory afferents , the effect of auditory fear conditioning on the sensory responsiveness of LA neurons has been examined .

10753976|Such changes have never been observed in the amygdala except in cases where the CS -LRB- - -RRB- had been paired to the US before and fear responses not extinguished .

10753800|Recent event-related fMRI and PET studies are adding crucial data to the current discussion about the putative role of the amygdala in classical fear conditioning in humans .

10751426|These changes were reflected by abnormal alpha subunit expression in the amygdala and hippocampus , two important limbic regions involved in fear and anxiety .

11142635|Involvement of NMDA receptors within the amygdala in short - versus long-term memory for fear conditioning as assessed with fear-potentiated startle . .

11142635|Thus , amygdala NMDA receptors appear to participate in the initial acquisition of fear memories .

11122357|The contribution of the nucleus accumbens shell , the dorsal hippocampus , and the basolateral amygdala to contextual and explicit cue fear conditioning was assessed in C57BL/6 -LRB- C57 -RRB- and DBA/2 -LRB- DBA -RRB- mice showing differences in processing contextual information associated with consistent but non-pathological variations in hippocampal functionality .

11122357|In C57 , both nucleus accumbens and hippocampal lesions impaired acquisition of contextual fear conditioning but paradoxically improved acquisition of cue fear conditioning , whereas amygdala lesions disrupted performance in every task .

11122357|In DBA , nucleus accumbens lesions , like amygdala lesions , impaired acquisition of both contextual and cue fear conditioning , whereas hippocampal lesions did not produce any effect .

11122351|Generally , these effects were more pronounced in Fast rats , and norepinephrine utilization in the central amygdala was particularly highlighted in response to a conditioned fear stimulus .

11069601|Auditory fear conditioning increases CS-elicited spike firing in lateral amygdala neurons even after extensive overtraining . .

11069601|We examined the influence of extensive overtraining -LRB- 75 trials -RRB- of auditory fear conditioning on the expression of conditional stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- - elicited spike firing in lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- neurons .

11069601|These results complement amygdala lesion studies -LSB- e.g. Maren , S. -LRB- 1999a -RRB- J. Neurosci. , 19 , 8696-8703 -RSB- and support the view that the basolateral complex of the amygdala is involved in the encoding and storage of fear memories even after extensive overtraining .

11050141|Activation of ERK/MAP kinase in the amygdala is required for memory consolidation of pavlovian fear conditioning . .

11050141|The present experiments evaluated the role of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase -LRB- ERK/MAPK -RRB- signaling cascade in the amygdala during Pavlovian fear conditioning .

11050141|Collectively , these results demonstrate that ERK/MAPK activation is necessary for both memory consolidation of Pavlovian fear conditioning and synaptic plasticity in the amygdala .

11038248|Expression of the immediate-early gene , NGFI-B -LRB- nerve growth factor inducible gene B -RRB- , was examined in the amygdala , hippocampus , and neocortex following contextual fear conditioning .

11033344|Taken together , these findings suggest that the increased release of noradrenaline in the hypothalamus , amygdala and locus coeruleus is , in part , involved in the provocation of anxiety and/or fear in animals exposed to stress , and that the attenuation of this increase by benzodiazepine anxiolytics acting via the benzodiazepine receptor/GABAA receptor/chloride ionophore supramolecular complex may be the basic mechanism of action of these anxiolytic drugs .

11022139|We present a patient with stereotactically proven right amygdalar seizure onset , associated with fear and vegetative autonomic signs and symptoms as the most prominent clinical ictal features .

11016075|The effects of bicuculline methiodide administration into ventromedial hypothalamus -LRB- 15 ng per site , bilaterally -RRB- on fear behavior and monoamines -LRB- NA , DA , 5-HT -RRB- and GABA in structures of the brain defensive system -LRB- hypothalamus , midbrain gray matter , amygdala , hippocampus and frontal cortex -RRB- were studied .

11011014|The amygdala is important in processing emotion and in the acquisition and expression of fear and anxiety .

11006968|We find that people with high-functioning autism -LRB- HFA -RRB- show neuropsychological profiles characteristic of the effects of amygdala damage , in particular selective impairment in the recognition of facial expressions of fear , perception of eye-gaze direction , and recognition memory for faces .

10998114|Close linkage between calcium/calmodulin kinase II alpha/beta and NMDA-2A receptors in the lateral amygdala and significance for retrieval of auditory fear conditioning . .

10998114|Lesions of the lateral/basolateral nuclei of the amygdala result in the selective impairment of fear conditioning , indicating that this is a key region for this type of learning .

10998114|In addition , recent results from several laboratories suggest that N-methyl-D-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- receptor activation in the amygdala is required for the acquisition and expression of cue-conditioned fear responses using several kinds of antagonists .

10998114|Here we use NMDA receptor-deficient mice to demonstrate that calmodulin-dependent kinase II , CaMKIIbeta , and CaMKIIalpha activation involves the NR2A subunit in the lateral/basolateral amygdala during memory retrieval following auditory fear conditioning .

10997609|Thus , CRH and the LC/NE system stimulate arousal and attention , as well as the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system , which is involved in anticipatory and reward phenomena , and the amygdala , which are responsible for the generation of fear .

10996055|A role for amygdaloid PKA and PKC in the acquisition of long-term conditional fear memories in rats . .

10996055|Although there is great interest in the cellular mechanisms underlying Pavlovian conditioning , few studies have directly examined the contribution of intracellular signaling pathways in the amygdala to the acquisition and expression of conditional fear memories .

10996055|In the present study , we examined this issue by infusing 1 - -LRB- 5 ' - isoquinolinesulfonyl -RRB- -2 - methylpiperazine -LRB- H7 -RRB- , a potent inhibitor of both protein kinase C -LRB- PKC -RRB- and cAMP-dependent protein kinase -LRB- PKA -RRB- , directly into the amygdala prior to fear conditioning or retention testing .

10996055|The contribution of protein kinases to conditional fear was region-specific within the amygdala : infusion of H7 into the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- but not the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CEA -RRB- resulted in attenuated freezing -LRB- Experiment 2 -RRB- .

10996055|Together , these experiments suggest that amygdaloid PKA and PKC play an important role in the acquisition of fear memories .

10995852|The amygdala modulates memory consolidation of fear-motivated inhibitory avoidance learning but not classical fear conditioning . .

10995852|Although the lateral and basal nuclei of the amygdala are believed to be essential for the acquisition of Pavlovian fear conditioning , studies using post-training manipulations of the amygdala in the inhibitory avoidance learning paradigm have recently called this view into question .

10995852|These findings indicate that the amygdala plays an essential role in the acquisition of Pavlovian fear conditioning and contributes to the modulation of memory consolidation of inhibitory avoidance but not of Pavlovian fear conditioning .

10974093|Memory consolidation of auditory pavlovian fear conditioning requires protein synthesis and protein kinase A in the amygdala . .

10974093|Previous studies have shown that long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- can be induced in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- after stimulation of central auditory pathways and that auditory fear conditioning modifies neural activity in the LA in a manner similar to LTP .

10971645|The basolateral amygdala complex is involved with , but is not necessary for , rapid acquisition of Pavlovian ` fear conditioning ' . .

10971645|A major hypothesis about lateral/basolateral amygdala complex -LRB- BLC -RRB- function in memory proposes that the BLC is the site where conditioned stimulus-unconditioned stimulus -LRB- CS-US -RRB- associations are formed and permanently stored during Pavlovian ` fear conditioning . '

10964936|The lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is thought to be critical for the specific acquisition of conditioned fear , and the emotionally charged memories related to fear are thought to require a form of synaptic plasticity related to long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- .

10963596|The lateral and basal nuclei of the amygdala -LRB- LBA -RRB- are believed to be a site of memory storage in fear learning .

10959526|Associative fear conditioning of enkephalin mRNA levels in central amygdalar neurons . .

10959526|The central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CEA -RRB- is required for the expression of learned fear responses .

10959526|Conditioned neuropeptide levels in amygdalar circuits may act as a reversible '' gain control '' for long-term modulation of subsequent fear responses .

10913507|Basic research has implicated the amygdala and circuits related to these nuclei as being central to several aspects of fear and fear-related behaviors in animals .

10890308|The aim of the present review is to provide an overview of the effects of different acute and repeated/chronic stressors on serotonin -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- release and reuptake , extracellular 5-HT levels , and 5-HT pre - and postsynaptic receptors in areas tightly linked to the control of fear and anxiety , namely the dorsal and median raphe nuclei , the frontal cortex , the amygdala and the hippocampus .

10883814|In conclusion , these results suggest that amygdaloid dopamine transmission at D2 receptors contributes to the formation and/or consolidation of fear memories .

10855761|The role of the amygdala in attention and fear conditioning suggests that increased amygdala rCBF may be related to clinical features of PTSD .

10845062|This work has pinpointed the amygdala as an important component of the system involved in the acquisition , storage , and expression of fear memory and has elucidated in detail how stimuli enter , travel through , and exit the amygdala .

10842014|Specific induction of early growth response gene 1 in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala following contextual fear conditioning in rats . .

10842014|Although the amygdala is known to be crucial for fear conditioning , little is known about the molecular and cellular mechanisms in the amygdala that are important for fear conditioning .

10842014|Image analysis of in situ hybridization of messenger RNA of the four family members was performed in the amygdala , hippocampus , and neocortex 15 , 30 and 60min following one-trial contextual fear conditioning .

10842014|The increased expression of EGR-1 was specifically localized to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala ; expression in the hippocampus and cortex was not increased by fear conditioning .

10842014|In contrast , the expression of EGR-2 , EGR-3 , and EGR-4 messenger RNA was not increased in the amygdala , hippocampus or cortex following fear conditioning .

10842014|In addition , following a retention test conducted 24h after fear conditioning , no increases were found in the expression of EGR-1 messenger RNA expression in the amygdala , hippocampus or cortex .

10842014|The results demonstrate that of the four genes of the EGR family of transcription-regulatory factors , only EGR-1 messenger RNA in the dorsolateral portion of the lateral nucleus of the amygdala was specifically increased with contextual fear conditioning .

10842014|It is suggested that EGR-1 plays a functional role during learning , but not retrieval , of contextual fear within the lateral nucleus of the amygdala .

10802309|There is now substantial evidence suggesting that many aspects of conditioned fear depend critically upon the integrity of the amygdala and the perirhinal cortex .

10802309|Recent studies in our laboratory examining the contributions of these areas to olfactory and contextual fear conditioning are reviewed ; collectively the results of these studies suggest that the amygdala participates critically in the acquisition and expression of fear conditioned to both an olfactory conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- and to the training context , while the perirhinal cortex contributes to olfactory , but not contextual , fear conditioning .

10793199|TMT , but not conditioned fear , activated dopamine metabolism in the amygdala , but not the nucleus accumbens core and shell .

10792055|Our studies show that the Syt IV mutation disrupts contextual fear conditioning , a learning task sensitive to hippocampal and amygdala lesions .

10792055|In contrast , cued fear conditioning is normal in the Syt IV mutants , suggesting that this mutation did not disrupt amygdala function .

10739407|In animals , these responses are mediated by a '' fear network '' in the brain that is centered in the amygdala and involves its interaction with the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex .

10739407|Projections from the amygdala to hypothalamic and brainstem sites explain many of the observed signs of conditioned fear responses .

10739407|Medications , particularly those that influence the serotonin system , are hypothesized to desensitize the fear network from the level of the amygdala through its projects to the hypothalamus and the brainstem .

10729357|Although conditioned fear has been shown to involve mechanisms of synaptic plasticity in the amygdala , the association with afferent input systems is not yet clear .

10729351|Neuronal correlates of fear in the lateral amygdala : multiple extracellular recordings in conscious cats . .

10729351|Much data implicates the amygdala in the expression and learning of fear .

10729351|Yet , few studies have examined the neuronal correlates of fear in the amygdala .

10729351|This study aimed to determine whether fear is correlated to particular activity patterns in the lateral amygdaloid -LRB- LA -RRB- nucleus .

10727623|Differential expression of EGR-1 mRNA in the amygdala following diazepam in contextual fear conditioning . .

10727623|To investigate whether activity in the amygdaloid complex is altered with anxiolytic effects of diazepam , mRNA expression of the immediate-early gene EGR-1 was examined in the amygdala following blockade of fear conditioning by diazepam .

10727623|It was previously shown that mRNA expression of EGR-1 -LRB- also called , NGFI-A , Zif 268 , Krox 24 -RRB- increases in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- shortly following contextual fear conditioning .

10721680|Bilateral amygdala damage in humans can compromise the recognition of fear in facial expressions , an important ability in social judgement .

10716205|Functional neuroimaging experiments have shown that recognition of emotional expressions does not depend on awareness of visual stimuli and that unseen fear stimuli can activate the amygdala via a colliculopulvinar pathway .

10704753|First studies indicate a link between amygdala atrophy , fear and aggression and between amygdala hypertrophy and depression .

10693814|People with brain injuries involving the amygdala are often poor at recognizing facial expressions of fear , but the extent to which this impairment compromises other signals of the emotion of fear has not been clearly established .

10693814|We investigated N.M. , a person with bilateral amygdala damage and a left thalamic lesion , who was impaired at recognizing fear from facial expressions .

10688157|They categorised disgust as either anger or fear more frequently than paranoids , and demonstrated in response to disgust expressions activation in the amygdala , a region associated with perception of fearful faces .

10683827|Matching angry or frightened expressions was associated with increased regional cerebral blood flow -LRB- rCBF -RRB- in the left and right amygdala , the brain 's primary fear centers .

10683111|Learned visual association with the target -LRB- bead -RRB- occurs in the IMHV and is relayed to the basal ganglia via the limbic archistriatum -LRB- amygdala equivalent -RRB- , the latter introducing a motivational element -LRB- aversion , fear -RRB- .

10682714|This study provides direct evidence that the projection from the central nucleus of the amygdala to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray is activated during fear and that it contributes to the Fos response of the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray .

10680785|Previous studies have suggested that the perception of fear in facial expressions is mediated by a specialized neural system that includes the amygdala and certain posterior right-hemisphere cortical regions .

10680785|However , the neuropsychological findings in patients with amygdala damage are inconclusive , and the contribution of distinct cortical regions to fear perception has only been examined in one study .

10680785|The proposed special role of the amygdala and posterior right-hemisphere cortical regions in fear perception was also not supported .

10680753|With the use of a discriminative paradigm and the assessment of multiple measures of fear , results indicate that the amygdala is a memory structure that selectively mediates the conditioning of heart rate , and the hippocampus selectively mediates the conditioning of defecation and body temperature .

10680753|The proposed view ascribes an equal role in fear conditioning to both the amygdala and the hippocampus .

10651899|The amygdala is considered to be a core component of the brain 's fear system .

10643044|-LSB- Effects of lesions in the central nucleus and lateral nucleus of the amygdala on fear conditioning with a visual conditioned stimulus in rats -RSB- . .

10643044|Lesions in the central nucleus or lateral nucleus of the amygdala have been known to interfere with the acquisition of fear conditioning when a sound is used as a conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- .

10643044|These results suggest that the lateral nucleus of the amygdala may not be involved in fear conditioning to a visual CS .

10643044|It is possible that each modality of CS has a specific pathway to the central nucleus of the amygdala to mediate fear conditioning .

10638633|These results suggest that the trait anxiety -LRB- neophobia -RRB- that characterizes BALB/c mice could be due , at least in part , to a genetic modulation of benzodiazepine receptor expression in the amygdala , a structure known to be strongly involved in fear behavior .

10629757|A large body of evidence suggest that CRH in the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CEA -RRB- induces fear-related behaviors and is essential to fear conditioning ; however , evidence of CRH-mediated activation of the amygdala under physiological situation is still limited .

11124979|Indeed , they receive glutamatergic sensory inputs from the basolateral amygdaloid complex and generate feedforward inhibition in neurons of the central amygdala that mediate important components of fear responses .

11124977|An animal model most sensitive for measuring anticipatory anxiety is fear conditioning , which is expressed by an enduring increase in synaptic strength in the amygdala .

10595427|In the present study , the implication of the amygdala , a key structure in mechanisms of fear and anxiety , was investigated as a potential neural substrate for the effects of neurosteroids on anxiety-like behavior in rat .

10594668|Relative to controls , monkeys with neurotoxic amygdala lesions showed the same array of behavioural changes as those with aspiration lesions , i.e. reduced fear and aggression , increased submission , and excessive manual and oral exploration .

10594668|Even partial neurotoxic lesions involving less than two-thirds of the amygdala significantly altered fear and manual exploration .

10594092|Functional inactivation of the amygdala before but not after auditory fear conditioning prevents memory formation . .

10594092|Two competing theories predict different effects on memory consolidation when the amygdala is inactivated after fear conditioning .

10594092|One theory , based on studies using inhibitory avoidance training , proposes that the amygdala modulates the strength of fear learning , and post-training amygdala manipulations interfere with memory consolidation .

10594092|The other , based on studies using Pavlovian fear conditioning , hypothesizes that fear learning occurs in the amygdala , and post-training manipulations after acquisition will not affect memory consolidation .

10594092|We infused the GABAA agonist muscimol -LRB- 4.4 nmol/side -RRB- or vehicle into lateral and basal amygdala -LRB- LBA -RRB- of rats either before or immediately after tone-foot shock Pavlovian fear conditioning .

10587090|Using rat brain slices and whole-cell recordings this study aimed to examine the roles of GABA -LRB- B -RRB- receptors in synaptic interactions in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , a critical brain structure related to fear and anxiety .

10583480|Previous experiments using a classical fear conditioning paradigm have provided evidence that the processing of contextual conditional stimuli -LRB- CSs -RRB- by the hippocampus would be controlled by the amygdala through a modulation of hippocampal-lateral septal -LRB- H-LS -RRB- excitability .

10580500|The amygdala modulates prefrontal cortex activity relative to conditioned fear . .

10580500|Studies using amygdalectomized rats have shown that the amygdala is required for both the acquisition and expression of learned fear responses .

10580500|These data indicate that , in the presence of threatening stimuli , the amygdala controls both fear expression and prefrontal neuronal activity .

10579563|The amygdala is a complex forebrain structure proposed to play a pivotal role in fear conditioning circuitry .

10575053|The central amygdaloid nucleus projects to brainstem and hypothalamic nuclei mediating fear responses and receives convergent sensory inputs from the basolateral amygdaloid complex .

10575047|Long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- in the amygdala is a leading candidate mechanism to explain fear conditioning , a prominent model of emotional memory .

10575047|LTP occurs in the pathway from the auditory thalamus to the lateral amygdala , and during fear conditioning LTP-like changes occur in the synapses of this pathway .

10571476|In contrast , an infusion of bupivacaine into the amygdala impaired the acquisition and the expression of fear responses to both the CS and the context .

10571473|A second-order fear-conditioning paradigm was used to test whether the dopaminergic projection from the ventral tegmental area -LRB- VTA -RRB- to the lateral and basal amygdala -LRB- LBA -RRB- can affect conditioned fear .

10559431|Enhanced amygdala kindling after electrical stimulation of the ventral tegmental area : implications for fear and anxiety . .

10559431|Dopamine-containing ventral tegmental area -LRB- VTA -RRB- neurons , known to be activated by threatening environmental stimuli , are an important component of the amygdala-based fear network .

10559431|By establishing a fundamental link between VTA activation and neural excitability in the central amygdala , the present results are consistent with the possibility of a common process underlying epileptogenisis and the fear motivational consequences of amygdala and VTA kindling .

10559379|The amygdala is intimately involved in emotional behavior , and its role in the generation of anxiety and conditioned fear is well known .

10542437|Compelling new evidence for this view derives from studies of LTP in the amygdala , a brain structure that is essential for simple forms of emotional learning and memory , such as Pavlovian fear conditioning in rats .

10542437|More specifically , antagonists of the NMDA receptor block both amygdaloid LTP induction and fear conditioning , fear conditioning induces increases in amygdaloid synaptic transmission that resemble LTP , and genetic modifications that disrupt amygdaloid LTP eliminate fear conditioning .

10515973|Mounting evidence implicates the central -LRB- CE -RRB- nucleus of the amygdala in the mediation of classically conditioned fear responses .

10509837|The data demonstrate : firstly , that processing of vocal emotion involves a bilaterally distributed network of brain regions ; and secondly , that processing of fear-related auditory stimuli involves context-specific interactions between the amygdala and other cortical and brainstem regions implicated in fear processing .

10509835|Bilateral damage to the amygdala in humans has been previously linked to two deficits in recognizing emotion in facial expressions : recognition of individual basic emotions , especially fear , and recognition of similarity among emotional expressions .

10509833|Findings from several case studies have shown that bilateral amygdala damage impairs recognition of emotions in facial expressions , especially fear .

10493770|Neurotoxic basolateral amygdala lesions impair learning and memory but not the performance of conditional fear in rats . .

10493770|We examined the influence of extensive overtraining -LRB- 75 trials -RRB- on the impact of neurotoxic basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- lesions on Pavlovian fear conditioning in rats .

10493770|These results suggest that neural circuitry outside of the amygdala can mediate contextual fear conditioning under some conditions .

10486901|The hyperactivation of the amygdala resulted in a long-lasting -LRB- at least for 3 weeks -RRB- increase in the locomotor activity against the background and deficit in exploratory behavior and rise of the level of anxiety and fear .

10481834|The amygdala is known to play a central role in mechanisms of fear and anxiety .

10481834|These data suggest that activation of galanin receptors in amygdala modulates neurotransmission involved in fear and experimental anxiety .

10468630|Studies in animals demonstrate a crucial role for the amygdala in emotional and social behavior , especially as related to fear and aggression .

10441229|Projections to the amygdala from the auditory thalamus have been implicated in the associative conditioning of fear responses to acoustic stimuli .

10415694|A functional role for dopamine transmission in the amygdala during conditioned fear . .

10415655|The extended amygdala : are the central nucleus of the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis differentially involved in fear versus anxiety ? .

10415655|Because this information may be less specific and of long duration , activation of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis may mediate anxiety , whereas activation of the central nucleus of the amygdala may mediate stimulus-specific fear .

10414989|Basolateral amygdala is involved in modulating consolidation of memory for classical fear conditioning . .

10400987|Here we describe that mSim2 mRNA is expressed in hippocampus and amygdala of adult mice , and that while mice overexpressing mSim2 under the control of the beta-actin promoter are viable and fertile and have superficially normal skeletal , brain and heart structures , they exhibit a moderate defect in context-dependent fear conditioning and a mild defect in the Morris water maze test .

10399930|Why we think plasticity underlying Pavlovian fear conditioning occurs in the basolateral amygdala . .

10357452|Acquisition of fear conditioning in rats requires the synthesis of mRNA in the amygdala . .

10357452|In this study , the role of mRNA synthesis in the amygdala was studied during the acquisition of conditional fear .

10342401|The context discrimination data revealed an amygdala-like , reduced fear effect of MPP lesions and an enhanced discriminative fear conditioning to context effect of LPP lesions .

10341269|GABAergic antagonists block the inhibitory effects of serotonin in the lateral amygdala : a mechanism for modulation of sensory inputs related to fear conditioning . .

10320690|The amygdala has long been implicated in conditioned fear .

10320690|Brain Research 590 -LRB- 1992 -RRB- 39-47 -RSB- suggesting that dopamine release in the amygdala may contribute to the acquisition and/or expression of conditioned fear .

10320690|In conclusion , these results suggest that dopamine transmission within the amygdala contributes to the acquisition and expression of Pavlovian fear conditioning .

10319564|Stresses such as immobilization or electric foot shock , wherein the physical factors rather than emotional ones were greatly involved , caused more marked increases in NA release in the more extended brain regions , as compared to psychological stress and conditioned fear , which caused increases in NA release preferentially in the hypothalamus , amygdala and locus coeruleus -LRB- LC -RRB- region .

10224295|The clearest changes were observed in brain regions known to be involved in conditioned fear responding , such as the amygdala complex and hippocampal formation and several cortical regions .

10224295|This consistency in regions known to be involved in conditioned fear responding -LRB- i.e. , amygdala complex and hippocampal formation -RRB- lead us to suggest that it is these changes , rather than the more variable cortical necrotic lesion , that is responsible for the behavioural deficits we observe following mild TBI .

10080962|The amygdala , cingulate , and septal nuclei develop at different rates which correlate with the emergence of wariness , fear , selective attachments , play behavior , and the oral and phallic stages of development .

10064799|The amygdala appears to play an important role in many of the responses to fear and anxiety .

10036290|Because N-methyl-D-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- - dependent mechanisms have been implicated in fear learning , we investigated the contribution of NMDA receptors to synaptic transmission at putative cortical and thalamic inputs using visualized whole cell recording in amygdala brain slices .

9926822|The authors compared two rat strains , selectively bred for their susceptibility to amygdala kindling , with respect to their performance on various behavioral and learning tasks that are associated with fear and anxiety .

9926822|Further , these observations imply that the relatively constrained excitability of the amygdala network in the SLOW rats might mediate their relatively greater expression of fear and anxiety compared with the FAST rats .

9893154|In addition , recent data reveal important bidirectional interactions between stress-system hormonal factors in depression and neural substrates implicated in many discrete behavioral alterations in depression -LRB- e.g. , the medial prefrontal cortex , important in shifting affect based on internal and external cues , the mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system , and the amygdala fear system -RRB- .

9882535|For psychological stressors such as conditioned fear , the neural circuits mediating neuroendocrine responses involve cortical activation of the basolateral amygdala , which in turn activates the central nucleus of the amygdala .

9880603|The amygdala is essential for classical fear conditioning .

9880603|According to the current model of auditory fear conditioning , the lateral nucleus is the input station of the amygdala for conditioned auditory stimuli , whereas the central nucleus is the output station for conditioned fear responses .

9870970|It is well established that the basolateral amygdala is critically involved in the association between an unconditioned stimulus -LRB- US -RRB- , such as a foot shock , and a conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- , such as a light , during classic fear conditioning .

9870970|Given that previous studies have shown that lesions of PoT/PIL alone had no effect on acquisition of conditioned fear , these results suggest that two parallel cortical -LRB- insula-amygdala -RRB- and subcortical -LRB- PoT/PIL-amygdala -RRB- pathways are involved in relaying shock information to the basolateral amygdala during fear conditioning .

9861467|Are different parts of the extended amygdala involved in fear versus anxiety ? .

9861467|Studies in rats , also using the startle reflex , indicate that highly processed explicit cue information -LRB- lights , tones , touch -RRB- activates the central nucleus of the amygdala , which in turn activates hypothalamic and brain stem target areas involved in specific signs of fear .

9861467|Somewhat less explicit information , such as that produced by exposure to a threating environment for several minutes or by intraventricular administration of the peptide corticotropin-releasing hormone may activate a brain area closely related to the amygdala , called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis , which in turn activates hypothalamic and brain stem target areas involved in specific signs of fear or anxiety .

9861466|Much of this enthusiasm has been triggered by studies of the amygdala and its contribution to fear .

9858368|Intact recognition of vocal expressions of fear following bilateral lesions of the human amygdala . .

9858368|A recent case study found that bilateral damage to the amygdala impairs the normal appraisal of vocal expressions of fear .

9858368|In this study we provide evidence of preserved evaluation of vocal expressions of fear in a female patient -LRB- S.P. -RRB- with bilateral damage to the amygdala but with intact basal ganglia .

9844005|Basolateral amygdala is not critical for cognitive memory of contextual fear conditioning . .

9844005|Evidence that lesions of the basolateral amygdala complex -LRB- BLC -RRB- impair memory for fear conditioning in rats , measured by lack of '' freezing '' behavior in the presence of cues previously paired with footshocks , has suggested that the BLC may be a critical locus for the memory of fear conditioning .

9829787|Both pre - and posttraining excitotoxic lesions of the basolateral amygdala abolish the expression of olfactory and contextual fear conditioning . .

9829787|The present study examined whether the basolateral amygdaloid complex -LRB- BLA -RRB- participates in the expression of fear conditioned to both an olfactory conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- and the training context .

9821359|People with Huntington 's disease and people suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder show severe deficits in recognizing facial expressions of disgust , whereas people with lesions restricted to the amygdala are especially impaired in recognizing facial expressions of fear .

9821068|For example , damage to the amygdala may be associated with an impaired ability to recognized emotional faces and a reduction of affect , especially anger , rage , and fear .

9821068|Seizures frequently emanate from the limbic system , and seizures that start in the amygdala can induce fear and perhaps even rage .

9802236|Neuropsychological studies report more impaired responses to facial expressions of fear than disgust in people with amygdala lesions , and vice versa in people with Huntington 's disease .

9802236|Our findings therefore -LRB- i -RRB- support the differential localization of the neural substrates of fear and disgust ; -LRB- ii -RRB- confirm the involvement of the amygdala in the emotion of fear , whether evoked by facial or vocal expressions ; -LRB- iii -RRB- confirm the involvement of the anterior insula and the striatum in reactions to facial expressions of disgust ; and -LRB- iv -RRB- suggest a possible general role for the perception of emotional expressions for the superior temporal gyrus .

9801965|The present article presents an integrative theory that explains how and why cognitive misinterpretations and '' false threat alarms '' leading to irrational fear and anxiety can arise from a neurobiological dysfunction in the amygdala and ascending transmitter systems .

9801383|The amygdala contributes to antinociception elicited by both psychological factors -LRB- e.g. , fear -RRB- and exogenous opioid agonists .

9763487|NMDA receptors in the amygdala seem to be critical for fear conditioning in naive rats .

9763487|Therefore , the present study examined whether blocking of NMDA receptors in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- prevents new fear learning in previously fear-conditioned rats , as measured by freezing behavior .

9749708|Footshock stress but not contextual fear conditioning induces long-term enhancement of auditory-evoked potentials in the basolateral amygdala of the freely behaving rat . .

9749708|We conclude that footshock stress produces general long-lasting changes in amygdala auditory field potentials that are not significantly affected by contextual fear conditioning .

9733191|Neuronal plasticity induced by fear conditioning is expressed during paradoxical sleep : evidence from simultaneous recordings in the lateral amygdala and the medial geniculate in rats . .

9733191|The lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- and its afferent connections from the medial geniculate -LRB- MG -RRB- play a pivotal role in auditory fear conditioning .

9716132|The cellular correlate of fear conditioning is thought to be associative N-methyl-D-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity within the amygdala .

9716132|This plasticity might underlie the increased synchronization of activity between neurons in the basolateral amygdala after fear conditioning .

9697861|Whereas much is now known about the behavioral importance of the lateral nucleus of the amygdala for the storage of implicit memories of fear , little is known in molecular terms about the signal transduction pathways required for long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- in this nucleus .

9697861|Using brain slices containing the amygdala , we have studied LTP in the pathway from external capsule to the lateral nucleus , a pathway that mediates information from the auditory cortex important for fear conditioning .

9689463|Immediate-early gene expression in the amygdala following footshock stress and contextual fear conditioning . .

9689463|This study investigated the increase in expression in the amygdala of 2 immediate-early genes , c-fos and NGFI-A , following contextual fear conditioning .

9689463|This suggests that NGFI-A mRNA in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala may play a role in contextual fear conditioning .

9682277|These data indicate that the BST , despite its anatomical continuity with the amygdala , is not critically involved in the acquisition of conditioned fear to an explicit CS .

9624002|Studies in animals have implicated the amygdala in emotional and social behaviours , especially those related to fear and aggression .

9622611|Infusion of the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 into the amygdala blocks fear expression in a potentiated startle paradigm . .

9622611|The observed opposing effects of amygdaloid DA D1 receptor antagonism on fear expression , along with earlier research demonstrating the involvement of ventral tegmental area -LRB- VTA -RRB- DA neurons on fear-potentiated startle , suggest a role for mesoamygdaloid activity in conditioned excitatory fear reactions .

9620698|Human amygdala activation during conditioned fear acquisition and extinction : a mixed-trial fMRI study . .

9620698|Echoplanar functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- was used in normal human subjects to investigate the role of the amygdala in conditioned fear acquisition and extinction .

9620698|Activation of the amygdala/periamygdaloid cortex was observed during conditioned fear acquisition and extinction .

9588484|This is puzzling , because 2 closely related areas , the septum and the amygdala , have been repeatedly implicated in fear behaviors .

9577241|Fear is a central motive state of action tendencies subserved by fear circuits , with the amygdala playing a central role .

9577241|Pathological anxiety is conceptualized as an exaggerated fear state in which hyperexcitability of fear circuits that include the amygdala and extended amygdala -LRB- i.e. , bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -RRB- is expressed as hypervigilance and increased behavioral responsivity to fearful stimuli .

9575479|Dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- and 3,4-dihydroxy-phenyl acetic acid -LRB- DOPAC -RRB- contents were elevated significantly by electric shock stress , psychological stress and conditioned fear stress in thalamus , hypothalamus and amygdala .

9518543|The results demonstrated that simultaneous Fos production in the hippocampus , central and medial nuclei of amygdala and somatosensory parietal cortex closely paralleled the ability of mice to acquire conditioned fear .

9549309|Together with the finding that increases , in noradrenaline release are closely related to the provocation of anxiety and/or fear , ethanol , in part , reduced tension , as mentioned in the tension reduction hypothesis , by attenuating stress-induced increases in noradrenaline release in the amygdala and locus coeruleus .

9526025|Overtraining does not mitigate contextual fear conditioning deficits produced by neurotoxic lesions of the basolateral amygdala . .

9502818|Differential effects of amygdala lesions on early and late plastic components of auditory cortex spike trains during fear conditioning . .

9502818|In auditory fear conditioning , pairing of a neutral acoustic conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- with an aversive unconditioned stimulus -LRB- US -RRB- results in an enhancement of neural responses to the CS in the amygdala and auditory cortex .

9533388|Face processing impairments after encephalitis : amygdala damage and recognition of fear . .

9533388|The findings showed impaired recognition of fear following bilateral temporal lobe damage when this included the amygdala .

9533388|Their results contrast with those of RS , with relative sparing of the amygdala region and unimpaired recognition of emotion , pointing clearly toward the importance of the amygdala in the recognition of fear .

9517826|A benzodiazepine -LRB- midazolam -RRB- , injected either systemically or directly into the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , differentially affected the acquisition of fear responses to a shocked context : Administration of the drug before conditioning impaired subsequent freezing to the context but spared analgesic responses in rats tested there for sensitivity to formalin pain .

9462473|The amygdala and individual differences in human fear conditioning . .

9462473|While animal research on fear conditioning suggests crucial involvement of the amygdala , this has not been corroborated in humans when using subtractive neuroimaging methodology .

9462473|Hence , we performed a directed search for amygdalar participation in human fear conditioning by correlating central and autonomic nervous activity .

9462473|A significant positive correlation was obtained between conditioned EDA and conditioned rCBF in the right amygdala -LRB- r = 0.75 , p < 0.05 -RRB- , supporting involvement of the amygdala in human fear conditioning .

9383520|A unilateral microinjection of morphine into the amygdala impaired fear conditioning to both a conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- paired with shock and the context where shock occurred , whereas a microinjection of morphine into the nucleus accumbens -LRB- NA -RRB- spared fear conditioning to the CS but impaired , in a dose-dependent and receptor-specific manner , fear conditioning to the context .

9412524|Differential modulation of changes in hippocampal-septal synaptic excitability by the amygdala as a function of either elemental or contextual fear conditioning in mice . .

9412524|Recent data obtained using a classic fear conditioning paradigm showed a dissociation between the retention of associations relative to contextual information -LRB- dependent on the hippocampal formation -RRB- and the retention of elemental associations -LRB- dependent on the amygdala -RRB- .

9412524|Our aim was to determine whether these two systems -LRB- '' behavioral expression '' system and '' factual memory '' system -RRB- interact by examining the consequences of amygdalar lesions -LRB- 1 -RRB- on the modifications of hippocampal-septal excitability and -LRB- 2 -RRB- on the behavioral expression of fear -LRB- freezing -RRB- resulting from an aversive conditioning during reexposure to conditional stimuli -LRB- CSs -RRB- .

9438795|Previous studies examining the neural substrates of fear conditioning have indicated unequivocally that the acquisition and expression of conditioned fear depends critically on the integrity of the amygdala .

9415924|The amygdala 's lateral nucleus receives and integrates the sensory inputs from the thalamic and cortical areas , and the central nucleus provides the interface with motor systems controlling specific fear responses in various modalities -LRB- behavioural , autonomic , endocrine -RRB- .

9415919|A large amount of data from many different laboratories indicate that the amygdala plays a crucial role in conditioned fear .

9415919|The amygdala receives information from all sensory modalities and projects to a variety of hypothalamic and brainstem target areas known to be critically involved in specific signs that are used to define fear and anxiety .

9415919|Electrical stimulation of the amygdala elicits a pattern of behaviours that mimic natural or conditioned states of fear .

9415919|Lesions of the amygdala block innate or conditioned fear and local infusion of drugs into the amygdala have anxiolytic effects in several behavioural tests .

9415919|Excitatory amino acid receptors in the amygdala are critical for the acquisition , expression and extinction of conditioned fear .

9415904|To reconcile this evidence , it has been suggested that 5-HT may enhance conditioned fear in the amygdala while inhibiting innate fear in the DPAG .

9415899|Extensive evidence indicates that the amygdala plays a key role in the potentiation of startle by moderate fear .

9364083|Double dissociation between the involvement of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the central nucleus of the amygdala in startle increases produced by conditioned versus unconditioned fear . .

9364080|The roles of the dorsal hippocampus and the central nucleus of the amygdala in the expression of contextual fear were assessed using two measures of conditioned fear : freezing and fear-potentiated startle .

9403689|The amygdala plays a critical role in the mediation of emotional responses , particularly fear , in both humans and animals .

9403689|Synaptic transmission in the medial geniculate nucleus -LRB- MGN -RRB- to lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- pathway , a key segment of the auditory fear conditioning circuit , is mediated largely through N-methyl-D-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- and non-NMDA -LRB- such as alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid -LRB- AMPA -RRB- -RRB- glutamate receptors ; the potential for neural plasticity in this pathway is suggested by its capacity to support long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- .

9403688|Here we explore the relation between LTP and memory in fear conditioning , an amygdala-dependent form of learning in which an innocuous conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- elicits fear responses after being associatively paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus -LRB- US -RRB- .

9394231|We suggest the rCBF correlative pattern during phobic fear to reflect fear-related activation of distinct neuronal pathways that involves the amygdala , the thalamus , and the striatum .

9354800|The fear component is regulated by amygdaloid pathways , while the contextual component is , at least in part , dependent on the hippocampus .

9339304|We recently reported that patients who had received unilateral temporal lobectomy , including the amygdala and hippocampus , show impaired acquisition in a fear conditioning task -LRB- LaBar , LeDoux , Spencer , & Phelps , 1995 -RRB- , indicating a deficit in emotional memory .

9333238|Results for fear generally confirmed previous positron emission tomography findings of amygdala involvement .

9331352|Single neurons were recorded in freely behaving rats during fear conditioning from areas of auditory cortex that project to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- .

9331352|Thus , rapid conditioning of fear responses to potentially dangerous stimuli depends on plasticity in the amygdala , while cortical areas may be particularly involved in higher cognitive -LRB- mnemonic and attentional -RRB- processing of fear experiences .

21223916|Is it time to invoke multiple fear learning systems in the amygdala ? .

9236251|However , the same amygdala-lesioned animals showed a complete blockade of fear-potentiated startle , a conditioned fear response sensitive to manipulations of the amygdala .

9267646|Functional inactivation of the lateral and basal nuclei of the amygdala by muscimol infusion prevents fear conditioning to an explicit conditioned stimulus and to contextual stimuli . .

9267646|The GABAa agonist , muscimol -LRB- 0.5 microgram in 0.5 microliter saline -RRB- , or vehicle was infused into the lateral and basal amygdala nuclei prior to fear conditioning or testing in rats .

9267646|Thus , activity in the lateral and basal amygdala appears to play an essential role in the acquisition and expression of fear conditioning .

9242405|Second-order fear conditioning prevented by blocking NMDA receptors in amygdala . .

9242405|For instance , fear conditioning would be blocked by microinfusion of the NMDA-receptor antagonist AP5 -LRB- D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate -RRB- into the basolateral amygdala if AP5 inhibited routine synaptic transmission , thereby reducing the ability of stimuli to activate amygdala neurons .

9242405|Expression of conditioned fear is amygdala-dependent and so provides a behavioural assessment of the ability of the reinforcer to activate amygdala neurons in the presence of AP5 .

9296566|Projections from the lateral part of the central amygdalar nucleus to the postulated fear conditioning circuit . .

9237754|The amygdala has long been thought to be involved in emotional behaviour , and its role in anxiety and conditioned fear has been highlighted .

9237754|This double dissociation demonstrates that distinct neural systems involving separate amygdaloid nuclei mediate different types of conditioned fear behaviour .

9205043|These results indicate that oxytocin - and vasopressin-binding sites represent an important feature of the extended amygdala and may participate in the large variety of functions that characterize this area , including reproductive and ingestive behaviors , conditioned fear and autonomic regulation .

9276841|Neurobiology of fear responses : the role of the amygdala . .

9276841|Evidence from many different laboratories using a variety of experimental techniques and animal species indicates that the amygdala plays a crucial role in conditioned fear and anxiety , as well as attention .

9276841|Many amygdaloid projection areas are critically involved in specific signs used to measure fear and anxiety .

9276841|Electrical stimulation of the amygdala elicits a pattern of behaviors that mimic natural or conditioned fear .

9276841|Lesions of the amygdala block innate or conditioned fear , as well as various measures of attention , and local infusions of drugs into the amygdala have anxiolytic effects in several behavioral tests .

9276841|N-methyl-D-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- receptors in the amygdala may be important in the acquisition of conditioned fear , whereas non-NMDA receptors are important for the expression of conditioned fear .

9276841|The peptide corticotropin-releasing hormone appears to be especially important in fear or anxiety and may act within the amygdala to orchestrate parts of the fear reaction .

9185561|Learning to fear dangerous situations requires the participation of neurons of the amygdala .

9185561|It is hypothesized that amygdalar training-induced neuronal plasticity in the initial trials of conditioning represents a substrate of learned fear , essential for the early and late cingulothalamic plasticity that is involved in mediation of acquisition of the instrumental avoidance response .

9238214|Roles of the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis in fear and anxiety measured with the acoustic startle reflex .

9189280|These dissociations suggest that limbic structures such as the septum , amygdala , and hippocampus exert parallel but distinct control over different fear reactions .

9087823|The conditioning of fear responses to a simple acoustic stimulus -LRB- pure tone -RRB- paired with footshock can be mediated by the transmission of auditory information to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala from either the auditory thalamus or the auditory cortex .

9030642|Potentiation of startle by conditioned and unconditioned fear stimuli appears to be mediated by the amygdala .

9037502|It was suggested that DA VTA neurons regulate the excitatory aspects of fear expression by gating levels of aversive emotional arousal within the amygdala-based fear system .

9000073|Impaired auditory recognition of fear and anger following bilateral amygdala lesions . .

9000073|Among the basic emotions , the processing of fear and anger has been shown to be disrupted by amygdala damage .

9000073|Although it remains puzzling why this not found in all cases , the importance of the amygdala in negative emotion , and especially fear , has been confirmed by conditioning , memory and positron emission tomography -LRB- PET -RRB- experiments .

9000073|This shows that the amygdala 's role in the recognition of certain emotions is not confined to vision , which is consistent with its being involved in the appraisal of danger and the emotion of fear .

9434086|In regard of recent data suggesting that the amygdala is playing a role in the recognition of fear in the auditory as well as in the visual modality this could suggest that the hippocampus may be part of the auditory pathway of fear recognition .

9027573|In many different animals , stimulation of the amygdala with an implanted electrode triggers a complex pattern of behavior and autonomic responses that resemble fear in humans .

8976532|Effects of small amygdala lesions on fear , but not aggression , in the rat . .

8971760|Additional studies with a modified experimental design indicated that fear conditioning mechanisms in association with the severity of the aversive stimuli , and not the learning of the avoidance response , may account for the changes in muscarinic acetylcholine receptor immunoreactivity in the amygdala .

8971760|The long-lasting , but reversible nature of these changes indicates that fear conditioning is accompanied by a dynamic plasticity of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor immunoreactivity in the amygdaloid complex .

8939850|When the transgene was expressed at high levels in the lateral amygdala and the striatum but not other forebrain structures , there was a deficit in fear conditioning , an implicit memory task , that also was reversible .

8996821|On the other hand , many amygdaloid output nuclei -LRB- magnocellular and intermediate division of the basal nucleus , the central nucleus -RRB- remained relatively undamaged , providing pathways for seizures spread and generation of seizure-related behavioural manifestations such as motor convulsions and fear response .

8986338|N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in the basolateral amygdala are required for both acquisition and expression of conditional fear in rats . .

8986338|In Experiment 1 , APV infusion into the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , before training , disrupted the acquisition of contextual fear .

8986337|It was suggested that VTA neurons and their forebrain DA projections regulate levels of aversive emotional arousal within the amygdala-based fear system .

8893004|Animal studies implicate the amygdala in both fear conditioning and face perception .

8893004|In humans , lesions of the amygdala can lead to selective deficits in the recognition of fearful facial expressions and impaired fear conditioning , and direct electrical stimulation evokes fearful emotional responses .

8893004|Here we report direct in vivo evidence of a differential neural response in the human amygdala to facial expressions of fear and happiness .

8930372|For the basic conditioning group , pre-exposure to the tone decreased the density of labelled cells in the auditory system , areas involved in fear and stress and a number of limbic areas , namely the amygdala , the Ammon 's horn of the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex .

8919001|Partial disruption of fear conditioning in rats with unilateral amygdala damage : correspondence with unilateral temporal lobectomy in humans . .

8919001|Conditioned fear in rats was assessed for the effects of pretraining amygdala lesions -LRB- unilateral vs. bilateral -RRB- across unconditioned stimulus -LRB- US -RRB- modalities -LRB- white noise vs. shock -RRB- .

8919001|It was concluded that white noise can serve as an effective US and that unilateral amygdala lesions attenuate but do not eliminate conditioned fear in rats .

8891302|Since the ASR amplitude is a sensitive measure for anxiety or fear , these findings suggest that amygdala kindling does not induce a state of anxiety or fear .

10456093|Convergent but temporally separated inputs to lateral amygdala neurons from the auditory thalamus and auditory cortex use different postsynaptic receptors : in vivo intracellular and extracellular recordings in fear conditioning pathways . .

10456093|The lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- , a key component of the fear conditioning circuitry , receives a rapid but relatively impoverished auditory input from the auditory thalamus and a slower but richer input from the auditory cortex .

9118351|It is argued that the amygdala plays a crucial role in the encoding and retrieval of fear memories activated by specific stimuli that have been associated with aversive events .

8756453|For example , lesions of either basolateral amygdala -LRB- ABL -RRB- or the central nucleus -LRB- CN -RRB- interfere with the acquisition or expression of conditioned fear .

8892333|Numerous studies in both rats and humans indicate the importance of the amygdala in the acquisition and expression of learned fear .

8892333|The identification of the amygdala as an essential neural substrate for fear conditioning has permitted neurophysiological examinations of synaptic processes in the amygdala that may mediate fear conditioning .

8864263|Retrograde abolition of conditional fear after excitotoxic lesions in the basolateral amygdala of rats : absence of a temporal gradient . .

8864263|The role of the basolateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- in the acquisition and expression of Pavlovian fear conditioning was examined in 80 rats .

8728550|To reconcile this evidence , Deakin and Graeff have suggested that the ascending 5-HT pathway that originates in the dorsal raphe nucleus -LRB- DRN -RRB- and innervates the amygdala and frontal cortex facilitates conditioned fear , while the DRN-periventricular pathway innervating the periventricular and periaqueductal gray matter inhibits inborn fight/flight reactions to impending danger , pain , or asphyxia .

8731050|The results support the contention -LRB- B. J. Young & R.N. Leaton , 1994 -RRB- that heart rate changes can reflect fear conditioned during acoustic startle testing and , in addition , suggest that the amygdala mediates responses to nonsignal acoustic stimuli .

8819647|Ibotenic acid-induced lesions in the central amygdaloid nucleus inhibit conditioned fear stress-induced increases in plasma renin concentrations , but do not reduce the renin response to immobilization .

8789938|The amygdala and fear conditioning : has the nut been cracked ? .

8978989|A pivotal role for the amygdala in the transmission and interpretation of fear and anxiety is suggested by extensive afferents to the amygdala from thalamic and cortical exteroceptive systems , as well as by subcortical visceral afferent pathways .

8978989|The efferent pathways involving the amygdala , locus coeruleus , hypothalamus , periaqueductal gray , and striatum mediate autonomic , neuroendocrine , and skeletal-motor responses associated with fear and anxiety .

8963688|These results are discussed in terms of benzodiazepines acting within the amygdala to produce a retrieval deficit whereby fear conditioning that takes place under the influence of a benzodiazepine can only be accessed if the animal is tested in the presence of ongoing noxious stimulation .

8851921|A series of studies have shown , that the amygdaloid complex is necessary for the acquisition and the expression of conditioned fear .

8851921|Yet it was unclear , wh ether this amygdaloreticular pathway directly transfers the effects of conditioned fear from the amygdala to the primary startle circuit or whether there exist one or more relay nuclei within this pathway or even additional parallel circuits .

8803851|In contrast , events that are themselves innocuous but which signal threat -LRB- either learned or innate danger signals -RRB- activate fear and defensive systems in the amygdala and PAG which engage the descending antinociceptive projections in the RVM .

8724425|In this work we examined the influence of lesions of brain structures involved in the expression of fear , such as periaqueductal gray matter , amygdala , and substantia nigra pars reticulata -LRB- SNpr -RRB- , on these aversive responses .

8540778|Subjects with intense procaine-induced fear compared with those with euphoria had greater increases in left amygdalar CBF .

8540778|Absolute and normalized left amygdalar CBF changes tended to correlate positively with fear and negatively with euphoria intensity .

8788858|HPLC analysis showed a significant increase in the noradrenergic system activity in the emotional brain areas -LRB- hypothalamus , midbrain , amygdala -RRB- and frontal cortex at the time of the fear drive .

8552250|The amygdaloid complex plays an essential role in auditory fear conditioning of the Pavlovian type .

8552250|The available evidence suggests that the lateral nucleus is the input station of the amygdala for auditory conditioned stimuli , whereas the central medial nucleus is the output for conditioned fear responses .

7576647|The lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is the first site in the amygdala where the plasticity underlying fear conditioning could occur .

7472506|Several studies suggest that axonal projections from the hippocampal formation -LRB- HF -RRB- to the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- play a role in Pavlovian fear conditioning to contextual conditional stimuli .

7666173|We have previously reported that bilateral amygdala damage in humans compromises the recognition of fear in facial expressions while leaving intact recognition of face identity -LRB- Adolphs et al. , 1994 -RRB- .

7666173|We also obtained further data on our subject with bilateral amygdala damage , in order to elucidate possible mechanisms that could account for the impaired recognition of expressions of fear .

7666173|Based on our data , and on what is known about the amygdala 's connectivity , we propose that the amygdala is required to link visual representations of facial expressions , on the one hand , with representations that constitute the concept of fear , on the other .

8528703|The midbrain periaqueductal gray -LRB- PAG -RRB- and the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CNA -RRB- are both known to be involved in fear and anxiety , analgesia , vocalization , cardiovascular and respiratory changes , and freezing .

8545545|It interacts with the amygdala and its lesion alters fear and anxiety produced by stimulation of amygdala .

7576207|Effects of a microinjection of morphine into the amygdala on the acquisition and expression of conditioned fear and hypoalgesia in rats . .

7576207|A unilateral microinjection of morphine into the amygdala impaired the acquisition of fear and hypoalgesic responses in rats exposed to a heated floor in a hot-plate apparatus .

7576207|A microinjection of morphine into the amygdala reduced the expression of fear responses and of naloxone-sensitive hypoalgesic responses , but did not reduce the expression of naloxone-insensitive hypoalgesic responses .

7619517|Transmission of auditory information from the medial geniculate body to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala is believed to be involved in the conditioning of fear responses to acoustic stimuli .

7662148|Lesions of the central nucleus of the amygdala block conditioned excitation , but not conditioned inhibition of fear as measured with the fear-potentiated startle effect . .

7662148|The present experiment assessed whether lesions of the amygdala would also block the expression of conditioned inhibition of fear .

7619319|Effects of benzodiazepine microinjection into the amygdala or periaqueductal gray on the expression of conditioned fear and hypoalgesia in rats . .

7619319|The results are discussed in terms of gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic inhibition of antinociceptive mechanisms in the vlPAG and of the activation of these mechanisms by amygdala-based fear processes .

7619315|Conditioning of fear reactions to an auditory conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- paired with a footshock unconditioned stimulus -LRB- US -RRB- involves CS transmission to the amygdala from the auditory thalamus , the auditory cortex , or both .

7891169|Involvement of subcortical and cortical afferents to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala in fear conditioning measured with fear-potentiated startle in rats trained concurrently with auditory and visual conditioned stimuli . .

7891169|The goal of this work was to test the involvement , in fear conditioning , of afferents to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala originating from the auditory thalamus , auditory cortex , and perirhinal area .

7891169|These results indicate that the auditory thalamus is specifically involved , through either its direct or indirect amygdaloid afferents , in fear conditioning to auditory CSs .

7891168|Involvement of the central nucleus and basolateral complex of the amygdala in fear conditioning measured with fear-potentiated startle in rats trained concurrently with auditory and visual conditioned stimuli . .

7891168|The goal of this work was to test the involvement of the central nucleus and basolateral complex of the amygdala in fear conditioning , using auditory and visual conditioned stimuli -LRB- CSs -RRB- .

7891168|Electrolytic or ibotenic acid lesions of the central nucleus of the amygdala blocked fear-potentiated startle to both auditory and visual CSs , consistent with the idea that the central nucleus serves as a response independent , final common relay for fear conditioning .

7891168|This finding is consistent with the suggestion that , in fear conditioning , the basolateral complex of the amygdala serves as an obligatory relay of sensory information from subcortical and cortical sensory areas to the central nucleus of the amygdala .

7780731|The amygdala in the brain plays a critical role in learning emotional components of experience , such as conditioned fear ; these processes in turn affect many other aspects of memory and cognition .

7663891|To examine the possibility that cholinergic antagonism mimics hippocampal damage or amygdala damage , rats were given scopolamine -LRB- 1 mg/kg -RRB- either before or after fear conditioning .

7663891|The present results suggest that scopolamine 's impact on fear conditioning is mediated by some mechanism other than impaired hippocampal or amygdala functioning .

7990957|Here , with the help of one such rare patient , we report findings that suggest the human amygdala may be indispensable to : -LRB- 1 -RRB- recognize fear in facial expressions ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- recognize multiple emotions in a single facial expression ; but -LRB- 3 -RRB- is not required to recognize personal identity from faces .

7990948|Faces , fear and the amygdala . .

24203551|Since this mode of defense is activated by learned fear , forebrain structures such as the amygdala play a critical role in its organization .

7895029|Because lesions of the central nucleus of the amygdala block the effects of both stress and fear in many experimental paradigms , the present study evaluated whether such lesions would block stress-induced increases in prefrontal dopamine turnover using either mild footshock or novelty as stressors .

7826507|Effects of muscimol applied to the basolateral amygdala on acquisition and expression of contextual fear conditioning in rats . .

7826507|The relative contribution of the amygdala to the learning vs. performance of conditional fear with the GABAa agonist muscimol was assessed .

7826507|Rats were prepared with cannulas aimed at the basolateral amygdala and trained in a contextual fear conditioning paradigm in which each subject received a series of footshocks in a distinctive observation chamber .

7621504|The amygdaloid complex is a key structure in mechanisms of fear and anxiety .

7621504|These findings provide evidence that neuronal activation and c-fos induction in the amygdala may be of importance for mechanisms of fear and anxiety .

7922461|Relationship between atrophy of the amygdala and ictal fear in temporal lobe epilepsy . .

7922461|Results support the finding that ictal fear is related to pathology of the amygdala and that it , like the hippocampus , is an important substrate of TLE .

7922536|Since the amygdala has been shown to play a critical role in fear , these findings suggest that the analgesia elicited by these challenges involves a substantial fear component .

7520203|Neurotransmission in the rat amygdala related to fear and anxiety . .

7520203|An impressive amount of evidence from many different laboratories using a variety of experimental techniques indicates that the amygdala plays a crucial role in the acquisition , consolidation and retention or expression of conditioned fear .

7911130|Research on the implication of the amygdala in classical fear conditioning suggests that the central amygdaloid nucleus is the output station of the amygdala for conditioned fear responses , while the lateral nucleus acts as the input nucleus , at least for auditory conditioned stimuli .

8025708|The avian archistriatum , part of which may be homologous with the mammalian amygdala , has been implicated in fear and avoidance behaviour .

8199868|Microinfusions of a benzodiazepine anxiolytic -LRB- midazolam -RRB- into the septum or the amygdala suppressed different fear reactions in two tests of rat '' anxiety '' .

8199868|These results suggest that benzodiazepine receptor systems within the amygdala and the septum differentially mediate specific fear reactions .

7910746|Acquisition of contextual Pavlovian fear conditioning is blocked by application of an NMDA receptor antagonist D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid to the basolateral amygdala . .

7910746|Rats , with chronic cannula placed bilaterally in the amygdala , received infusions of the N-methyl-D-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- receptor antagonist D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid -LRB- APV -RRB- before contextual Pavlovian fear conditioning .

7910746|It is concluded that an NMDA-mediated process near the basolateral region of the amygdala -LRB- e.g. , lateral or basolateral nucleus -RRB- is essential for the learning of fear .

7512773|Stimulation within the amygdala complex produces signs of fear without a relevant external object , while lesions in this region abolish normal fear responses .

8136044|These latter amygdaloid nuclei may actually be the site of plasticity for fear conditioning , because local infusion of the NMDA antagonist AP5 into these nuclei blocks the acquisition of fear-potentiated startle .

8136044|Local infusion of AP5 into the amygdala was found to block the acquisition of experimental extinction , a prototypical method for reducing fear .

8136063|Effects of amygdala , hippocampus , and periaqueductal gray lesions on short - and long-term contextual fear . .

8136063|The effects of amygdala , hippocampus , and periaqueductal gray -LRB- PAG -RRB- lesions on contextual fear conditioning in rats were examined .

8329134|Previous studies have shown that the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- AL -RRB- is essential in auditory fear conditioning and that neurons in the AL respond to auditory stimuli .

8402403|These findings were considered to be compatible with the hypothesis that the amygdala plays an important role in converting environmental stimuli into emotions such as rage or fear .

8484901|Lesions of the basolateral region and central nucleus of the amygdala eliminated the fear that transfers to the shuttle box after inescapable shock , as well as the fear conditioned in the shuttle box by the shuttle box shocks .

8257926|These latter amygdaloid nuclei may actually be the site of plasticity for fear conditioning , because local infusion of the NMDA antagonist AP5 blocks the acquisition but not the expression of fear-potentiated startle .

8257926|Local infusion of AP5 into the amygdala was found to block the acquisition of experimental extinction , a prototypical method for reducing fear .

8491264|As the amygdaloid complex has been implicated in emotional behaviour , particularly in the mediation of fear , these findings substantiate the concept that the amygdaloid complex plays a key role for the enhancement of the ASR by conditioned and unconditioned fear .

8095136|The involvement of non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in the amygdala in the expression of conditioned fear was examined using the fear-potentiated startle paradigm .

8095136|The drug dose-dependently blocked the expression of potentiated startle in both sensory modalities , indicating that activation of non-NMDA receptors in the amygdala is necessary for the expression of conditioned fear .

1422845|A role for particular amygdaloid DA projections in the formation of conditioned fear or anticipatory anxiety and its modulation by anxiolytics is also suggested .

1454221|These results demonstrate that the auditory cortex is not required for the conditioning of fear responses to simple acoustic stimuli and add to the growing body of evidence that fear conditioning can be mediated by subcortical -LRB- amygdaloid -RRB- projections of the acoustic thalamus .

1515934|These findings suggest a role for pertussis toxin sensitive G-proteins , perhaps within the amygdala , in the expression of conditioned but not unconditioned fear .

1641430|Contribution of the amygdala to learning and performance of conditional fear . .

1641430|The relative contribution of this structure to acquisition and performance during fear conditioning was assessed by making temporary lesions in the amygdala prior to training or retention testing in a single-trial Pavlovian conditioning preparation .

1641430|Microinjection of lidocaine HCl -LRB- 5.0 % , 1.0 microliters -RRB- into the amygdala prior to the presentation of a CS signalling footshock resulted in a significant attenuation of the performance of conditional fear , as indexed by the amount of time rats spent engaged in defensive freezing behavior during the retention session .

1616614|The medial division of the medial geniculate nucleus -LRB- MGm -RRB- and the posterior intralaminar nucleus -LRB- PIN -RRB- are necessary for fear conditioning to an auditory conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- , receive both auditory and somatosensory input , and project to the amygdala , which is involved in production of fear conditioned responses .

1607942|The involvement of the amygdala in icv CRF-enhanced startle is consistent with the hypothesis that both the amygdala and CRF are critically involved in fear and stress .

1352104|Together with earlier reports , these data suggest that an NMDA-dependent process localized in or near the amygdala may be necessary for the acquisition of conditioned fear across different sensory modalities .

1594684|These results suggest that amygdala kindling affects the normal fear reaction of rats , a response that is known to be mediated through the amygdaloid pathways .

1594678|Ibotenate lesions of rACE did produce a deficit in PA , consistent with views of a role of this part of the amygdala in fear .

1590953|Differential contribution of amygdala and hippocampus to cued and contextual fear conditioning . .

1590953|The contribution of the amygdala and hippocampus to the acquisition of conditioned fear responses to a cue -LRB- a tone paired with footshock -RRB- and to context -LRB- background stimuli continuously present in the apparatus in which tone-shock pairings occurred -RRB- was examined in rats .

1590953|Lesions of the amygdala interfered with the conditioning of fear responses to both the cue and the context , whereas lesions of the hippocampus interfered with conditioning to the context but not to the cue .

1590953|The amygdala is thus involved in the conditioning of fear responses to simple , modality-specific conditioned stimuli as well as to complex , polymodal stimuli , whereas the hippocampus is only involved in fear conditioning situations involving complex , polymodal events .

1590953|These findings suggest an associative role for the amygdala and a sensory relay role for the hippocampus in fear conditioning .

1347562|The results show that infusion of the NMDA antagonist D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid -LRB- AP5 -RRB- into the amygdala , a limbic structure known to be important for fear conditioning , dose-dependently blocked extinction of conditioned fear .

1347562|These results , together with a previous report from our laboratory -LRB- Miserendino et al. , 1990 -RRB- , demonstrate the importance of the amygdala in the elaboration of conditioned fear and suggest that an NMDA-dependent process might underlie the extinction of conditioned fear .

1741445|While the literature is somewhat inconsistent , most studies suggest a role for the septal nuclei in the inhibition of fear and stress responses -LRB- at the behavioral , autonomic and hormonal levels -RRB- while the central nucleus of the amygdala is involved in the production of such responses .

1741445|These results suggest that the increase in startle amplitude resulting from septal damage might be due to a disinhibition of neuronal activity in the central nucleus of the amygdala , a structure known to mediate the increase in startle associated with conditioned and unconditioned fear , or from antagonistic interactions at other target sites which themselves modulate startle .

1663757|Efferent pathway of the amygdala involved in conditioned fear as measured with the fear-potentiated startle paradigm . .

1663757|Fear-potentiated startle in the rat is a measure of conditioned fear that is blocked by lesions of the central nucleus of the amygdala .

1842702|Induction of the c-fos proto-oncogene in rat amygdala during unconditioned and conditioned fear . .

1842702|Induction of the nuclear proto-oncogene c-fos in rat amygdala was investigated 30-40 min following the presentation of mild footshocks -LRB- unconditioned fear -RRB- or of contextual cues associated with similar footshocks 24 h earlier -LRB- conditioned fear -RRB- .

1842702|Unconditioned and conditioned fear both elevated amygdala c-fos mRNA dramatically above control levels .

1763110|Freezing behavior was measured in Experiment 2 as an index of fear , and the amygdala injections of diazepam retarded the development of fear in the startle chamber .

1832750|Experiment 1 investigated the effects of catecholaminergic deafferentation or cell body lesions of the amygdala on fear conditioning to explicit and contextual cues .

1832750|These results suggest a double dissociation of the effects of amygdala and hippocampal damage on fear conditioning to explicit and contextual cues .

1706363|The central nucleus of the amygdala has been implicated in a variety of emotional/cognitive functions ranging from fear and orienting responses , defensive and aversive reactions , associative conditioning , cardiovascular regulation , and antinociception .

2255742|The similarity of amygdala-stimulated enhancement and fear potentiation of electrically elicited startle is also discussed .

1972778|We now show that NMDA antagonists infused into the amygdala block the acquisition , but not the expression , of fear conditioning measured with a behavioural assay mediated by a defined neural circuit -LRB- fear-potentiation of the acoustic startle reflex -RRB- .

1972778|The data indicate that an NMDA-dependent process in the amygdala subserves associative fear conditioning .

2329367|The lateral amygdaloid nucleus : sensory interface of the amygdala in fear conditioning . .

2203068|These changes are used to infer a central state of fear which involves the central nucleus of the amygdala and its efferent projections to the brainstem .

2544201|Activation of the amygdala by shock may be the unconditioned response relevant for fear conditioning .

2736396|The central nucleus of amygdala -LRB- Ce -RRB- participates in expression of autonomic responses associated with fear or stress-related behaviors .

2854842|Different projections of the central amygdaloid nucleus mediate autonomic and behavioral correlates of conditioned fear . .

2854842|Different efferent projections of the central amygdala thus appear to mediate the behavioral and autonomic concomitants of conditioned fear .

3393697|The central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- Ce -RRB- mediates cardiovascular and autonomic changes associated with defense or fear responses .

3575483|These data indicate that the effect of lesions of the amygdala on fear-potentiated startle is not specific to one sensory modality , consistent with the hypotheses that the amygdala is involved in processing multimodal information related to conditioned fear , or is part of an output pathway for motor and autonomic expressions of conditioned fear .

3767832|However , since the IBO lesions did not affect the most medial parts of the amygdala complex including the central amygdala nucleus , the role of this nucleus in fear arousal has to be investigated further .

3730149|Freezing behavior , a natural fear response , was not affected by the hypothalamic or the amygdaloid bicuculline infusions .

3954873|Lesions of the amygdala , but not of the cerebellum or red nucleus , block conditioned fear as measured with the potentiated startle paradigm . .

3954873|Taken together , the results are consistent with the hypothesis that the amygdala is involved in fear conditioning , because potentiated startle is a measure of conditioned fear .

3097683|The lack of reduced corticosterone levels in any of the lesioned groups do not indicate that general fear arousal is critically dependent on intact central amygdala neurons in the rat .

3001464|These findings suggest : -LRB- 1 -RRB- that diazepam acts via BDZ receptors to attenuate stress-induced increases in NA turnover selectively in the hypothalamus , amygdala , hippocampus , cerebral cortex and LC region and -LRB- 2 -RRB- that this decreased noradrenergic activity might be closely related to relief of distress-evoked hyperemotionality , i.e. , fear and/or anxiety in animals .
