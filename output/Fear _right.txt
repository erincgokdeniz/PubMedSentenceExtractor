24210457|In patients with lTLE , fear ratings were comparable to those of healthy subjects and were correlated with relatively stronger activations in the right compared to the left amygdala .

20939663|In contrast , exposure to negatively valenced events involving a reduction in expected food rewards after bar pressing or presentation of a footshock during fear conditioning produced significant increases in norepinephrine output sampled from only the right but not left basolateral amygdala .

18982530|Greater effective connectivity from right LOFC to amygdala differentiated emotion expressions conducive to perceiver approach -LRB- happy , neutral , and fear -RRB- from angry expressions that elicit perceiver withdrawal .

17970731|The effect of CB -LRB- 1 -RRB- receptor antagonism in the right basolateral amygdala on conditioned fear and associated analgesia in rats . .

17970731|The present study investigated the effects of administration of the cannabinoid -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- CB -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- receptor antagonist SR141716A into the right basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- on expression of conditioned fear , formalin-evoked nociceptive behaviour , fear-conditioned analgesia and associated alterations in monoamine levels in discrete rat brain areas .

12724169|We reviewed and reanalyzed data from our laboratory , indicating that subjective feelings of fear and distress are correlated with regional cerebral blood flow -LRB- rCBF -RRB- in the right but not the left amygdala during anxiety provocation in individuals with social anxiety disorder , specific phobias .

11241871|Despite the many studies highlighting the role of the amygdala in fear perception , few have examined differences between right and left amygdalar responses .
