10023948|The mean volume of the left amygdala-hippocampal complex -LRB- AHC -RRB- was lower in the first-episode group -LRB- 4.3 cm3 -LSB- 0.6 -RSB- -RRB- than in the high-risk group -LRB- 4.6 cm3 -LSB- 0.6 -RSB- -RRB- , and in turn than in the controls -LRB- 4.8 cm3 -LSB- 0.7 -RSB- -RRB- ; these differences were significant -LRB- p < 0.05 -RRB- both for absolute volumes and values adjusted for brain volume and other confounders .
10073475|Unilateral block of NMDA receptors in the amygdala prevents predator stress-induced lasting increases in anxiety-like behavior and unconditioned startle -- effective hemisphere depends on the behavior .
10073475|To localize the site of action of systemic MK-801 , MK-801 was injected in the amygdala 30 min prior to predator stress .
10073475|The target of the injection was the basolateral amygdala .
10073475|Injections of MK-801 in a variety of sites in the basolateral amygdala had no effect on the suppression of open-arm exploration produced by predator stress .
10073475|Other amygdala nuclei or other limbic sites likely mediate the effects of systemically administered MK-801 on this behavior .
10073475|In contrast , NMDA receptors in the left lateral amygdala mediate lasting suppression of risk assessment .
10073475|MK-801 , in a variety of sites in the left but not right lateral amygdala , blocked the effects of predator stress on risk assessment .
10073475|Different NMDA-dependent amygdala circuitry mediated effects of predator stress on unconditioned acoustic startle 1 week after cat exposure .
10073475|The data indicate that integrity of the left lateral amygdala is necessary for potentiation of startle amplitude by predator stress , though NMDA receptors are not involved in this function .
10073475|Nevertheless , NMDA receptors in the right , but not the left lateral amygdala , mediate initiation of changes in startle .
10073475|The data also suggest that the right amygdala action is `` downstream '' from the left amygdala contribution .
10073475|Finally , the findings of the importance of the right amygdala in stress-induced enhancement of the startle response provides neurobiological face validity to predator stress as a model of aspects of posttraumatic stress disorder .
10075898|The left amygdala , a structure involved in implicit learning of visual representations , was activated by the categorization task on unknown faces .
10103127|Glucocorticoid receptor activation in the rat nucleus of the solitary tract facilitates memory consolidation : involvement of the basolateral amygdala .
10103127|Additionally , pretraining infusions of the beta1-adrenergic antagonist atenolol -LRB- 0.5 microg in 0.2 microL -RRB- into the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , a brain structure which receives noradrenergic projections from the NTS and is implicated in memory storage modulation , blocked the memory-enhancing effects of the GR agonist -LRB- 1.0 ng -RRB- infused into the NTS .
10200226|During swallowing , group PET analysis identified increased regional cerebral blood flow -LRB- rCBF -RRB- -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- within bilateral caudolateral sensorimotor cortex -LSB- Brodmann 's area -LRB- BA -RRB- 3 , 4 , and 6 -RSB- , right anterior insula -LRB- BA 16 -RRB- , right orbitofrontal and temporopolar cortex -LRB- BA 11 and 38 -RRB- , left mesial premotor cortex -LRB- BA 6 and 24 -RRB- , left temporopolar cortex and amygdala -LRB- BA 38 and 34 -RRB- , left superiomedial cerebellum , and dorsal brain stem .
10213976|The SPM analysis demonstrated significant decrease of relative rCBF in the basal fore-brain area , the left hippocampus , the left amygdala , and the left parahippocampal area .
10214738|BACKGROUND : We previously found that VNS acutely induces rCBF alterations at sites that receive vagal afferents and higher-order projections , including dorsal medulla , somatosensory cortex -LRB- contralateral to stimulation -RRB- , thalamus and cerebellum bilaterally , and several limbic structures -LRB- including hippocampus and amygdala bilaterally -RRB- .
10219788|The human amygdala plays an important role in gaze monitoring .
10219788|Discrimination between the direction of gaze significantly activated a region in the left amygdala during eye-contact and no eye-contact tasks to the same extent .
10219788|However , a region in the right amygdala was specifically activated only during the eye-contact task .
10219788|Results confirm that the left amygdala plays a general role in the interpretation of eye gaze direction , and that the activity of the right amygdala of the subject increases when another individual 's gaze is directed towards him .
10219788|This suggests that the human amygdala plays a role in reading social signals from the face .
10224295|The clearest changes were observed in brain regions known to be involved in conditioned fear responding , such as the amygdala complex and hippocampal formation and several cortical regions .
10224295|This consistency in regions known to be involved in conditioned fear responding -LRB- i.e. , amygdala complex and hippocampal formation -RRB- lead us to suggest that it is these changes , rather than the more variable cortical necrotic lesion , that is responsible for the behavioural deficits we observe following mild TBI .
10224295|Importantly , our results demonstrate that like the hippocampus , the amygdala is a sub-cortical structure particularly sensitive to the effects of mild brain trauma and underline the fact that cerebral regions distant from the location of the fluid impact can be affected .
10330702|The recent evidence from literature testify to functional asymmetry of the structures belonging to the limbic system : hippocampus , amygdala , and hypothalamus .
10330702|Predominant activation of the right hippocampus and right amygdala during perception and memorizing of visual picturesque images and solving the tasks provoking emotional stress , apparently , concerns the functional specialization of the right hemisphere in general .
10355673|First , we tested whether the amygdala has a neural response to sad and/or angry facial expressions .
10355673|We found that increasing intensity of sad facial expression was associated with enhanced activity in the left amygdala and right temporal pole .
10355673|We found no support for the suggestion that angry expressions generate a signal in the amygdala .
10371536|The volumes of the EC , the hippocampus , and the amygdala were measured using a standardized MRI protocol .
10371536|The volumes of the hippocampus and the amygdala were smaller on the side of the focus in TLE patients compared with controls -LRB- p < 0.05 -RRB- .
10379417|Additional analyses for the subset of 5 patients with left and 6 patients with right temporal lobectomies involving removal of the hippocampus and amygdala were in the same direction as the analyses for all 18 participants .
10379417|The differences between performance on the affective and neutral stories for the left and right temporal lobe epilepsy patients are discussed and related to the role of the amygdala in affective processing .

10381776|Agonist stimulation of delta receptor guanylyl 5 ' - -LSB- gamma -LSB- 35S -RSB- thio -RSB- - triphosphate binding was lateralized in prefrontal cortex and amygdala , but not nucleus accumbens .
10381776|Lateralized binding in amygdala , high locomotor activity , and sensory sensitivity correlated positively with greater sensitivity to SNC-80-induced depression in these measures .
10381776|Higher binding in the right amygdala correlated with higher plasma corticosterone levels .

10405084|BACKGROUND : The hippocampus , amygdala and related functional circuits have been implicated in the regulation of emotional expression and memory processes , which are affected in major depression .
10405084|Using established anatomical guidelines for structure delineation , volumetric measurements of left and right hippocampus and anterior hippocampus/amygdala complex were completed under blinded conditions using a semi-automated computer mensuration system , with patients and controls in random order .
10406013|Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were stimulated at the right amygdala to induce SE .

10420552|Effects of novel or relevant -LRB- a single exposure to experimental chamber -RRB- and irrelevant -LRB- 20 exposures to experimental chamber -RRB- stimuli on the levels of serotonin -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid -LRB- 5-HIAA -RRB- in the left and right hippocamp and amygdala were studied in male and female rats .
10420552|It was found that hemispheric specificity of 5-HT metabolism in hippocampus and amygdala depended on sex and novelty of information .
10420552|In the amygdala , a hemispheric asymmetry of the 5-HT involvement , due to right-hemispheric changes in 5-HT metabolism , was observed only in male rats .
10420552|In females , an increase in 5-HT level was found in the left and right amygdalas in response to irrelevant stimulus .
10449110|METHODS : The authors performed volumetric measurements of hippocampus , amygdala , fornix , and mamillary bodies in 50 patients with MTLE and compared the results with normal controls and patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy .
10449110|RESULTS : Control -LRB- n = 17 -RRB- measurements of the amygdala , hippocampus , and fornix revealed larger volumes of the right hemisphere structures -LRB- p < 0.001 -RRB- .
10449260|Emphasis is placed on the quantification of the activity from two ROIs , fusiform gyrus -LRB- FG -RRB- and amygdala -LRB- AM -RRB- , which have been best studied in the context of processing of faces and facial expressions of emotion , respectively .
10449260|The amygdala activity was significantly different between 150 and 180 ms for fearful expression , and even earlier for happy expression .
10450847|Brain metabolites in the hippocampus-amygdala region and cerebellum in autism : an 1H-MR spectroscopy study .

10482383|MRI volume of the amygdala : a reliable method allowing separation from the hippocampal formation .
10482383|antonio.convit@mcadr.med.nyu.edu Studies of MRI-derived volume of the amygdala have been mostly performed on coronal sections where its boundaries with the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex are indistinct .
10482383|To date , all reports of in vivo amygdala volume have consistently overestimated the size of the structure .
10482383|We have developed a method for the MRI-based in vivo measurement of the amygdala volume which allows a better separation of the amygdala from the adjoining hippocampal formation .
10482383|On the original sagittal and the reformatted axial planes , where it is more readily apparent , we delineated the boundaries between the amygdala and the hippocampus and the amygdala and the hippocampo-amygdala transition area , respectively .
10482383|We then projected those markings onto the coronal plane , where the other boundaries of the amygdala are more easily seen .
10482383|Using these markings as a guide and utilizing extra-amygdalar coronal landmarks for the anterior end , we outlined the whole amygdala on the coronal plane and determined its volume .
10482383|We observed that 45 % of the coronal slices that contained amygdala also contained some hippocampus .
10482383|The amygdala measurement had high test-retest reliability , with an intra-class correlation coefficient -LRB- rICC -RRB- of 0.99 for the total volume and an rICC of 0.93 for the measurement at the level of the individual slice .
10482383|The average amygdala volume was 1.05 + / - 0.17 cm3 on the right and 1.14 + / - 0.15 cm3 on the left .
10482383|Our amygdala volumes are in agreement with those reported in postmortem studies , which provides the reported method with face validity .
10482807|on long term potentiation of amygdala efferents and behavior following kindling .
10482807|Partial kindling also induced long term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- of amygdala efferent transmission to ventromedial hypothalamus -LRB- VMH -RRB- and periaqueductal gray -LRB- PAG -RRB- in left and right hemispheres .
10482807|Depotentiation of amygdala efferent LTP by bilateral low frequency amygdala stimulation -LRB- LFS -RRB- -LRB- 900 pulses at 1 Hz , once daily for 7 days -RRB- selectively reduced LTP in right amygdala efferents .
10482807|Effects of LFS were not due to damage , as thresholds to evoke amygdala efferent response were unchanged .
10482807|These findings suggest that lasting change in affect following partial hippocampal kindling depends on LTP of right amygdala efferent transmission to PAG .
10482807|The parallel between the present findings and the FG-7142 experiments suggests that lasting changes in defensive response are dependent on LTP of right amygdala efferents to the PAG , however produced .
10482807|The findings suggest further that the spectrum of behavioral changes produced by partial kindling are dependent on changes in a variety of neural circuits , and that amygdala efferent transmission changes are responsible for changes in defensive behavior , but not predatory attack behavior .
10501203|GADD45 mRNA was detected by in situ hybridization , whereas fragmented DNA was detected using in situ nick end-labeling by the large -LRB- Klenow -RRB- fragment of DNA polymerase I.

10501551|A voxel-based whole brain analysis identified grey matter differences in an amygdala centered system relative to 15 age - and IQ-matched controls .
10501551|Increases were found in posterior parts -LRB- amygdala/peri-amygdaloid cortex , middle temporal gyrus , inferior temporal gyrus -RRB- , and in regions of the cerebellum .
10509837|The right amygdala exhibited decreased responses to fearful vocalizations as well as fear-specific inhibitory interactions with left anterior insula .
10509837|A region of the pons , implicated in acoustic startle responses also showed fear-specific interactions with the amygdala .
10509837|The data demonstrate : firstly , that processing of vocal emotion involves a bilaterally distributed network of brain regions ; and secondly , that processing of fear-related auditory stimuli involves context-specific interactions between the amygdala and other cortical and brainstem regions implicated in fear processing .
10510979|Effect of pirenzepine , a muscarinic M1 receptor antagonist , on amygdala kindling in rat .
10510979|The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of muscarinic M1 receptors on amygdala kindling in the rat .

10530728|Intact recognition of emotional prosody following amygdala damage .
10530728|ralph-adolphs@uiowa.edu Bilateral damage to the amygdala in a variety of animal species can impair emotional reactions to stimuli in several sensory modalities .
10530728|We examined two subjects with complete bilateral amygdala damage , and seven with unilateral amygdala damage , on a standardized task of emotional prosody recognition .
10530728|One of the bilateral amygdala subjects , whose lesions were restricted to the amygdala , was entirely normal in recognizing emotion in prosody on all tasks , the other , whose damage included substantial lesions also in extra-amygdalar structures , especially in right hemisphere , was normal on most , albeit not all , measures of emotional prosody recognition .
10530728|We suggest that the human amygdala 's role in recognizing emotion in prosody may not be as critical as it is for facial expressions , and that extra-amygdalar structures in right hemisphere may be more important for recognizing emotional prosody .
10530728|It remains possible that recognition of emotion in classes of auditory stimuli other than prosody will require the amygdala .
10561935|The present study examined associations of MRI volumetric measurements of the mammillary body , fornix , amygdala , and hippocampus to measures of episodic verbal and visual memory .
10561935|Significant associations were found between left hippocampal volume and the immediate , delayed , and percent retention scores of the Logical Memory Test ; between the left mammillary body volume and the Logical Memory Test delayed and percent retention scores ; immediate Visual Reproduction performance was significantly related to the right and left amygdala volumes , and right mammillary body volume ; only the right amygdala and right mammillary body volume were associated with the delayed Visual Reproduction trial .
10562726|Studies in humans and other primates have pointed to several structures that play a key role in guiding social behaviors : the amygdala , ventromedial frontal cortices , and right somatosensory-related cortex , among others .
10581226|Furthermore , the comparison of abstract and concrete words indicated that abstract word processing was associated with selective activations -LRB- right temporal pole and amygdala , bilateral inferior frontal cortex -RRB- , while no brain areas were more active in response to concrete words .
10584724|FINDINGS : The scans of the group with both disorders were closely similar to those of the schizophrenic group , in terms of both general structures and the structure of the amygdala-hippocampus .
10584724|However , the amygdala-hippocampus was significantly smaller on both sides than that of normal controls -LRB- left 4.1 vs 4.5 cm3 , p = 0.011 ; right 4.2 vs 4.99 cm3 , p < 0.0001 -RRB- .
10618008|Relative to the cerebral volume differences , the regional volumes of the subjects with schizophrenia were 94 % in the left and right amygdala , 94 % in the left and 95 % in the right hippocampus/amygdala , and 93 % in the left and 95 % in the right parahippocampus .

10619632|A strong -LRB- r = 0.86 , p < 0.003 -RRB- correlation exists between increased anxiety -LRB- more time spent in the closed arm -RRB- and the lateralization of serotonin in the amygdala .
10619632|Greater serotonin in the right versus left amygdala relates to greater anxiety .
10619632|These data support the hypothesis that the right hemisphere is involved in emotional states : increased serotonin in the right amygdala is related to anxiety , while cortical dopamine may be associated with attention to the environment .
10624542|BACKGROUND : Previous studies indicated an important role of the amygdala for emotional information processing .
10624542|We investigated a possible relationship between amygdala volumes , aggressive behavior , and dysthymia , in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy -LRB- TLE -RRB- .
10624542|RESULTS : There was a highly significant enlargement of left and right amygdala volumes in patients with dysthymia -LRB- right side , p < .000 ; left side , p = .001 -RRB- .
10624542|We found a significant positive correlation between left amygdala volumes -LRB- p = .02 -RRB- and a trend towards positive correlation between right amygdala volumes and depression -LRB- p = .06 -RRB- , as measured with the Beck Depression Inventory .
10624542|CONCLUSIONS : This is the second report of a relationship between amygdala volumes and depressed mood , confirming an earlier finding in patients with bipolar disease , and the first study reporting a correlation between amygdala volumes and depression .
10624542|Increased processing of emotional information might increase amygdala blood flow and subsequently , result in amygdala enlargement .
10624548|METHODS : We immunoquantified PLC beta 1 , gamma 1 and delta 1 in the left prefrontal cortex and superior temporal cortex , nucleus accumbens and amygdala , and in the right superior temporal cortex of postmortem brains obtained from a total of 19 patients with schizophrenia and a total of 27 controls .
10624548|There was no difference in PLC beta 1 immunoreactivities in the nucleus accumbens , the amygdala or the right superior temporal cortex between schizophrenic patients and controls .
10638409|There were positive correlations between rMRGlu in the middle right cingulate and grandiosity -LRB- r = 0.87 , P < 0.05 -RRB- , both the right amygdala -LRB- r = 0.90 , P < 0.01 -RRB- and the left posterior cingulate -LRB- r = 0.90 , P < 0.01 -RRB- to difficulties in abstract thinking , and the right frontal inferior -LRB- r = 0.85 , P < 0.05 -RRB- , right anterior cingulate -LRB- r = 0.93 , P < 0.01 -RRB- , and left anterior cingulate -LRB- r = 0.85 , P < 0.05 -RRB- to attentional deficits .
10643921|METHODS : Numbers of Fos-immunoreactive -LRB- Fos-ir -RRB- neurons in various hypothalamic regions were compared for three groups of animals : -LRB- a -RRB- unilateral amygdala-kindled , -LRB- b -RRB- implanted but unstimulated , and -LRB- c -RRB- unimplanted .
10676617|Single-voxel 1H MR spectroscopy of the white matter of each anterior temporal lobe was also performed , excluding the amygdala and hippocampus .
10680785|BACKGROUND : Previous studies have suggested that the perception of fear in facial expressions is mediated by a specialized neural system that includes the amygdala and certain posterior right-hemisphere cortical regions .
10680785|However , the neuropsychological findings in patients with amygdala damage are inconclusive , and the contribution of distinct cortical regions to fear perception has only been examined in one study .
10680785|The proposed special role of the amygdala and posterior right-hemisphere cortical regions in fear perception was also not supported .
10683827|Matching angry or frightened expressions was associated with increased regional cerebral blood flow -LRB- rCBF -RRB- in the left and right amygdala , the brain 's primary fear centers .
10683827|Labeling these same expressions was associated with a diminished rCBF response in the amygdalae .
10683842|Repeated visual stimulation resulted in neural habituation bilaterally in the secondary visual cortex and in the right medial temporal cortex including the amygdala and the hippocampus .
10688157|They categorised disgust as either anger or fear more frequently than paranoids , and demonstrated in response to disgust expressions activation in the amygdala , a region associated with perception of fearful faces .
10704753|Increased amygdala volumes in female and depressed humans .
10704753|ludger_vanelst@psyallg.ukl.uni-freiburg.de The amygdala are thought to play an important role in emotional information processing .
10704753|First studies indicate a link between amygdala atrophy , fear and aggression and between amygdala hypertrophy and depression .
10704753|To investigate a possible relationship between amygdala volumes , aggression and depression , we measured the amygdala of 62 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy -LRB- TLE -RRB- with and without aggressive behavior or depression and 20 healthy volunteers using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- .
10704753|Depressed patients displayed significant enlargement of both amygdala -LRB- left side : P = 0.008 ; right side : P = 0.001 -RRB- There was no significant finding relating to the factor aggression neither was there any significant interaction between aggression , dysthymia and gender .
10707898|Following 72-hr reperfusion , GFAP mRNA signal was observed in virtually the entire ischemic cortex , particularly the amygdala region , then gradually reduced and restricted to right MCA territory and subcortical thalamic nucleus following 2-week reperfusion .
10710158|In this study we analyze the effects of hemisphere , sex and age on size variability of the total cerebrum , cerebellum , lateral ventricles , temporal lobe , amygdala , hippocampus , superior temporal gyrus , corpus callosum , caudate , putamen , and globus pallidus in 115 healthy children and adolescents , ages 4-20 years .
10712653|Exposure to upright faces selectively increased expression significantly more in the right inferior temporal cortex than in the left , and active choice between upright faces additionally increased expression bilaterally in basal amygdala and hippocampus -LRB- CA1-4 -RRB- .
10712653|Exposure to inverted faces did not lead to enhanced activation in the right inferior temporal cortex , amygdala or hippocampus but instead increased expression levels in the diagonal band of Broca , parietal and cingulate cortices .
10712653|These results show that discrimination of upright faces in sheep preferentially engages the right temporal cortex , as it does in humans , and that performance of active choices between such faces may additionally involve the basal amygdala and hippocampus .
10722182|Quantitative MRI of the hippocampus and amygdala in severe depression .
10722182|BACKGROUND : There is little evidence to support possible structural changes in the amygdala and hippocampus of patients with severe depression .
10722182|METHODS : Quantitative MRI of the amygdala and hippocampus , as well as proton spectroscopy -LRB- MRS -RRB- of mesial temporal structures were studied in 34 drug-resistant in-patients with major depression and compared with 17 age-matched controls .
10722182|The patients , but not the controls , had significant asymmetry of the amygdalar volumes -LRB- right smaller than left -RRB- .
10722182|No differences were observed between the patients and controls in the T2 relaxation times for the hippocampus and amygdala .
10727625|Concentrations of DA,3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid -LRB- DOPAC -RRB- and homovanillic acid -LRB- HVA -RRB- in the lateral amygdala , nucleus accumbens , caudate-putamen , and medial prefrontal cortex were determined in the postmortem brains of lesioned and sham-operated rats on PD35 and PD56 .
10727625|On PD35 , concentrations of DA in the bilateral lateral amygdala and HVA in the left lateral amygdala were significantly increased in lesioned rats compared with sham-operated animals , while no significant change was observed in the other three brain areas .
10727625|On PD56 , in addition to the increased concentration of DA in the left lateral amygdala , those of DA , DOPAC and HVA in the caudate-putamen , and DA in the nucleus accumbens were found to be increased , but DA concentrations in the right medial prefrontal cortex were decreased .
10727625|The DOPAC/DA concentration ratio was , however , decreased in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens of the lesioned rats .
10727625|In an in vivo microdialysis study , methamphetamine -LRB- MAP : 2 mg/kg , i.p. -RRB- - induced DA release in the amygdala of lesioned rats was significantly enhanced compared with sham-operated rats on both PD35 and PD56 .
10729349|Right somatosensory-related cortices thus constitute an additional critical component that functions together with structures such as the amygdala and right visual cortices in retrieving socially relevant information from faces .
10729624|In this period of time , dipoles were concentrated in the right temporal pole , and the temporal pole and the amygdala in the most anxious subject .
10769253|Volumetry of hippocampus and amygdala with high-resolution MRI and three-dimensional analysis software : minimizing the discrepancies between laboratories .
10769253|Within the medial temporal lobe , both the hippocampus and amygdala are frequently targeted by researchers and clinicians for volumetric analysis based on magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- .
10769253|The hippocampal volume was larger in the right hemisphere -LRB- 3324 versus 3208 mm -LRB- 3 -RRB- -RRB- , while no interhemispheric differences for the amygdala -LRB- 1154 versus 1160 mm -LRB- 3 -RRB- -RRB- could be observed .
10769253|Most importantly , results from recent segmentation protocols for hippocampus and amygdala seem to approach each other with regard to mean volumes and interhemispheric differences .
10769253|This indicates that the advances in scanning technique , volume preparation and segmentation protocols allow a more precise definition of medial temporal lobe structures with MRI , and that results for mean volumes for hippocampus and amygdala from different laboratories will eventually become comparable .
10775518|The entorhinal cortex -LRB- Brodmann 's area 28 -RRB- is located at the anterior aspect of the parahippocampal gyrus ventral to the amygdala and the hippocampus .
10792453|Differential amygdala responses to winning and losing : a functional magnetic resonance imaging study in humans .
10792453|The amygdala has been shown to respond to many distinct types of affective stimuli , including reward and punishment feedback in animals .
10792453|The results showed that the parametric increase of winning was associated with left amygdala activation whereas the parametric increase of losing was associated with right amygdala activation .
10792453|These findings provide functional evidence that the human amygdala differentially responds to changes in magnitude of positive or negative reinforcement conveyed by lexical stimuli .
10797615|Unilateral injection of kainate into the right amygdala produced epileptic seizures , as well as selective degeneration of nerve cells restricted to the ipsilateral CA3 and CA4 regions of the hippocampus , followed by the development of gliosis .
10820211|Experiments have been run in awake , freely moving rats , implanted with a bipolar electrode in the right amygdala -LRB- for kindling stimulation -RRB- , and with a recording electrode and a microdialysis probe in the left hippocampus .
10825795|MRI revealed hematoma from the lower putamen to the medial temporal lobe including amygdala on the left .
10825795|We speculate that the hallucinations of the present case were produced by the dysfunctions not only of the temporooccipital and temporoparietal regions but also of the posterior inferotemporal cortex which has strong interactions with amygdala and works as the visual memory center .

10837507|ralph-adolphs@uiowa.edu Case studies of patients with bilateral amygdala damage and functional imaging studies of normal individuals have demonstrated that the amygdala plays a critical role in encoding emotionally arousing stimuli into long-term declarative memory .
10837507|However , several issues remain poorly understood : the separate roles of left and right amygdala , the time course over which the amygdala participates in memory consolidation , and the type of knowledge structures it helps consolidate .
10837507|We investigated these questions in eight subjects with unilateral amygdala damage , using several different measures .
10837507|For comparison , our main task used stimuli identical to those used previously to investigate emotional declarative memory in patients with bilateral amygdala damage .
10837507|Contrasts with both brain-damaged and normal control groups showed that subjects with left amygdala damage were impaired in their memory for emotional stimuli , despite entirely normal memory for neutral stimuli -LRB- because of a number of caveats , the findings from subjects with right amygdala damage were less clear -RRB- .
10837507|We stress the complex and temporally extended nature of memory consolidation and suggest that the amygdala may influence specific components of this process .
10843513|Test-retest reliability of resting regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose -LRB- rCMR -RRB- was examined in selected subcortical structures : the amygdala , hippocampus , thalamus , and anterior caudate nucleus .
10843513|Good test-retest reliability was found in the left amygdala , right and left hippocampus , right and left thalamus , and right and left anterior caudate nucleus .
10843513|However , rCMR in the right amygdala did not show good test-retest reliability .
10855761|Higher brain blood flow at amygdala and lower frontal cortex blood flow in PTSD patients with comorbid cocaine and alcohol abuse compared with normals .
10855761|CA-PTSD patients had significantly higher rCBF in right amygdala and left parahippocampal gyrus than normals during the ACPT .
10855761|The role of the amygdala in attention and fear conditioning suggests that increased amygdala rCBF may be related to clinical features of PTSD .
10855761|Cocaine use may be associated with increased amygdala rCBF in PTSD patients .
10883713|Schizophrenia , temporal lobe epilepsy and psychosis : an in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging study of the hippocampus/amygdala complex .
10883713|BACKGROUND : We have used proton magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy to measure hippocampus/amygdala volumes and anterior hippocampal metabolite concentrations -LRB- N-acetyl aspartate -LRB- NAA -RRB- , creatine/phosphocreatine and choline -RRB- in subjects with temporal lobe epilepsy -LRB- TLE -RRB- , schizophrenia and in normal controls .
10883713|Total hippocampus/amygdala volumes showed no significant differences in any of the groups when compared with normal controls .
10883713|When compared with controls significant , specific regional volume reductions were present bilaterally in the EP group and in the left hippocampus/amygdala in schizophrenia .
10883713|Specific regional hippocampus/amygdala volume reductions were more marked in the EP group and were bilateral .
10891648|During the task , activation of the right anterior medial temporal region including the amygdala was increased in the psychogenic amnesic patient .
10896168|OS activated amygdala-piriform , orbitofrontal , insular , and cingulate cortices and right thalamus .
10913507|A pilot study of amygdala volumes in pediatric generalized anxiety disorder .
10913507|Basic research has implicated the amygdala and circuits related to these nuclei as being central to several aspects of fear and fear-related behaviors in animals .
10913507|METHODS : Magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure amygdala volumes and comparison brain regions in 12 child and adolescent subjects with generalized anxiety disorder and 24 comparison subjects .
10913507|RESULTS : Right and total amygdala volumes were significantly larger in generalized anxiety disorder subjects .
10913507|CONCLUSIONS : Although these data are preliminary and from a small sample , the results are consistent with a line of thinking that alterations in the structure and function of the amygdala may be associated with pediatric generalized anxiety disorder .
10958248|Evidence that NMDA-dependent limbic neural plasticity in the right hemisphere mediates pharmacological stressor -LRB- FG-7142 -RRB- - induced lasting increases in anxiety-like behavior : study 3 -- the effects on amygdala efferent physiology of block of NMDA receptors prior to injection of FG-7142 and its relationship to behavioral change .
10958248|Unlike previous work , this study examined the effects of FG-7142 on LTP of amygdala efferents in both hemispheres .
10958248|7-amino-phosphono-heptanoic acid -LRB- AP7 -RRB- , a competitive NMDA receptor blocker , given prior to administration of FG-7142 , prevented LTP in amygdala efferent transmission to the medial hypothalamus and periacqueductal gray -LRB- PAG -RRB- .
10958248|A new finding is that increased local excitability in the right basal amygdala -LRB- reduced threshold for evoked response -RRB- , and LTP in the right amygdalo-PAG pathway , may be important for maintenance of increases in defensive behavior .
10959525|Regional CBF was attenuated bilaterally in the right and left prefrontal , temporal -LRB- including the amygdala -RRB- , parietal , and occipital cortices , and in the left orbitofrontal cortex .
10963985|Measurements were performed on contiguous 2.2-mm coronal MRI slices , which included , as well as the temporal lobe , the amygdala , the hippocampal formation , and the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle .
10963985|The definition of the hippocampus-amygdala interface was also validated in a correlated triplanar display .
10969937|OBJECT : Unilateral resection of the hippocampus and amygdala can be used to treat medically intractable mesial temporal lobe seizures .
10974353|radamec@play.psych.mun.ca In two complementary experiments , we studied the effects of low frequency stimulation -LRB- LFS -RRB- of the amygdala on behavioral effects of kindling in rats and cats .
10974353|These studies tested the hypothesis that kindling induced long term potentiation -LRB- KLTP -RRB- in amygdala circuits underlies interictal behavioral change .
10974353|In cats , the effects of LFS on KLTP of amygdala efferents was studied , and related to behavioral effects .
10974353|Partial ventral hippocampal kindling in cats and right amygdala kindling in rodents lastingly increased defensive response to rats in cats , and anxiety-like behavior -LRB- ALB -RRB- in the elevated plus-maze in rats .
10974353|Partial kindling also induced KLTP of amygdala efferent transmission to ventromedial hypothalamus -LRB- VMH -RRB- and periaqueductal gray -LRB- PAG -RRB- in left and right hemispheres .
10974353|Depotentiation of amygdala efferent KLTP by bilateral amygdala LFS selectively reduced KLTP in right amygdala efferents .
10974353|These findings suggest that lasting change in affect produced by kindling depends on LTP of right amygdala efferent transmission to PAG , replicating studies of the effects of FG-7142 on brain and behavior in the cat .
10974353|The findings suggest further that the spectrum of behavioral changes produced by partial kindling are dependent on changes in a variety of neural circuits , and that amygdala efferent transmission changes are responsible for changes in defensive behavior , but not attack behavior .
10974353|Effects of LFS were not due to damage , as thresholds to evoke amygdala efferent response were unchanged .
10974353|Bilateral but not unilateral amygdala LFS reversed the effects of kindling on risk assessment in the plus maze for at least 3weeks .
10974353|These findings are consistent with other studies which suggest that amygdala neuroplasticity in separable amygdala circuits mediates lasting changes in open arm avoidance and risk assessment .
10974353|Taken together , the findings of both studies support the hypothesis that a form of LTP of specific amygdala circuits underlies lasting changes in affect produced by limbic kindling .
10974355|Right amygdala kindling in adult female rats causes acyclicity , the development of polycystic ovaries and premature aging of the hypothalamic-pituitary neuroendocrine axis , leading to chronic anovulation and continuous estrogen exposure .
10974355|In contrast , right amygdala kindling increases serum testosterone , estradiol levels and gonadal weight .
10978480|Effects of baseline anxiety on response to kindling of the right medial amygdala .
10978480|radamec@play.psych.mun.ca The effects of kindling of the right anterior medial amygdala of Wistar rats was studied .
10978480|Subtle changes in focus location within the medial amygdala may have altered the effects of kindling on risk assessment .
10978480|The electrodes in this study were in a slightly but significantly different location in the medial amygdala than in previous studies .
10978494|Rodent anxiety and kindling of the central amygdala and nucleus basalis .
10978494|radamec@play.psych.mun.ca We studied lasting behavioral effects of kindling of three parts of the central nucleus of the amygdala and the anterior nucleus basalis in the right hemisphere of male Wistar rats .
10978494|These findings add to a growing body of evidence that suggests that subtle differences in location of a kindled focus within the rat amygdala lead to different behavioral outcomes .
10988036|Attribute-specific responses , independent of depth of processing , were evident in bilateral fusiform cortices for perceptual oddballs and left amygdala for emotional oddballs .

11022139|Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy versus amygdalar epilepsy : late seizure recurrence after initially successful amygdalotomy and regained seizure control following hippocampectomy .
11022139|hgwepi@neurol.unizh.ch We summarise the concept of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and the pros and cons in order to define amygdala epilepsy .
11022139|We present a patient with stereotactically proven right amygdalar seizure onset , associated with fear and vegetative autonomic signs and symptoms as the most prominent clinical ictal features .
11022139|A right-sided selective hippocampectomy and excision of the previously lesioned amygdala was performed .
11022139|This case underscores the important role of the amygdala in generating the semiology , and raises several questions concerning the existence of `` amygdalar epilepsy '' .
11022139|The 11-year seizure-free period following the stereotactic destruction of the amygdala is a strong argument for this notion .
11022139|The late seizure recurrence requiring a second operation might , however , be seen as an argument for the important role of the hippocampal formation in the syndrome of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy even when the amygdala has been identified as the seizure onset zone .
11027916|Aversive pictures , relative to neutral pictures , increased cerebral activity in bilateral amygdala , thalamic/hypothalamic area , midbrain , and left lateral prefrontal cortex , along with greater skin conductance responses -LRB- SCR -RRB- .
11027916|Voxel-by-voxel correlation coefficients between regional brain activity and SCR showed significant positive correlation peaks in the thalamus and right amygdala .
11035890|MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Volumes of cortical subdivisions , ventricular system , cerebellum , basal ganglia , corpus callosum , amygdala , and hippocampus , derived from structural magnetic resonance imaging scans and compared between preterm and term children ; correlations of regional brain volumes with cognitive measures -LRB- at age 8 years -RRB- and perinatal variables among preterm children .
11035890|001 for all -RRB- and smaller in the cerebellum -LRB- 6.7 % ; P = .02 -RRB- , basal ganglia -LRB- 11.4 % -13.8 % ; P < / = .005 -RRB- , amygdala -LRB- left , 20.2 % -LSB- P = .001 -RSB- ; right , 30.0 % -LSB- P < .001 -RSB- -RRB- , hippocampus -LRB- left , 16.0 % -LSB- P = .001 -RSB- ; right , 12.0 % -LSB- P = .007 -RSB- -RRB- , and corpus callosum -LRB- 13.1 % -35.2 % ; P < / = .01 for all -RRB- .
11055255|This study addressed these 2 contrasting findings by investigating amygdala and adjacent cortical contributions to the evaluation of facial emotion in 12 patients with right and 11 patients with left unilateral anteromedial temporal lobectomy -LRB- RTL and LTL , respectively -RRB- and 23 normal controls .
11055255|In addition , the right amygdala and adjacent cortex may be part of a neural circuit representing facial expressions of withdrawal .
11074055|Posterodorsal amygdala lesions reduce feeding stimulated by 8-OH-DPAT .
11074055|More recent work shows that small lesions of the posterodorsal amygdala -LRB- PDA -RRB- elicit overeating in their own right .
11074055|Since this and related regions of the amygdala receive 5-HT innervations from the dorsal raphe nucleus -LRB- DRN -RRB- , we determined if PDA lesions might alter feeding after injecting 8-OH-DPAT into this midbrain region .
11090722|Volumetric measurements of the hippocampi/amygdala showed a reduction in volume of 25 % on the left compared to right within cortical areas .
11097966|mehmet@petlab.mssm.edu OBJECTIVE : Cytoarchitectonic changes in the anterior cingulate cortex , hippocampus , subiculum , entorhinal cortex , amygdala , mammillary bodies , and septum were reported in a postmortem study of autism .
11097966|In this study , they measured the volume and glucose metabolism of the amygdala , hippocampus , and cingulate gyrus in an expanded group of 17 patients with autism spectrum disorders -LRB- autism -LSB- N = 10 -RSB- or Asperger 's disorder -LSB- N = 7 -RSB- -RRB- and 17 age - and sex-matched healthy volunteers .
11097966|The amygdala , hippocampus , and cingulate gyrus were outlined on magnetic resonance imaging scans , volumes of the structures were applied to matching coregistered positron emission tomography scans , and three-dimensional significance probability mapping was performed .
11097966|No group differences were found in either the metabolism or the volume of the amygdala or the hippocampus .
11117499|Deactivations were observed in the posterior cingulate gyrus and in the amygdala and were right-lateralized in the prefrontal , parietal and middle temporal cortices .
11124043|Sex-related difference in amygdala activity during emotionally influenced memory storage .
11124043|lfcahill@uci.edu We tested the possibility suggested by previous imaging studies that amygdala participation in the storage of emotionally influenced memory is differentially lateralized in men and women .
11124043|Consistent with suggestions from several previously published studies , enhanced activity of the right , but not the left , amygdala in men was related to enhanced memory for the emotional films .
11124043|Conversely , enhanced activity of the left , but not the right , amygdala in women was related to enhanced memory for the emotional films .
11124043|These results demonstrate a clear gender-related lateralization of amygdala involvement in emotionally influenced memory , and indicate that theories of the neurobiology of emotionally influenced memory must begin to account for the influence of gender .
11134388|Metabolite ratios between N : - acetylaspartate -LRB- NAA -RRB- , creatine and phosphocreatine -LRB- Cr + PCr -RRB- , and choline-containing compounds -LRB- Cho -RRB- -LSB- NAA / -LRB- Cr + PCr -RRB- , NAA/Cho , and NAA / -LRB- Cr + PCr + Cho -RRB- -RSB- were calculated for -LRB- 1 -RRB- H MRS voxels that included the amygdala , anterior half of the hippocampus , and underlying subiculum .
11137053|Significant increases in rCBF across the group of all 10 patients were located in the prefrontal cortex -LRB- L > R -RRB- , the cingulate gyrus -LRB- L >> R -RRB- , and the left amygdala , as well as bilateral insula , basal ganglia , uncus , hippocampus , parahippocampus , thalamus , and cerebellum .
11137053|Significant decreases in flow were noted in small areas of the right prefrontal cortex , left medial temporal cortex , left basal ganglia , and left amygdala .
11137053|CONCLUSIONS : These data indicate that 2 weeks of daily 20-Hz rTMS over the left prefrontal cortex at 100 % MT induce persistent increases in rCBF in bilateral frontal , limbic , and paralimbic regions implicated in depression , whereas 1-Hz rTMS produces more circumscribed decreases -LRB- including in the left amygdala -RRB- .
11150336|Within the medial temporal lobe , special attention has been paid to the hippocampus -LRB- HC -RRB- and amygdala -LRB- AG -RRB- because of their role in memory , depression , emotion , and learning .
11157555|The former may require cognitive processes of the lateral and superior medial frontal regions , the latter affective connections of the ventral medial frontal with amygdala and other limbic regions .
11160948|These findings support the view that attention is controlled by neural mechanisms involving not only frontoparietal areas but also limbic components in cingulate cortex and amygdala , which may interact with ventral visual areas in the temporal lobe to detect affective value and prioritize attention to salient stimuli .
11163602|To investigate the role of unilateral amygdala lesions on processing emotions , 22 drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy -LRB- TLE -RRB- subjects -LRB- 12 with left-sided and ten with right-sided focus -RRB- were tested , after anterior temporal lobectomy or selective amygdalo-hippocampectomy on two associative learning tasks containing emotional and neutral facial expressions , respectively .
11163602|Taken the extent of amygdala damage into account , an interaction effect could be shown between task -LRB- learning of neutral facial expressions versus emotional facial expressions -RRB- and group -LRB- subjects with little versus considerable amygdala damage -RRB- , indicating worse performance of subjects with considerable amygdala damage in learning emotional facial expressions .
11163602|Subjects with considerable amygdala damage were also significantly impaired in learning emotional facial expressions when compared with control subjects .
11164756|RESULTS : Depressed bipolar disorder patients compared to control subjects had decreased global , absolute prefrontal and anterior paralimbic cortical , and increased normalized subcortical -LRB- ventral striatum , thalamus , right amygdala -RRB- metabolism .
11166926|condes@servidor.unam.mx The anterior commissure , medial and lateral bed nuclei of the stria terminalis and both sides of the medial prefrontal cortex showed a progressive increasing of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase labeling -LRB- WGA-HRP -RRB- in successive stages of amygdaline kindling , after 48 h of a right amygdala WGA-HRP injection .
11166926|In contrast , during the first stages the number of labeled cells in the contralateral amygdala was reduced , reaching control values after the first generalized seizure .
11167039|The Cavalieri method was used in combination with point counting to provide unbiased estimates of the volume of the left and right hippocampus , amygdala , temporal lobe , lateral ventricles and cerebral hemisphere , and pixel by pixel maps of the T2 relaxation time were computed for both central and anterior sections of the hippocampus .
11198048|FG-7142 also induced long-lasting potentiation -LRB- LLP -RRB- of evoked potentials in a number of efferent pathways from the amygdala in both hemispheres .
11198048|Flumazenil given prior to FG-7142 blocked LLP in all but one of the amygdala efferent pathways , suggesting benzodiazepine receptor dependence of initiation of LLP .
11198048|These findings support the view that maintenance of lasting increases in defensive behaviour depend upon LLP of excitatory neural transmission between amygdala and lateral column of the PAG in the right hemisphere .

11198049|The hypothesis that long-lasting potentiation -LRB- LLP -RRB- in amygdala efferents to the periacqueductal gray -LRB- PAG -RRB- of the right hemisphere mediates initiation of lasting increases in defensive response to rats induced by FG-7142 was supported in this study .
11198049|GVG given 1 day prior to FG-7142 prevented increased defensive response to rats as well as LLP in right amygdala efferent transmission to the PAG .
11201095|In situ hybridization analysis revealed that intense silver grains for KGF mRNA are observed in the neuronal cells of the cerebral cortex , hippocampus and amygdala in gerbil brain .
11209954|Differential prefrontal cortex and amygdala habituation to repeatedly presented emotional stimuli .
11209954|Significant fMRI signal decrement was present in the left dorsolateral prefrontal and premotor cortex , and right amygdala .
11209954|In the amygdala , significantly greater habituation was observed on the right compared to the left .
11209954|In contrast , the left amygdala was significantly more activated than the right to the contrast of fear vs happy .
11209954|We speculate that the right amygdala is part of a dynamic emotional stimulus detection system , while the left is specialized for sustained stimulus evaluations .
11231097|jnoga@emory.edu Six monozygotic -LRB- MZ -RRB- twin pairs discordant for bipolar disorder were compared with normal MZ twins with magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- on volumes of basal ganglia -LRB- BG -RRB- , amygdala-hippocampus -LRB- AH -RRB- , and cerebral hemisphere .
11235858|Volumes of the medial temporal lobe structures -LRB- i.e. the amygdala , hippocampus , and parahippocampal gyrus -RRB- , Sylvian fissure , and inferior horn of the lateral ventricle relative to the cerebral hemisphere were measured in 24 patients with schizophrenia and 23 normal controls using magnetic resonance imaging .
11241871|Time courses of left and right amygdalar responses to fearful facial expressions .
11241871|spmamlp@iop.kcl.ac.uk Despite the many studies highlighting the role of the amygdala in fear perception , few have examined differences between right and left amygdalar responses .
11241871|Initial observation of extracted time series of both amygdalae to these stimuli indicated more rapid decreases of right than left amygdalar responses to fearful faces , and increasing magnitudes of right amygdalar responses to neutral faces with time .
11241871|We compared right and left responses statistically by modeling each time series with -LRB- 1 -RRB- a stationary fit model -LRB- assuming a constant magnitude of amygdalar response to consecutive blocks of fearful faces -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- an adaptive model -LRB- no assumptions -RRB- .
11241871|Areas of significant sustained nonstationarity -LRB- time series points with significantly greater adaptive than stationary model fits -RRB- were demonstrated for both amygdalae .
11241871|There was more significant nonstationarity of right than left amygdalar responses to neutral , and left than right amygdalar responses to fearful faces .
11241871|These findings indicate significant variability over time of both right and left amygdalar responses to fearful and neutral facial expressions and are the first demonstration of specific differences in time courses of right and left amygdalar responses to these stimuli .

11245690|The primate amygdala mediates acute fear but not the behavioral and physiological components of anxious temperament .
11245690|Regardless , indirect evidence from rodent studies and difficult to interpret primate studies is used to support the hypothesis that the amygdala plays a central role .
11245690|To examine the role of the amygdala in mediating this endophenotype and other fearful responses , we prepared monkeys with selective fiber sparing ibotenic acid lesions of the amygdala .
11245690|Unconditioned trait-like anxiety-fear responses remained intact in monkeys with > 95 % bilateral amygdala destruction .
11245690|These findings demonstrate that the primate amygdala is involved in mediating some acute unconditioned fear responses but challenge the notion that the amygdala is the key structure underlying the dispositional behavioral and physiological characteristics of anxious temperament .
11247926|c-Fos-labeled neurons were found bilaterally in the paraventricular and supraoptic hypothalamic nuclei , in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus , and in the central nucleus of the amygdala .
11257281|Differential amygdala activation during emotional decision and recognition memory tasks using unpleasant words : an fMRI study .
11257281|tabertm@pi.cpmc.columbia.edu This study used fMRI to examine the response of the amygdala in the evaluation and short-term recognition memory of unpleasant vs. neutral words in nine right-handed healthy adult women .
11257281|To establish specificity of the amygdala response , we examined the fMRI BOLD signal in one control region -LRB- visual cortex -RRB- .
11257281|The Talairach coordinates for the center of the amygdala were chosen before analysis .
11257281|These results are consistent with the memory modulatory view of amygdala function , which suggests that the amygdala facilitates long-term , but not short-term , memory consolidation of emotionally significant material .
11257281|The control area showed only an effect for Time Course for both the emotional decision and memory tasks , indicating the specificity of the amygdala response to the evaluation of unpleasant words .
11257281|Moreover , the right-sided amygdala activation during the unpleasant word condition was strongly correlated with the BOLD response in the occipital cortex .
11257281|These findings corroborate those by other researchers that the amygdala can modulate early processing of visual information in the occipital cortex .
11257281|Finally , an increase in subject 's state anxiety -LRB- evaluated by questionnaire -RRB- while in the scanner correlated with amygdala activation under some conditions .
11257787|Degeneration of central autonomic network , including the hypothalamus and the central nucleus of the amygdala , which has been shown in some ALS patients , might underlie the autonomic abnormalities in this patient .
11275483|In comparison with scrambled images , neutral faces activated the fusiform gyri , the right lateral occipital gyrus , the right superior temporal sulcus , the inferior frontal gyri , and the amygdala/entorhinal cortex .
11287374|Controls showed increased activity in the bilateral prefrontal and parietal cortex with increasing delay , whereas the patients had increased activity in the right prefrontal , anterior cingulate and left amygdala .
11287374|Increased activity in the right prefrontal cortex was associated with better memory performance in both groups and activity in the left amygdala was correlated with better performance in the patients .
11287374|Based on these task and behavioural effects , we examined functional connectivity of the right prefrontal cortex and left amygdala in both groups by determining those areas whose activity was correlated with activity in these regions .
11287374|Areas where activity was correlated with the left amygdala in patients included the bilateral posterior parahippocampal gyri , a number of left prefrontal regions , anterior and posterior cingulate , thalamus , and insula .
11287374|Controls had a relatively restricted set of regions where activity correlated with the left amygdala , mainly temporal and occipital areas .
11287374|The unexpected finding of increased involvement of the amygdala suggests that the patients may have processed the emotional content of the faces to a greater degree than did the controls .
11287374|Furthermore , the positive association between amygdala activity and memory performance in the patients suggests a possible compensatory role for an emotion-related network of regions .
11287799|We found higher DOPAC/DA ratios in the neostriatum , ventral striatum , frontal cortex and amygdala of the right hemisphere .
11296093|Compared with the neutral imagery control condition , imagery-induced drug craving was associated with bilateral -LRB- right hemisphere amygdala activation greater than left -RRB- activation of the amygdala , the left insula and anterior cingulate gyrus , and the right subcallosal gyrus and nucleus accumbens area .
11296093|CONCLUSIONS : The collected findings suggest the craving-related activation of a network of limbic , paralimbic , and striatal brain regions , including structures involved in stimulus-reward association -LRB- amygdala -RRB- , incentive motivation -LRB- subcallosal gyrus/nucleus accumbens -RRB- , and anticipation -LRB- anterior cingulate cortex -RRB- .
11301245|Cortical regions in the temporal lobe participate in perceiving socially relevant stimuli , whereas the amygdala , right somatosensory cortices , orbitofrontal cortices , and cingulate cortices all participate in linking perception of such stimuli to motivation , emotion , and cognition .
11304083|The bilateral amygdala , the hypothalamus , and the medial frontal cortices , were constantly activated during the F tasks , and considered to be associated with the behavioral significance of the presented familiar faces .
11312562|To better characterize this influence we applied focal ionizing radiation to a kindled epileptic focus in the rat amygdala .
11312562|The right and left basolateral amygdala and right frontal cortex were implanted with concentric bipolar electrodes .
11312562|Rats were kindled through a minimum of 10 stage 5 seizures by afterdischarge-threshold electrostimulation of the left amygdala , after which generalized seizure thresholds were determined prior to irradiation .
11312562|The left amygdala was exposed to single-fraction central-axis doses of either 18 or 25 Gy using a beam-collimated -LRB- 60 -RRB- Co source -LRB- 1.25 MeV -RRB- .
11320162|Although evidence from primates suggests an important role for the anterior temporal cortex in social behaviour , human research has to date concentrated almost solely on the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala .
11321792|From the viewpoint of the lesion , the memory disturbance was more severe when , in addition to the hippocampus , the entorhinal gyrus or amygdala was damaged .
11337538|RESULTS : Amphetamine increased rCBF in two mesial prefrontal zones -LRB- Brodmann 's areas 8 and 10 -RRB- , inferior orbital frontal lobe -LRB- area 11 -RRB- , brain stem -LRB- ventral tegmentum -RRB- , anteromesial temporal lobe -LRB- amygdala -RRB- , and anterior thalamus .
11338176|While mechanisms of spatial attention are impaired after parietal damage in neglect patients , intact visual pathways to the ventral temporal lobe and amygdala might still mediate distinct mechanisms of emotional attention .
11353739|Differential extrageniculostriate and amygdala responses to presentation of emotional faces in a cortically blind field .
11353739|One proposal is that this residual ability -LRB- affective `` blindsight '' -RRB- depends on a subcortical visual pathway comprising the superior colliculus , posterior -LRB- extrageniculate -RRB- thalamus and amygdala .
11353739|Here we report differential amygdala responses in G.Y. to presentation of fearful and fear-conditioned faces in his blind -LRB- right -RRB- hemifield .
11353739|These amygdala responses exhibited condition-dependent covariation with neural activity in the posterior thalamus and superior colliculus .
11353739|Our results provide further evidence that an extrageniculostriate -LRB- colliculo-thalamo-amygdala -RRB- neural pathway can process fear-related stimuli independently of both the striate cortex and normal phenomenal visual awareness .
11357132|Lesions of the human amygdala impair enhanced perception of emotionally salient events .
11357132|Here we consider that a critical function of the human amygdala is to enhance the perception of stimuli that have emotional significance .
11357132|In contrast , a patient with bilateral amygdala damage has no enhanced perception for such aversive stimulus events .
11357132|Examination of patients with either left or right amygdala resections shows that the enhanced perception of aversive words depends specifically on the left amygdala .
11357132|All patients comprehend normally the affective meaning of the stimulus events , despite the lack of evidence for enhanced perceptual encoding of these events in patients with left amygdala lesions .
11377407|Right amygdala volume in adolescent and young adult offspring from families at high risk for developing alcoholism .
11377407|METHODS : Magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure cerebral , amygdala , and hippocampal volumes in 17 high-risk adolescent and young adult offspring from multiplex alcoholism families and 17 age - , gender - , and IQ-matched control subjects without a family history for alcoholism or other substance dependence .
11377407|RESULTS : High-risk adolescents and young adults showed reduced right amygdala volume in comparison with control subjects .
11377407|Right amygdala volume was significantly correlated with visual P300 amplitude .
11377407|Because the amygdala tends to increase in volume during childhood and adolescence , smaller volumes in high-risk children may indicate a developmental delay that parallels delays seen in visual P300 amplitude .
11377408|RESULTS : Nicotine reduced rCBF in the left anterior temporal cortex and in the right amygdala .
11377408|Increases were observed in the thalamus , a region rich in nicotinic receptors , and reductions in limbic and paralimbic -LRB- amygdala , anterior temporal cortex -RRB- regions .
11377839|In four other epileptic patients , who were operated unilaterally at the anterior temporal pole , amygdala and hippocampus with the temporal gyrus partially spared , efferent suppression grew stronger in the ear ipsilateral to surgery .
11390634|A large body of literature implicates the amygdala in Pavlovian fear conditioning .
11390634|Prior to fear conditioning , rats received a large electrolytic lesion of the amygdala in one hemisphere , and a nucleus-specific neurotoxic lesion in the contralateral hemisphere .
11390634|Neurotoxic lesions targeted either the lateral nucleus -LRB- LA -RRB- , basolateral and basomedial nuclei -LRB- basal nuclei -RRB- , or central nucleus -LRB- CE -RRB- of the amygdala .
11390634|These results indicate that there is significant overlap within the amygdala in the neural pathways mediating fear conditioning to contextual and acoustic CS , and that these forms of learning are not anatomically dissociable at the level of amygdaloid nuclei .
11409730|Dispositional pessimism and amygdala activity : a PET study in healthy volunteers .
11409730|The present study used scores from Seligman 's Attribution Style Questionnaire and -LSB- 15O -RSB- water positron emission tomographic measurements of regional cerebral blood flow -LRB- rCBF -RRB- to investigate the relation between individual differences in dispositional pessimism and amygdala activity .
11409730|Using one-tailed tests , significant negative correlations were evident between pessimism scores , with low scores reflecting relatively more pessimism , and right -LRB- r = -0.60 ; p = 0.014 -RRB- and left amygdala rCBF -LRB- r = -0.53 ; p = 0.032 -RRB- .
11409730|These results extend previous neuroimaging findings in healthy subjects indicating a role for the amygdala in transient negative emotional states , and suggest that this multimodal brain region also is involved in more durable negative affects such as dispositional pessimism .
11430815|Activation of fusiform gyri by faces was strongly affected by attentional condition , but the left amygdala response to fearful faces was not .
11430815|These results reveal differential influences on face processing from attention and emotion , with the amygdala response to threat-related expressions unaffected by a manipulation of attention that strongly modulates the fusiform response to faces .
11431229|RESULTS : In the alcoholic patients , cue-induced craving before treatment elicited activation primarily in the subcortical-limbic region of the right amygdala/hippocampal area and in the cerebellum .
11431229|Comparison subjects showed no comparable amygdala or cerebellar activation during ethanol stimulation and demonstrated no change in activation pattern between measurements .
11431229|The presence of emotional aspects of craving is suggested by amygdala activation .
11438606|Involvement of human amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex in hunger-enhanced memory for food stimuli .
11438606|Left amygdala rCBF covaried positively with recognition memory for food items , whereas rCBF in right anterior orbitofrontal cortex covaried with overall memory performance .
11438606|Regression analysis of the neuroimaging data revealed that left amygdala and right lateral orbitofrontal rCBF covaried as a function of stimulus category -LRB- i.e. , food vs non-food -RRB- .
11438606|These results indicate the involvement of amygdala and discrete regions of orbitofrontal cortex in the integration of perceptual -LRB- food -RRB- , motivational -LRB- hunger -RRB- , and cognitive -LRB- memory -RRB- processes in the human brain .
11463511|Effect of riluzole on the acquisition and expression of amygdala kindling .
11463511|METHODS : A bipolar electrode was implanted in the right amygdala of rats .
11467919|Considerable evidence indicates that processing facial expression involves both subcortical -LRB- amygdala and basal ganglia -RRB- and cortical -LRB- occipito-temporal , orbitofrontal , and prefrontal cortex -RRB- structures .
11467919|Right neostriatum and left amygdala were activated when subjects made explicit judgements of disgust , bilateral orbitofrontal cortex when they made judgement of happiness , and right frontal and insular cortex when they made judgements about any emotion .
11468305|RESULTS : The authors confirmed the expected bilateral hippocampal atrophy in AD relative to controls , with involvement of the amygdala bilaterally and the right parahippocampal gyrus .
11468305|As predicted , the semantic dementia group showed more severe involvement of the temporal pole bilaterally and the left amygdala , parahippocampal gyrus -LRB- including the entorhinal cortex -RRB- , fusiform gyrus , and the inferior and middle temporal gyri .
11468305|Distinguishing the patients with semantic dementia was the severe global but asymmetric -LRB- left > right -RRB- atrophy of the amygdala , temporal pole , and fusiform and inferolateral temporal gyri .
11473792|Aversive learning in patients with unilateral lesions of the amygdala and hippocampus .
11473792|peper@psychologie.uni-freiburg.de The present study applied a visual half field paradigm with emotional facial expressions in patients with selective unilateral amygdalo-hippocampectomy -LRB- AHE -RRB- to elucidate the contributions of the left and right medial temporal lobe and amygdala to emotional learning .
11495391|MRI scans were analyzed using a digitizer system with volumes of hippocampus , amygdala , entorhinal cortex , parahippocampal gyrus , and whole cerebral cortex calculated .
11495391|RESULTS : Using MRI , the areas that best separated groups were left hippocampal and left amygdala volume , resulting in correct classification -LRB- patient vs. control -RRB- in 79 % of cases -LRB- sensitivity 77 % , specificity 82 % -RRB- .
11496145|Sex differences in amygdala activation during the perception of facial affect .
11496145|We used fMRI to examine sex differences in lateralized amygdala activity during happy and fearful face perception .
11496145|Happy faces produced greater right than left amygdala activation for males but not females .
11496145|Both sexes showed greater left amygdala activation for fearful faces .
11496145|These findings suggest that the lateralization of affective function may extend beyond the cortex to subcortical regions such as the amygdala .
11498423|The purpose of this study was to compare amygdalar and hippocampal volume ratios between right - and left-handed participants .
11498423|RESULTS : In right-handed participants , the amygdala and hippocampus -LRB- P < .001 for both -RRB- were significantly larger on the right side than on the left .
11498423|Right-to-left volume ratios differed significantly between right - and left-handed participants for both amygdalar -LRB- P < .02 -RRB- and hippocampal -LRB- P < .01 -RRB- structures .
11498423|Gender did not affect right-to-left amygdalar and hippocampal volume ratios in right - or left-handed participants .
11498423|CONCLUSION : Handedness , but not gender , seems to affect right-to-left amygdalar and hippocampal volume ratios .
11499994|Neither IQ nor basic perceptual function accounted for task performance ; however , there was a moderate negative correlation between extent of amygdala damage and overall performance .
11499994|Consistent with some prior studies , these findings support a role for the right anteromedial temporal lobe -LRB- including amygdala -RRB- in recognizing emotion from faces but caution in drawing conclusions from small group samples .
11508785|Volume measurement with magnetic resonance imaging of hippocampus-amygdala formation in patients with anorexia nervosa .
11508785|The purpose of our work was to evaluate the volume of hippocampus-amygdala formation -LRB- HAF -RRB- in patients with anorexia nervosa -LRB- AN -RRB- , being this structure a crucial target for the glucocorticoid action in the adaptative stress-response .
11513822|This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- to examine changes in amygdala activity during air-puff conditioning among adults .
11513822|A region-of-interest analysis demonstrated differential change in BOLD signal in the right but not left amygdala across CS + versus CS - viewing .
11513822|The amygdala is engaged by pairing of a light with an air puff .
11516444|Recognition of words presented in emotionally negative relative to emotionally neutral contexts was associated with enhanced activity in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , left amygdala and hippocampus , right lingual gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex .
11526999|METHODS : Surface-based anatomical modeling was applied to magnetic resonance data to obtain three-dimensional -LRB- 3D -RRB- average anatomical maps and measures of location , shape , asymmetry , and volume for the lateral ventricles , hippocampus , amygdala , and superior temporal gyrus in schizophrenic -LRB- n = 25 ; 15 male -RRB- and normal subjects -LRB- n = 28 ; 15 male -RRB- matched for demographic variables .
11526999|The right amygdala showed volume increases in schizophrenia patients versus controls .
11526999|CONCLUSIONS : Clear morphometric differences of the lateral ventricles , hippocampus , and amygdala indicate regional displacements and shape distortions in several functional systems in schizophrenia .
11549618|Deduction activated areas near right brain homologues of left language areas in middle temporal lobe , inferior frontal cortex and basal ganglia , as well as right amygdala , but not spatial-visual areas .
11549754|Results demonstrated that the sexual arousal experienced , in response to the erotic film excerpts , was associated with activation in `` limbic '' and paralimbic structures , such as the right amygdala , right anterior temporal pole , and hypothalamus .
11563738|In the brain , the following distribution of olanzapine was determined -LRB- mg/kg -RRB- : negative -LRB- cerebellum -RRB- , 0.22 -LRB- hippocampus -RRB- , 0.86 -LRB- midbrain -RRB- , 0.16 -LRB- amygdala -RRB- , 0.39 -LRB- caudate/putamen -RRB- , 0.17 -LRB- left frontal cortex -RRB- , and 0.37 -LRB- right frontal cortex -RRB- .
11564317|Additional evidence from case studies suggests that , within the medial temporal lobe , the amygdala is responsible for this modulation .
11568398|Greatest proportional variability in volumes was found for the lateral ventricles -LRB- 57 % -RRB- for the cerebral hemispheres -LRB- 8 % -RRB- in the mean volumes of the hippocampus , parahippocampal gyrus , amygdala , caudate nucleus , temporal pole and temporal lobe on the right and left sides of the brain .
11568398|However , the volume of the right amygdala was , prior to application of the Bonferroni correction to take account of 38 ~ multiple comparisons , found to be significantly smaller in the five most consistent high scorers compared to the five most consistent low scorers -LRB- t = 2.77 , p = 0.025 -RRB- .
11568425|Differential contribution of right and left amygdala to affective information processing .
11568425|Evidence for a differential involvement of the human left and right amygdala in emotional and cognitive behaviour is reviewed , with a particular emphasis on functional imaging results and case reports on patients with amygdalar damage .
11568425|The available evidence allows one to conclude that there is definitely a hemisphere specific processing difference between the left and right amygdala .
11568425|In spite of this , the following tentative proposals are made : the left amygdala is more closely related to affective information encoding with a higher affinity to language and to detailed feature extraction , and the right amygdala to affective information retrieval with a higher affinity to pictorial or image-related material .
11568425|Furthermore , the right amygdala may be more strongly engaged than the left one in a fast , shallow or gross analysis of affect-related information .
11568430|Right amygdalar and temporofrontal activation during autobiographic , but not during fictitious memory retrieval .
11568430|Selective activations of the right amygdala and the right ventral prefrontal cortex -LRB- at the level of the uncinate fascicle interconnnecting prefrontal and temporopolar areas -RRB- were found when subtracting fictitious from autobiographic retrieval .
11587889|Auditory perception of laughing and crying activates human amygdala regardless of attentional state .
11587889|sander@ifn-magdeburg.de Adequate behavioral responses to socially relevant stimuli are often impaired after lesions of the amygdala .
11587889|Using low-noise functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- , we investigated in which way the amygdala , auditory cortex and insula are involved in the processing of affective nonverbal vocalizations -LRB- Laughing and Crying -RRB- in healthy humans .
11587889|All conditions activated the amygdala similarly and bilaterally , whereby the amount of activation was larger in the right amygdala .
11587889|The mean signal intensity change with stimulation was much larger in the amygdala than in auditory cortex and insula .
11587889|The amygdala results seem to be in accordance with the right-hemisphere hypothesis of emotion processing which may not be applicable as strongly to the level of auditory cortex or insula .
11593556|RESULTS : Using artificial neural network to the same regions and data , both the sensitivity and accuracy were found higher than using the traditional discrimination function analysis method ; the indices of amygdala , hippocampus , parahippocampal gyrus , temporal lobe , and temporal horn , these five structures could completely differentiate AD from normal controls ; new cases were successfully diagnosed .
11595264|Within encoding , the type of strategy produced different brain activity patterns , with deep encoding being characterized by left amygdala and left anterior cingulate activation .
11596777|The brain structures identified as critically involved in these different components and levels of emotions are : the amygdala , considered as the structure where the external stimuli are appraised in terms of their emotional significance ; the insular cortex and the hypothalamus , crucially involved in the generation of the autonomic components of emotions ; the ventral striatum , which subserves the execution of stereotyped emotional action patterns and the ventro-medial frontal cortex , playing a critical role in functions of control and inhibition of socially unacceptable emotional responses .
11677064|Volumes were assessed by manually tracing bilateral hippocampus , amygdala and temporal lobes .
11677064|After adjustment for age and total brain volume , the amygdala was significantly larger in the schizophrenics than in the control subjects , and this volume increase was more pronounced on the left side .
11677064|There was a nearly significant left-greater-than-right asymmetry of the amygdala in the schizophrenic group but not in the normal group .
11701000|A dose of 1500 cGy -LRB- max dose 2535 cGy -RRB- was delivered in a single fraction to the patient 's right amygdala and hippocampus .
11704071|Increased amygdala response to masked emotional faces in depressed subjects resolves with antidepressant treatment : an fMRI study .
11704071|BACKGROUND : The amygdala has a central role in processing emotions , particularly fear .
11704071|During functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- amygdala activation has been demonstrated outside of conscious awareness using masked emotional faces .
11704071|METHODS : We applied the masked faces paradigm to patients with major depression -LRB- n = 11 -RRB- and matched control subjects -LRB- n = 11 -RRB- during fMRI to compare amygdala activation in response to masked emotional faces before and after antidepressant treatment .
11704071|Data were analyzed using left and right amygdala a priori regions of interest , in an analysis of variance block analysis and random effects model .
11704071|RESULTS : Depressed patients had exaggerated left amygdala activation to all faces , greater for fearful faces .
11704071|Right amygdala did not differ from control subjects .
11704071|Following treatment , patients had bilateral reduced amygdala activation to masked fearful faces and bilateral reduced amygdala activation to all faces .
11704071|CONCLUSIONS : Depressed patients have left amygdala hyperarousal , even when processing stimuli outside conscious awareness .
11704071|Increased amygdala activation normalizes with antidepressant treatment .
11734536|We measured neo-cortical evoked potentials in the right hemisphere prior to 25 days of electrical kindling of the medial frontal corpus callosum or amygdala and re-measured them either 1 or 21 days following the last kindling session .
11735840|RESULTS : Compared with healthy subjects , decreases in gray matter density were found in the left amygdala ; left hippocampus ; right supramarginal gyrus ; thalamus ; -LRB- orbito -RRB- frontal , -LRB- superior -RRB- temporal , occipitotemporal , precuneate , posterior cingulate , and insular cortices bilaterally in patients with schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder .
11735840|A group-by-age interaction for density was found in the left amygdala , owing to a negative regression slope of gray matter density on age in the left amygdala in patients compared with healthy subjects .
11735840|The decreased density in the left amygdala is more pronounced in older patients with schizophrenia .
11742591|Inhibition of nicardipine on amygdala kindling in rats .
11742591|faoqmc@public.qd.sd.cn AIM : To investigate the effects and mechanism of nicardipine , a calcium channel blocker , on amygdala kindling in rats .
11742591|METHODS : Constant current stimulations were delivered to the right amygdala of the rats once a day .
11742591|The effects of nicardipine on the development and seizure of amygdala kindling were observed and the content of amino acid neurotransmitters in the brain of kindled rats was determined .
11742591|kg-1 , ip -RRB- significantly retarded the development of amygdala kindling -LRB- P < 0.01 -RRB- ; 2 - 20 mg .
11742591|kg-1 of nicardipine inhibited amygdala kindled seizure dose-dependently , elevated the afterdischarge threshold , and reduced the Racine 's stage ; 20 mg .
11742591|kg-1 of nicardipine significantly increased the content of GABA , a kind of inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitter , in the brain of amygdala kindled rats -LRB- P < 0.05 -RRB- .
11742591|CONCLUSION : Nicardipine inhibits amygdala kindling in rats , and the inhibition mechanism may be related to the blockage of the voltage-operated calcium channels and the enhancement of GABAergic system action in the brain .
11749983|Because all the removals included lateral and inferior temporal neocortex together with amygdala , parahippocampal gyrus and varying amounts of hippocampus , a combined-lesion effect could not be ruled out .
11772693|By using T -LRB- 1 -RRB- - weighted magnetic resonance imaging slices taken perpendicular to the Sylvian fissure , volumes of the hippocampus , amygdala , anterior and posterior parahippocampal gyrus , and temporal pole CSF were measured in both hemispheres .
11772693|RESULTS : For Down 's syndrome , smaller volumes of the right and left amygdala , hippocampus , and posterior parahippocampal gyrus were significantly associated with greater age ; this association was not seen in the anterior parahippocampal gyrus .
11772693|The amygdala and hippocampus volumes were positively correlated with memory measures .
11773432|Verbal and nonverbal emotional memory following unilateral amygdala damage .
11773432|tony-buchanan@uiowa.edu The amygdala is involved in the normal facilitation of memory by emotion , but the separate contributions of the left and right amygdala to memory for verbal or nonverbal emotional material have not been investigated .
11773432|Fourteen patients with damage to the medial temporal lobe including the amygdala -LRB- seven left , seven right -RRB- , 18 brain-damaged , and 36 normal controls were exposed to emotional and neutral pictures accompanied by verbal narratives .
11773432|Subjects with left amygdala damage failed to show the normally robust enhancement of memory for verbal and nonverbal emotional stimuli .
11773432|The group with right amygdala damage showed the normal pattern of facilitation of memory by emotion for both verbal and nonverbal stimuli despite an overall reduction in memory performance .
11773432|Furthermore , subjects with left amygdala damage were disproportionately impaired on memory for emotional narratives as compared with memory for emotional pictures .
11773432|The latter finding offers partial support for a lateralized and material-specific pattern of the amygdala 's contribution to emotional memory .
11784442|Neural interaction of the amygdala with the prefrontal and temporal cortices in the processing of facial expressions as revealed by fMRI .
11784442|iidaka@info.human.nagoya-u.ac.jp Some involvement of the human amygdala in the processing of facial expressions has been investigated in neuroimaging studies , although the neural mechanisms underlying motivated or emotional behavior in response to facial stimuli are not yet fully understood .
11784442|We investigated , using functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- and healthy volunteers , how the amygdala interacts with other cortical regions while subjects are judging the sex of faces with negative , positive , or neutral emotion .
11784442|The results of subtraction between the conditions showed that the left amygdala , right orbitofrontal cortex , and temporal cortices were predominantly involved in the processing of the negative expressions .
11784442|The correlation analysis showed that activity in the left amygdala positively correlated with activity in the left prefrontal cortex under the negative minus neutral subtraction condition .
11784442|The psychophysiological interaction revealed that the neural responses in the left amygdala and the right prefrontal cortex underwent the condition-specific changes between the negative and positive face conditions .
11784442|These results may suggest that the left and right amygdalae play a differential role in effective processing of facial expressions in collaboration with other cortical or subcortical regions , with the left being related with the bilateral prefrontal cortex , and the right with the right temporal lobe .
11801297|radamec@play.psych.mun.ca We investigated the effects of predator stress on behavior and amygdala afferent and efferent neural transmission in rats .
11801297|Pathways studied were : ventral angular bundle input to the basolateral amygdala ; central and basolateral amygdala output to the periaqueductal gray -LRB- PAG -RRB- .
11801297|Predator stress appeared to potentiate right and depotentiate left hemisphere afferent amygdala transmission .
11801297|In contrast , predator stress potentiated amygdala efferent transmission to right and left PAG , depending on the amygdala nucleus stimulated .
11801297|Potentiation in left hemisphere amygdala afferents and efferents predicts anxiolytic-like effects , while potentiation in the right hemisphere amygdala afferents predicts anxiogenic-like effects .
11805245|The SemD , but not the FTD , group showed tissue loss in the anterior temporal cortex and the amygdala/anterior hippocampal region bilaterally .
11816318|We endeavoured to clarify the possible involvement of cytosolic choline in the amygdala -LRB- anterior medial temporal region -RRB- of juvenile subjects with MDD .
11816318|METHOD : A total of 11 age - and sex-matched MDD and control pairs aged 14 to 18 years participated in long-echo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging -LRB- 1H-MRSI -RRB- of the amygdala .
11816318|RESULTS : Subjects with depression demonstrated lower left amygdala Cho-Cr ratios , compared with control subjects -LRB- paired t = 2.624 , df 10 , P = 0.025 -RRB- .
11816318|Left amygdala NAA-Cr and right amygdala Cho-Cr and NAA-Cr did not differ significantly between subjects with depression and control subjects .
11816318|In subjects with depression , simple regression revealed a negative trend between left amygdala Cho-Cr and Beck Depression Inventory -LRB- BDI -RRB- score -LRB- F = 3.509 , P = 0.098 -RRB- .
11816318|Right amygdala NAA-Cr and Cho-Cr did not differ significantly .
11826070|Behavioral , ethological , and electrophysiological evidence suggests that the highly unpleasant , bitter taste of a concentrated quinine hydrochloride -LRB- QHCL -RRB- should activate the human amygdala .
11826070|Tasting QHCL significantly increased rCBF within the left amygdala relative to control conditions of tasting water and ECR .
11826070|Sucrose and water caused small to moderate rCBF increases in the amygdala relative to ECR , but sucrose did not significantly increase activity within either amygdalae relative to water .
11826070|These data indicate that the left amygdala responds robustly to QHCL and more moderately to nonaversive sapid stimuli , both pleasant and unpleasant gustatory stimuli activate the right posterior OFC , and the left inferior frontal pole/anterior OFC demonstrates valence-specific responses to aversive gustatory stimuli .
11830178|Glucose metabolism in the amygdala in depression : relationship to diagnostic subtype and plasma cortisol levels .
11830178|drevetsw@intra.nimh.nih.gov In a previous positron emission tomography -LRB- PET -RRB- study of major depression , we demonstrated that cerebral blood flow was increased in the left amygdala in unipolar depressives with familial pure depressive disease -LRB- FPDD -RRB- relative to healthy controls -LSB- J. Neurosci .
11830178|Finally , the relationship between amygdala metabolism and plasma cortisol levels obtained during the scanning procedure was assessed .
11830178|Glucose metabolism was measured using PET and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose -LRB- 18FDG -RRB- in healthy control -LRB- n = 12 -RRB- , FPDD -LRB- n = 12 -RRB- , DSD -LRB- n = 9 -RRB- and BD-D -LRB- n = 7 -RRB- samples in the amygdala and the adjacent hippocampus .
11830178|The left amygdala metabolism differed across groups -LRB- P < .001 -RRB- , being increased in both the FPDD and BD-D groups relative to the control group .
11830178|The left amygdala metabolism was positively correlated with stressed plasma cortisol levels in both the unipolar -LRB- r = .69 ; P < .005 -RRB- and the bipolar depressives -LRB- r = 0.68 ; .1 < P < .05 -RRB- .
11830178|In contrast , neither significant main effects of diagnosis nor significant relationships with plasma cortisol were evident in post hoc analyses of metabolism in the right amygdala or the hippocampus .
11830178|Preliminary assessment of BD subjects imaged during remission suggested that amygdala metabolism is also elevated in remitted subjects who are not taking mood-stabilizing drugs , but within the normal range in subjects taking mood stabilizers .
11830178|The correlation between left amygdala metabolism and stressed plasma cortisol levels may conceivably reflect either the effect of amygdala activity on corticotropin-releasing hormone -LRB- CRH -RRB- secretion or the effect of cortisol on amygdala function .
11832223|In contrast to existing segmentation procedures that only label a small number of tissue classes , the current method assigns one of 37 labels to each voxel , including left and right caudate , putamen , pallidum , thalamus , lateral ventricles , hippocampus , and amygdala .
11839367|RESULTS : Compared with control subjects , the subgroup of patients with Hamilton depression scores of 22 or greater demonstrated decreased absolute rCMRglu in right prefrontal cortex and paralimbic/amygdala regions as well as bilaterally in the insula and temporoparietal cortex -LRB- right > left -RRB- ; they also exhibited increased normalized metabolic activity bilaterally in the cerebellum , lingula/cuneus , and brain stem .
11850152|Cocaine cues elicited a higher degree of craving than has been previously reported and resulted in left hemispheric activation of lateral amygdala , lateral orbitofrontal cortex , and rhinal cortex and right hemispheric activation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and cerebellum .
11850635|In a parametric factorial design , trustworthiness ratings were correlated with BOLD signal change to reveal task-independent increased activity in bilateral amygdala and right insula in response to faces judged untrustworthy .
11850635|The findings extend a proposed model of social cognition by highlighting a functional dissociation between automatic engagement of amygdala versus intentional engagement of STS in social judgment .
11879358|METHODS : Under pentobarbital anesthesia , rats were fixed to a stereotaxic apparatus , and bipolar electrodes were implanted into the right amygdala .
11879358|EEG was recorded with an electroencephalograph ; stimulation of the amygdala was applied bipolarly every day by a constant-current stimulator and continued until a generalized convulsion was obtained .
11899666|-LSB- Individual typological characteristics of higher nervous performance and asymmetry of hippocampus and amygdala electrical activity in dogs -RSB- .
11899666|Electrical activity of the frontal cortex , dorsal hippocampus , basolateral amygdala and lateral hypothalamus of both hemispheres was recorded in nine dogs in the state of quiet wakefulness without any stimulation .
11899666|For the hippocampus and amygdala , in some dogs these conditions were the best in the theta and beta 2 ranges , in other animals -- in the theta and alpha bands .
11899666|In phlegmatic dogs , spectral densities in the theta range were higher in the left hippocampus than in the symmetrical structure , in sanguine animals spectral densities in the theta and beta 2 ranges in the hippocampus and amygdala were higher in the right hemisphere than in the left one .
11914552|Is the right amygdala involved in visuospatial memory ?
11914552|In this report , word learning and design learning tasks were carried out as well as MRI volumetric measurements of the hippocampus and amygdala in order to verify possible modality-specific correlations between function and structure .
11914552|Visuoverbal ratios differed between right and left TLE groups , as did laterality indices of hippocampal and amygdalar volumes .
11914552|Furthermore , correlations were found between the left hippocampal volume and verbal memory , and between the right amygdala and visuospatial memory .
11923633|Clinical studies involving patients who had temporal lobectomy surgeries have also revealed changes in emotional learning related to the degree of amygdala involvement .
11926209|Group analysis revealed significant deactivations within the right insula , the right amygdala , and the right striatum .
11927193|In an exploratory analysis , guessing -LRB- run 1 minus run 2 of the active task -RRB- accompanied activation of sensory-motor associative areas , and amygdala on the left side , whereas informed decision-making -LRB- run 2 minus run 1 -RRB- activated areas that subserve memory -LRB- hippocampus , posterior cingulate -RRB- and motor control -LRB- striatum , cerebellum -RRB- .
11950457|The amygdala , a brain region involved in fear and fear-related behaviors in animals , and its projections to the superior temporal gyrus -LRB- STG -RRB- , thalamus , and to the prefrontal cortex are thought to comprise the neural basis of our abilities to interpret social behaviors .
11950457|Larger amygdala volumes were previously reported in pediatric GAD ; however , the brain regions involved in social intelligence were not examined in this pilot study .
11960899|After controlling for the whole-brain declines in absolute metabolism , relative increases in regional metabolism from waking to NREM were found bilaterally in the dorsal pontine tegmentum , hypothalamus , basal forebrain , ventral striatum , anterior cingulate cortex and extensive regions of the mesial temporal lobe , including the amygdala and hippocampus , and in the right dorsal parietal association cortex and primary somatosensory and motor cortices .
11960899|The relative increases in glucose utilization in the basal forebrain , hypothalamus , ventral striatum , amygdala , hippocampus and pontine reticular formation are new observations that are in accordance with the view that NREM sleep is important to brain plasticity in homeostatic regulation and mnemonic processing .
11982446|Within both treated groups , and in responders regardless of treatment approach , improvement was accompanied by a decreased rCBF-response to public speaking bilaterally in the amygdala , hippocampus , and the periamygdaloid , rhinal , and parahippocampal cortices .
11982446|The degree of amygdalar-limbic attenuation was associated with clinical improvement a year later .
11982446|CONCLUSIONS : Common sites of action for citalopram and cognitive-behavioral treatment of social anxiety were observed in the amygdala , hippocampus , and neighboring cortical areas , ie , brain regions subserving bodily defense reactions to threat .
12013661|The content of cAMP was determined in the frontal cortex , hippocampus , amygdala , and hypothalamus of both hemispheres immediately after the retrieval of conditioned reaction one day after conditioning .
12013661|Positive correlations between the cAMP levels in symmetrical regions of the frontal cortex , amygdala , and hypothalamus were revealed in all the examined groups .
12015233|ralph-adolphs@uiowa.edu Recognition of emotion draws on a distributed set of structures that include the occipitotemporal neocortex , amygdala , orbitofrontal cortex and right frontoparietal cortices .
12015233|Recognition of fear may draw especially on the amygdala and the detection of disgust may rely on the insula and basal ganglia .
12023059|Volumes and asymmetries of the amygdala-hippocampus-complex -LRB- AHC -RRB- and sylvian fissure -LRB- SF -RRB- were determined using magnetic resonance imaging of subjects with schizophrenia from 12 uniaffected and 14 multiply affected families , and ten healthy controls .
12023067|PET findings disclosed mild but significant changes in the amygdala -LRB- right or left -RRB- and left posterior hippocampus , which could account for both the storage disturbance and the inability to associate episodic components .
12042183|RESULTS : In smokers , the fMRI signal was greater after exposure to smoking-related images than after exposure to neutral images in mesolimbic dopamine reward circuits known to be activated by addictive drugs -LRB- right posterior amygdala , posterior hippocampus , ventral tegmental area , and medial thalamus -RRB- as well as in areas related to visuospatial attention -LRB- bilateral prefrontal and parietal cortex and right fusiform gyrus -RRB- .
12042881|However , the system also includes a core , domain-specific component that is centred on the amygdala circuitry .
12050316|Initial stimulation changes in the right amygdala in the group of 10 patients with chronic assessment were predictive of therapeutic response -LRB- P = 0.018 -RRB- ; in addition , right chronic hippocampal perfusion changes correlated strongly with the long-term clinical efficacy of VNS -LRB- P = 0.004 -RRB- .
12050316|The long-term mechanism of clinically effective VNS may rely on mainly hippocampal/amygdala and thalamic inhibition .
12050316|Acute amygdala and chronic hippocampal perfusion changes are predictive of long-term therapeutic response in specific patient subgroups .
12052530|Body image distortion reveals amygdala activation in patients with anorexia nervosa -- a functional magnetic resonance imaging study .
12052530|In anorectic patients , stimulation with their own body image was associated with activation in the right amygdala , the right gyrus fusiformis and the brainstem region .
12062466|An increase glucose metabolism was also found in the follows : the medial and lateral septal nucleus , substantia nigra , hippocampus , frontal cortex , parietal cortex , piriform cortex , entorhinal cortex , accumbens nucleus , ventral and lateral nucleus of the thalamus , amygdala , and ventral nucleus of hypothalamus .
12086710|The human amygdala : a systematic review and meta-analysis of volumetric magnetic resonance imaging .
12086710|The structure and function of the human amygdala is attracting increasing attention in the scientific literature , particularly since the advent of high resolution magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- .
12086710|We carried out a systematic review of the published literature reporting left and right amygdala volumes from MRI in non-clinical subjects .
12086710|Our aim was to estimate the normal range of the volume of the amygdala and to account for heterogeneity of the measures .
12086710|The mean + / -95 % confidence interval for the left amygdala volume was 1726.7 mm -LRB- 3 -RRB- + / -35.1 , and right was 1691.7 mm -LRB- 3 -RRB- + / -37.2 .
12086710|The amygdala is significantly larger in men and shows an inverse correlation with age .
12086710|The main methodological factor found to influence amygdala measurement was anatomical definition .
12086710|We conclude by putting forward a detailed operationalized anatomical delineation of the amygdala , based on Watson 's criteria .
12086710|This work should guide future research in obtaining accurate and reliable amygdala volume measures which in turn will aid comparisons with clinical groups and the specification of structural-functional relationships .
12091206|Group differences in volumes of the hippocampus , amygdala , planum temporale , and Heschl 's gyrus were tested .
12091206|Paranoid and nonparanoid patients differed in left amygdala volume .
12099486|The results showed that both the predominant activation in young subjects and reduced activity in old subjects contributed to a significant age difference in the left amygdala during the perception of negative faces .
12099486|These results indicate the age-associated vulnerability of the medial temporal lobe structures including the amygdala , hippocampus , and parahippocampal gyrus during face perception .
12099486|The dissociation with reduced activity in the left amygdala and the right parahippocampal gyrus may suggest that aging differentially affects neural responses to faces with negative or positive emotional valence .
12105126|Neonatal exposure to cocaine : altered dopamine levels in the amygdala and behavioral outcomes in the developing rat .
12105126|tsummavi@ibmc.up.pt The amygdala is a brain region that is known to be implicated in the development of behavioral sensitization to cocaine .
12105126|This study aimed to evaluate the effects of neonatal exposure to cocaine on the levels of neurotransmitters in the amygdala of developing rats and to relate these levels with open-field observations , mainly rearing behavior , that is regarded to reflect emotional components .
12105126|In PND30 , rats were decapitated , and the amygdala dissected from both brain hemispheres and processed for determination of dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- and metabolites by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection -LRB- HPLC-EC -RRB- .
12105126|In PND30 , there was a significant decrease in rearing and in global activity in the group exposed to cocaine , and DA levels were significantly decreased in the amygdala of the same group .
12105126|No differences were found between the left and right amygdala .
12105126|These results suggest that chronic neonatal cocaine administration leads to depletion of DA levels in the amygdala , which is consistent with previous findings .
12105126|These results can help to clarify the role of amygdala in cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization in the developing rat .
12111339|RCBF also increased in the right amygdala and in the periaqueductal gray matter adjacent to the pons .
12111358|Magnetic resonance images showed high signal intensity on T2-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion-recovery images in the cerebral cortex of right frontal convexity in case 1 and in the medial temporal lobe and anterior amygdala in case 2 .
12111358|In case 2 , a ganglioglioma was also found in the amygdala .
12114004|RESULTS : During anticipatory anxiety we found hypoactivity in the precentral gyrus , the inferior frontal gyrus , the right amygdala , and the anterior insula in PD patients compared to control subjects .
12145327|Men activated significantly more structures than women in a network that included the right amygdala , whereas women activated significantly fewer structures in a network that included the left amygdala .
12151285|Regions of interest , specifically the amygdala-hippocampus complex and the temporal lobes , were traced semi-automatically by three masked raters with good inter-and intrarater reliability .
12165365|In this MR study we used a 3D shape representation technique , based on spherical harmonic functions , to analyze left and right amygdala-hippocampus shapes in each of 15 patients with schizophrenia and 15 healthy controls matched for age , gender , handedness and parental socioeconomic status .
12165365|Left/right amygdala-hippocampal asymmetry , however , was significantly larger in patients than controls for both relative volume and shape .
12165365|The local brain regions responsible for the left/right asymmetry differences in patients with schizophrenia were in the tail of the hippocampus -LRB- including both the inferior aspect adjacent to parahippocampal gyrus and the superior aspect adjacent to the lateral geniculate nucleus and more anteriorly to the cerebral peduncles -RRB- and in portions of the amygdala body -LRB- including the anterior-superior aspect adjacent to the basal nucleus -RRB- .
12165365|An evaluation of shape deformations also suggests local abnormalities in the amygdala-hippocampal complex in schizophrenia .
12165379|Differential amygdala response during facial recognition in patients with schizophrenia : an fMRI study .
12165379|ac.jp Human lesion or neuroimaging studies suggest that amygdala is involved in facial emotion recognition .
12165379|To investigate amygdala responses during facial recognition in schizophrenia , we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- study with 12 right-handed medicated patients with schizophrenia and 12 age - and sex-matched healthy controls .
12165379|Positive face discrimination activated the bilateral amygdalae of both controls and schizophrenics , with more prominent activation of the right amygdala shown in the schizophrenic group .
12165379|Negative face discrimination activated the bilateral amygdalae in the schizophrenic group whereas the right amygdala alone in the control group , although no significant group difference was found .
12165379|Exaggerated amygdala activation during emotional intensity judgment found in the schizophrenic patients may reflect impaired gating of sensory input containing emotion .
12167256|Is the human amygdala critical for the subjective experience of emotion ?
12167256|Evidence of intact dispositional affect in patients with amygdala lesions .
12167256|It is thought that the human amygdala is a critical component of the neural substrates of emotional experience , involved particularly in the generation of fear , anxiety , and general negative affectivity .
12167256|Although many neuroimaging studies demonstrate findings consistent this notion , little evidence of altered emotional experience following amygdala damage has been gathered in humans .
12167256|In a preliminary test of the amygdala 's role in phenomenal affective states , we assessed the extent of experienced positive and negative affective states in patients with amygdala damage and age - , sex - , and education-matched controls .
12167256|In the first study , we examined the effects of amygdala lesions on affective traits in 10 left and 10 right amygdala-damaged patients , 1 patient with bilateral amygdala damage -LRB- SP -RRB- , and 20 control subjects .
12167256|In a second study , we examined more closely the effects of bilateral amygdala damage on the day-to-day generation of affective states by administering the PANAS daily for a 30-day period to patient SP and age - , sex - , and education-matched controls .
12167256|In both experiments , no differences in the magnitude and frequency of self-reported positive or negative affect were found between control subjects and patients with amygdala damage .
12167256|A highly similar two-factor description of experienced affect was found in patients with amygdala lesions .
12167256|This suggests that the underlying structure of affective states was intact following amygdala damage .
12167256|It is concluded that the human amygdala may be recruited during phenomenal affective states in the intact brain , but is not necessary for the production of these states .
12169258|Previous neuroimaging studies indicate that the human amygdala activates during exposure to aversive visual , olfactory and gustatory stimuli .
12169258|To examine amygdala responses to aversive auditory stimuli , we exposed healthy human subjects to unpleasant sounds while regional cerebral blood flow -LRB- rCBF -RRB- was assayed with O-15 PET .
12169258|Relative to white noise , the aversive sounds produced significant rCBF increases in the lateral amygdala/claustrum region .
12169258|These data indicate that the amygdala responds to aversive auditory stimuli in a manner similar to its response to unpleasant stimuli in other sensory modalities .
12169267|Levels of brain metabolites were determined in the right medial temporal lobe region -LRB- encompassing the whole amygdala and part of the hippocampus -RRB- and in the medial prefrontal cortex on the basis of previous work with both structural and functional neuroimaging techniques .
12176075|These components include the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- , amygdala -LRB- AMY -RRB- , nucleus accumbens -LRB- Nac -RRB- , subiculum -LRB- SUB -RRB- of the hippocampal formation , and the dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- neurons in the ventral tegmental area -LRB- VTA -RRB- .
12180994|Regional BOLD signal-intensity changes were observed during seizures at the seizure focus and ipsilateral amygdala .
12180994|During unilateral electrographic seizures , focal BOLD signal changes occurred at the seizure focus and ipsilateral amygdala , suggesting the presence of a cortico-subcortical loop .
12208011|Critically , fearful faces activated the left amygdala and extrastriate cortex both when seen and when extinguished ; as well as bilateral orbitofrontal and intact right superior parietal areas .
12208011|Comparison of perceived versus extinguished faces revealed no difference in amygdala for fearful faces .
12208011|These results demonstrate that amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex can be activated by emotional stimuli even without awareness after parietal damage ; and that substantial unconscious residual processing can occur within spared brain areas well beyond visual cortex , despite neglect and extinction .
12218703|In a placebo-controlled , balanced order design in eight male volunteers , the 5-HT -LRB- 2c -RRB- agonist , m-chlorophenylpiperazine -LRB- mCPP -RRB- increased blood oxygen level dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- signal in the hypothalamus , caudate , pallidum , amygdala and pyriform cortex , anterior cingulate gyrus and choroid plexus -LRB- p < 0.001 uncorrected -RRB- , areas with high density of 5-HT -LRB- 2c -RRB- receptors .
12218709|RESULTS : Treatment responders -LRB- defined by reduction in BDI score of > or = 30 % -RRB- had significantly less pretreatment blood flow in the left amygdala compared with nonresponders .
12237210|Hippocampal complex , amygdala , red nucleus , brainstem and cerebellum were activated in response to painful stimuli .
12242056|Low glial numbers in the amygdala in major depressive disorder .
12242056|BACKGROUND : Functional imaging studies implicate the prefrontal cortex and amygdala in major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder , and glial decreases have been reported in the prefrontal cortex .
12242056|Here , glia and neurons were counted in the amygdala and entorhinal cortex in major depressive disorder , bipolar disorder , and control cases .
12242056|RESULTS : Glial density and the glia/neuron ratio were substantially reduced in the amygdala in major depressive disorder cases .
12242056|CONCLUSIONS : Glia are reduced in the amygdala in major depressive disorder , especially on the left side .
12244085|Patients with the temporal variant of FTD -LRB- tvFTD -RRB- are particularly at risk for developing deficits in emotional processing secondary to atrophy in the amygdala , anterior temporal cortex -LRB- ATC -RRB- and orbital frontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- , structures that are components of the brain 's emotional processing systems .
12244085|We examined one aspect of emotional processing , namely the comprehension of facial expressions of emotion -LRB- emotional comprehension -RRB- in nine individuals with tvFTD , and correlated performance on this measure with atrophy -LRB- as measured from T -LRB- 1 -RRB- - weighted MRI scans by region of interest analysis -RRB- in the amygdala , ATC and OFC .
12244085|Emotional comprehension was correlated with atrophy in the right amygdala and the right OFC , and not with atrophy in other structures .
12244085|When individual profiles of amygdala atrophy were examined across patients and compared with control values , right amygdala atrophy was always accompanied by left amygdala atrophy , whereas patients with volume loss in the left amygdala could have normal or decreased right amygdala volumes .
12244085|Thus , emotional comprehension appeared to be most impaired when bilateral amygdala atrophy was present , and was not associated with the degree of left amygdala atrophy .
12325307|The two functions are known to be subserved by common neuroanatomical structures , including orbitofrontal cortex , mediodorsal thalamus , and the amygdala .
12372665|Here we show amounts of dopaminergic proteins in the amygdala , a key brain structure involved in the integration of emotions and stress , in subjects with major depression and in psychiatrically normal control subjects .
12377162|The analyses were subsequently restricted to voxels within the amygdala-hippocampal complex using the SPM small-volume correction .
12377162|This identified gray matter decreases in the schizophrenics , at the corrected voxel level -LRB- P < 0.05 -RRB- , in the left and right uncus and parahippocampal gyri and the right amygdala .
12394703|On the other hand , intravesical ice water instillation significantly activated several regions in frontal and parietal lobes , amygdala-hippocampus area and crus cerebri ventral border .
12409155|sftaylor@umich.edu Using salient pictures with aversive -LRB- AV -RRB- and non-aversive -LRB- NA -RRB- content , we probed limbic-emotional function in schizophrenia , testing specific hypotheses that the amygdala would exhibit abnormal activity and a relationship with positive symptoms .
12409155|Activity in the left amygdala correlated with positive symptoms in the patients .
12409155|Overall , the data are consistent with a general failure to process salient stimuli in schizophrenia , and the findings support the involvement of the amygdala in the positive symptoms of schizophrenia .
12409156|Decreased left amygdala and hippocampal volumes in young offspring at risk for schizophrenia .
12409156|Morphometric comparisons of the right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- , and the anterior and posterior amygdala-hippocampal -LRB- A-H -RRB- complex were conducted using high-resolution whole brain T -LRB- 1 -RRB- weighted brain images .
12411713|The effectiveness of Hering 's nerve stimulation in controlling penicillin-induced seizures in the rat is dependent on the amygdala .
12411713|richard.tubbs@ccc.uab.edu OBJECTIVE : This study tests the hypothesis that the ability of Hering 's nerve stimulation -LRB- HNS -RRB- to blunt seizure activity is dependent on the availability of dopamine in the amygdala .
12411713|After the recurrence of seizure activity , the left basolateral amygdala was injected with 1.0 microl of normal saline , dopamine , haloperidol or 1 % lidocaine in sequential tests .
12411713|HNS decreased seizure activity , but infusion of haloperidol or lidocaine into the basolateral amygdala blocked this antiseizure effect of HNS .
12411713|None of the amygdala injections altered the latency or amplitude of seizure activity .
12411713|CONCLUSION : These results demonstrate that the ability of HNS to blunt seizure activity in the rat is dependent on an intact dopamine system in the basolateral amygdala .
12434631|-LSB- Volumetric measurements of the hippocampus and amygdala with MRI in healthy adults -RSB- .
12434631|In recent years several studies have shown the utility of the volumetric measurement of the medial temporal lobe structures , especially the amygdala and the hippocampus in temporal lobe epilepsy , memory disorders , Alzheimer disease and schizophrenia .
12434631|AIM : The purpose of this study was to measure and establish our normal values of the hippocampus and amygdala volumes .
12434631|To determine the anatomic boundaries of the hippocampus and the amygdala the authors followed a generally accepted protocol previously described by C. Watson .
12434631|The mean asymmetry between the right and left hippocampus and amygdala was 3.17 % and 3.48 % , respectively .
12438464|VBM was used to characterise whole brain grey matter concentration , while the Cavalieri method of modern design stereology in conjunction with point counting was used to estimate hippocampal and amygdala volume .
12438464|RESULTS : LSSO and RSSO patients showed significant reductions in volume -LRB- using stereology -RRB- and grey matter concentration -LRB- using VBM -RRB- of the hippocampus , but not of the amygdala , in the presumed epileptogenic zone when compared with controls , but hippocampal -LRB- and amygdala -RRB- volume and grey matter concentration were not related to duration or age of onset of epilepsy .
12438464|Left amygdala volume was also reduced in LSSO patients with a history of childhood convulsions .
12454910|Right amygdala and auditory cortex were activated only by unpleasant words , while left frontal pole was activated only by pleasant words .
12468016|At baseline , the mean metabolism was increased in the left and right lateral orbital cortex/ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- , left amygdala , and posterior cingulate cortex , and decreased in the subgenual ACC and dorsal medial/dorsal anterolateral PFC in the unmedicated depressives relative to controls , consistent with the results of previous studies .
12468016|Following treatment , metabolism significantly decreased in the left amygdala and left subgenual ACC , and corresponding changes in the orbital and posterior cingulate cortices approached significance .
12468016|The metabolic reduction in the amygdala and right subgenual ACC appeared largely limited to those subjects who both responded to treatment and remained well at 6 months follow-up , in whom the reduction in amygdala metabolism tightly correlated with the reduction in HDRS scores .
12468016|The magnitude of the treatment-associated , metabolic change in the amygdala also correlated positively with the change in the stressed plasma cortisol levels measured during scanning .
12468016|Chronic antidepressant drug treatment reduces metabolism in the amygdala and ventral ACC in subjects showing a persistent , positive treatment response .
12470133|abrody@ucla.edu BACKGROUND : In functional brain imaging studies , exposure to cues related to cocaine , opiates , and alcohol in dependent individuals is associated with activation of the anterior cingulate gyrus , amygdala , orbitofrontal cortex , and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex .
12477704|Hippocampal , amygdalar and global brain atrophy on brain MRI have been proposed as early markers of Alzheimer 's disease .
12477704|In the Rotterdam Scan Study , a population-based study of age-related brain changes in 1077 non-demented people aged 60-90 years , we investigated the association between plasma homocysteine levels and severity of hippocampal , amygdalar and global brain atrophy on MRI .
12477704|We used axial T -LRB- 1 -RRB- - weighted MRIs to visualize global cortical brain atrophy -LRB- measured semi-quantitatively ; range 0-15 -RRB- and a 3D HASTE -LRB- half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin echo -RRB- sequence in 511 participants to measure hippocampal and amygdalar volumes .
12477704|We had non-fasting plasma homocysteine levels in 1031 of the participants and in 505 of the participants with hippocampal and amygdalar volumes .
12477704|No association was observed between plasma homocysteine levels and amygdalar atrophy .
12482078|Human amygdala responses to fearful eyes .
12482078|Fearful facial expressions evoke increased neural responses in human amygdala .
12482078|We used event-related fMRI to investigate whether eye or mouth components of a fearful face are critical in evoking this increased amygdala activity .
12482078|FE faces evoked specific responses in left anterior amygdala .
12482078|FN faces evoked responses in bilateral posterior amygdala and superior colliculus .
12482078|Responses in right amygdala , superior colliculus , and pulvinar exhibited significant time x condition interactions with respect to faces with fearful eyes -LRB- FF , FN -RRB- vs neutral eyes -LRB- NF , NN -RRB- .
12482078|These data indicate that fearful eyes alone are sufficient to evoke increased amygdala activity .
12482078|In addition , however , left amygdala displayed discriminatory responses to fearful eyes in different configural contexts -LRB- i.e. , in FF and FN faces -RRB- .
12482078|These results suggest , therefore , that human amygdala responds to both feature-specific and configural aspects of fearful facial expressions .
12482682|lfcahill@uci.edu On the basis of recent evidence indicating a sex-related lateralization of amygdala function in memory for emotional events , together with substantial evidence suggesting hemispheric specialization in processing global -LRB- central -RRB- versus local -LRB- detail -RRB- aspects of a situation , and the established dependence of the amygdala 's memory modulating function on beta-adrenergic receptor activation , we predicted differential effects of a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist -LRB- propranolol -RRB- on long-term memory for an emotionally arousing story in men and women .
12482682|Additionally , they provide support for the hypothesis that , in this paradigm , emotional arousal enhances long-term memory for central information in men via activation of right amygdala/hemisphere function , and enhances long-term memory for peripheral details in women via activation of left amygdala/hemisphere function .
12495531|Impaired recognition of social emotions following amygdala damage .
12495531|ralph-adolphs@uiowa.edu Lesion , functional imaging , and single-unit studies in human and nonhuman animals have demonstrated a role for the amygdala in processing stimuli with emotional and social significance .
12495531|To test the hypothesis that the recognition of social emotions depends on the amygdala , we administered the same stimuli to 30 subjects with unilateral amygdala damage -LRB- 16 left , 14 right -RRB- , 2 with bilateral amygdala damage , 47 brain-damaged controls , and 19 normal controls .
12495531|Compared with controls , subjects with unilateral or bilateral amygdala damage were impaired when recognizing social emotions ; moreover , they were more impaired in recognition of social emotions than in recognition of basic emotions , and , like previously described patients with autism , they were impaired also when asked to recognize social emotions from the eye region of the face alone .
12495531|The findings suggest that the human amygdala is relatively specialized to process stimuli with complex social significance .
12495531|The results also provide further support for the idea that some of the impairments in social cognition seen in patients with autism may result from dysfunction of the amygdala .
12498747|We found that visual perception of famous faces activated the inferior occipital gyri , lateral fusiform gyri , the superior temporal sulcus , and the amygdala .
12498956|At a more flexible statistical threshold -LRB- P < 0.001 , uncorrected for multiple comparisons -RRB- , circumscribed foci of significant gray matter reduction were also detected in the right amygdala/enthorinal cortex , the anterior and posterior borders of the superior temporal gyrus bilaterally , and the anterior portion of the left middle temporal gyrus .
12507445|Instead , the WS participants showed significantly reduced activation in the temporal lobes coupled with significantly greater activation in the right amygdala .
12507690|Habituation of blood-oxygenation-level-dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- signal during exposure to face stimuli , collapsed over fearful and neutral expressions , was evident in the right amygdala and hippocampus , as well as in the medial/inferior temporal cortex bilaterally .
12515451|We propose that the interictal discharges on the right frontal-temporal area likely arose from the amygdala , which activated the pontine nuclei responsible for PGO -LRB- ponto-geniculo-occipital -RRB- spikes and the rapid eye movements seen in our patient .
12535960|Effects of basolateral amygdala dopamine depletion on the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortical dopamine responses to stress .
12535960|In vivo voltammetry was used to study the effects of basolateral amygdala dopamine depletion on stress-induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex .
12535960|Male Long-Evans rats received bilateral microinjections of 6-hydroxydopamine or vehicle into the basolateral amygdala .
12535960|The results indicate that the nucleus accumbens dopamine responses to both stressors are significantly potentiated by dopamine-depleting lesions to basolateral amygdala .
12535960|Therefore , basolateral amygdala dopamine depletion had opposite effects on the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortical dopamine responses to stress , although the effect on the latter is lateralized to the right hemisphere in a stressor-specific manner .
12538412|Mesial temporal damage in temporal lobe epilepsy : a volumetric MRI study of the hippocampus , amygdala and parahippocampal region .
12538412|The purpose of this study was : -LRB- i -RRB- to determine whether changes in the volume of the perirhinal cortex and posterior parahippocampal cortex were detectable by MRI ; and -LRB- ii -RRB- to study the distribution and degree of atrophy in mesial temporal structures including the hippocampal head , body and tail , amygdala , entorhinal cortex , perirhinal cortex and posterior parahippocampal cortex .
12538412|Our MRI results confirm pathological findings of damage in the mesial temporal lobe , involving not only the hippocampus and the amygdala , but also the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices .
12544830|Whereas the expectancy of pleasant stimuli produced activation in the left dorsolateral and left medial prefrontal cortex as well as in the right cerebellum , the expectancy of unpleasant stimuli produced activation in the right inferior and right medial prefrontal cortex , the right amygdala , the left anterior cingulate cortex , and bilaterally in the visual cortex .
12544830|Finally , our findings suggest that the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex may play an important role in the expectancy of unpleasant stimuli and that the input of this negative information is modulated by these specific brain areas .
12552033|The occurrence of MTS was evaluated after a mean follow-up time of 12.3 years by MR volumetry of amygdala and hippocampal formation and qualitative analysis of mesial temporal structures .
12552033|The mean total volumes of the right and left hippocampal formations and amygdala did not differ significantly between any of the three groups .
12559655|BACKGROUND : The amygdala , hippocampus , ventral , and dorsal prefrontal cortices have been demonstrated to be involved in the response to fearful facial expressions .
12562580|The amygdala was considered as a separate region of interest .
12562580|Nicotine increased normalized rCBF in the left frontal region and decreased rCBF in the left amygdala .
12564772|Histologically , there was neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex , including the first temporal gyrus , the parahippocampal gyrus , subiculum , amygdala , substantia nigra , brain stem motor nuclei , and anterior horns of the spinal cord , in addition to loss of Betz cells , obvious degeneration of the pyramidal tracts , and the presence of Bunina bodies .

12578923|stefano.meletti@neuro.unibo.it BACKGROUND : Anteromedial temporal lobe regions , particularly the amygdala , participate in the recognition of emotions from facial expressions .
12581337|Hyper-phosphorylated tau accumulated in neurones with neurofibrillary tangles and in neurones with pretangles in the substantia nigra , locus ceruleus , peri-aqueductal grey matter , reticular formation , motor nuclei of the brainstem , and thalamus , amygdala and hippocampus .
12584077|This is discussed in relation to the literature suggesting an important role for the right hemisphere in global affective processing and memory , as well as the literature indicating an important role for the amygdala in affective memory .
12591575|To optimize measurement techniques , hippocampal volumes were : -LRB- 1 -RRB- acquired with 1.4-mm slices ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- excluded with the amygdala ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- normalized for position ; and -LRB- 4 -RRB- corrected for total intracranial volume -LRB- ICV -RRB- .
12595192|Gradient compensation increased effective T -LRB- 2 -RRB- * values in left and right amygdala on average by 18.8 + / - 7.5 ms , while maintaining sensitivity in uncompensated brain areas .
12595192|In orbitofrontal cortex effective T -LRB- 2 -RRB- * values increased by 22.2 + / - 5.3 ms. A CO -LRB- 2 -RRB- challenge paradigm was used to demonstrate that this gradient compensation method significantly enhances BOLD signal changes in amygdala as compared to conventional echo-planar imaging -LRB- EPI -RRB- and uncompensated TurboPEPSI .
12595197|While inferior frontal activation predicted recall in general , our data show that in a positive encoding context , recall was predicted by activation of right anterior parahippocampal and extrastriate visual brain areas , whereas in a negative encoding context , recall was predicted by activation of the amygdala .
12600809|RESULTS : A first network of neural structures was identified within the right anterior temporal regions -LRB- amygdala , temporal pole , hippocampus , temporal neocortex -RRB- .
12600809|At the time of intense affective and compulsive changes , and by comparison with the first ictal period , a second network was identified characterized by significant functional coupling between the amygdala , the orbito-frontal structures and the frontal opercular region , while a decrease in functional coupling between these regions and the dorsolateral region and the cingulate gyrus was apparent .
12607982|T2-weighted MR image showed high signal intensity lesions in the medial temporal lobes , the amygdala , the hippocampus , the insula and the cingulate gyri bilaterally .
12611834|RESULTS : While improvement of OCD symptoms was significantly correlated with higher pretreatment glucose metabolism in the right caudate nucleus -LRB- partial r = -0.53 -RRB- , improvement of major depressive disorder symptoms was significantly correlated with lower pretreatment metabolism in the amygdala -LRB- partial r = 0.71 -RRB- and thalamus -LRB- partial r = 0.34 -RRB- and with higher pretreatment metabolism in the medial prefrontal cortex and rostral anterior cingulate gyrus -LRB- Talairach coordinates : x = 0 , y = 62 , z = 10 -RRB- -LRB- z = 2.91 -RRB- .
12611834|Elevated activity in the right caudate may be a marker of responsiveness to antiobsessional treatment , while lower right amygdala activity and higher midline prefrontal activity may be required for response of depressive symptoms to treatment .
12617864|bfaw@bpc.edu As an explicit organizing metaphor , memory aid , and conceptual framework , the prefrontal cortex may be viewed as a five-member ` Executive Committee , ' as the prefrontal-control extensions of five sub-and-posterior-cortical systems : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the ` Perceiver ' -LRB- dominant-right-hemisphere ventral-lateral prefrontal cortex -- VL/PERC-PFC -RRB- is the frontal extension of the ventral perceptual stream -LRB- the VL/PERC system -RRB- which represents the world and self in object coordinates ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the ` Verbalizer ' -LRB- dominant-left-hemisphere ventral-lateral prefrontal cortex system -- VL/VERB-PFC -RRB- is the frontal extension of the language stream -LRB- the VL/VERB system -RRB- which represents the world and self in language coordinates ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- the ` Motivator ' -LRB- ventral/medial-orbital pre-frontal cortex -- VMO-PFC -RRB- is the frontal cortical extension of a subcortical extended-amygdala stream -LRB- the VMO system -RRB- which represents the world and self in motivational/emotional coordinates ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- the ` Attender ' -LRB- dorsal-medial/anterior cingulate -- DM/AC-PFC -RRB- is the frontal cortical extension of a subcortical extended-hippocampal stream -LRB- the DM/AC system -RRB- which represents the world and self in spatiotemporal coordinates and directs attention to internal and external events ; and -LRB- 5 -RRB- the ` Coordinator ' -LRB- the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -- DL-PFC -RRB- is the frontal extension of the dorsal perceptual stream -LRB- the DL system -RRB- which represents the world and self in body - and eye-coordinates and controls willed action and working memory .
12644354|Neocortical modulation of the amygdala response to fearful stimuli .
12644354|A recent functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- study demonstrated that the engagement of the right prefrontal cortex during the cognitive evaluation of angry and fearful facial expressions is associated with an attenuation of the response of the amygdala to these same stimuli , providing evidence for a functional neural network for emotional regulation .
12644354|RESULTS : Similar to the earlier findings with facial expressions , blood oxygen level dependent fMRI revealed that whereas perceptual processing of IAPS stimuli was associated with a bilateral amygdala response , cognitive evaluation of these same stimuli was associated with attenuation of this amygdala response and a correlated increase in response of the right prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex .
12644354|CONCLUSIONS : The current results further implicate the importance of neocortical regions , including the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices , in regulating emotional responses mediated by the amygdala through conscious evaluation and appraisal .
12644355|RESULTS : Transient sadness was associated with significant loci of activation in the anterior temporal pole and the midbrain , bilaterally , as well as in the left amygdala , left insula , and right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- VLPFC -RRB- -LRB- Brodmann area -LSB- BA -RSB- 47 -RRB- .
12658110|Coregulation of ethanol discrimination by the nucleus accumbens and amygdala .
12658110|BACKGROUND : Activation of GABA -LRB- A -RRB- receptors in the amygdala or nucleus accumbens produces discriminative stimulus effects that substitute fully for those of systemically administered ethanol .
12658110|This study was conducted to determine if GABA -LRB- A -RRB- receptors in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens interactively modulate ethanol discrimination .
12658110|The rats were then surgically implanted with bilateral injection cannulae aimed at the nucleus accumbens and the amygdala .
12658110|Concurrent infusion of the GABA -LRB- A -RRB- antagonist bicuculline in the amygdala shifted the muscimol substitution curve in the nucleus accumbens 10-fold to the right .
12658110|CONCLUSIONS : These results indicate that blockade of GABA -LRB- A -RRB- receptors in the amygdala significantly reduces the potency of the GABA -LRB- A -RRB- agonist in the nucleus accumbens .
12658110|This suggests that the ethanol-like stimulus effects of GABA -LRB- A -RRB- receptor activation in the nucleus accumbens are modulated by GABA -LRB- A -RRB- receptor activity in the amygdala .
12658110|These data support the hypothesis that the addictive stimulus properties of alcohol are mediated by GABAergic transmission in a neural circuit involving the amygdala and nucleus accumbens .
12667842|RTNG was associated with significantly less intensity of sadness and significantly less activation -LRB- AV - NA -RRB- of the right insula/amygdala and left insula , relative to PSVW .
12667845|No significant rCBF changes were observed in the amygdala or other parts of the limbic system .
12694644|Both estrogen receptors and androgen receptors contribute to testosterone-induced changes in the morphology of the medial amygdala and sexual arousal in male rats .
12694644|The masculine phenotype in one component of the circuit , the posterodorsal nucleus of the medial amygdala -LRB- MePD -RRB- , depends on the level of circulating androgens in the adult .
12705323|Unilateral paramedian-sagittal brain cut extending from the level of the anterior commissure to the midlevel of the third ventricle above the amygdala affects gonadal function in male rat : a lateralized effect .
12705323|The aim of the present investigations was to study involvement of fiber systems to and from the insular cortex above the amygdala in the neural control of the hypophysio-testicular axis in male rats .
12705323|Animals were subjected to a unilateral paramedian-sagittal brain cut above the amygdala , extending from the level of the anterior commissure to the midlevel of the third ventricle and causing among others partial deafferentation of the insular cortex .
12705502|For the sample as a whole , amygdala volume correlated positively with age , and larger volumes of both the left and right amygdala were significantly associated with better performance on several cognitive tasks assessing academic skills and acquired knowledge in long-term memory .
12714175|The schizophrenic patients demonstrated a significantly decreased activation of the anterior cingulate during facial affect discrimination and of the amygdala-hippocampal complex bilaterally during facial affect labeling .
12724169|Mats.Frederikson@psyk.uu.se Whether the amygdala is involved predominantly in emotional perception or in the generation of emotional states has been debated .
12724169|We reviewed and reanalyzed data from our laboratory , indicating that subjective feelings of fear and distress are correlated with regional cerebral blood flow -LRB- rCBF -RRB- in the right but not the left amygdala during anxiety provocation in individuals with social anxiety disorder , specific phobias .
12724169|However , because studies demonstrate that treatment of social anxiety disorder with cognitive behavior therapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors results in reduced rCBF in the amygdaloid complex and prospective studies reveal that treatment-induced alterations in amygdala rCBF can predict 1 year follow-up status in social anxiety disorder data support the notion that the amygdala , at least in part , seem casually involved in generating the subjective experience of fear .
12725758|More importantly , at 3 T , activation was detected in several regions , such as the ventral aspects of the inferior frontal gyrus , orbitofrontal gyrus , and lingual gyrus , which did not show significant activation at 1.5 T. No difference in height or extent of activation was detected between the two scanners in the amygdala during affect processing .
12725758|Signal dropout in the amygdala from susceptibility artifact was greater at 3 T , with a 12 % dropout at 3 T compared with a 9 % dropout at 1.5 T .
12738003|Audition of laughing and crying leads to right amygdala activation in a low-noise fMRI setting .
12738003|sander@ifn-magdeburg.de Adequate behavioral responses to socially relevant stimuli are often impaired after lesions of the amygdala .
12738003|Using low-noise functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- in combination with controlled sound delivery , we investigated how the amygdala , insula and auditory cortex are involved in the processing of affective non-verbal vocalizations -LRB- laughing , crying -RRB- in healthy humans .
12738003|Both conditions led to bilateral activation of the amygdala , insula and auditory cortex with a right-hemisphere advantage in the amygdala , and larger activation during laughing than crying in the auditory cortex with a slight right-hemisphere advantage for laughing , both likely due to acoustic stimulus features .
12738003|The results show that amygdala activation by emotionally meaningful sounds like laughing and crying is independent of the emotional involvement , suggesting the pattern recognition aspect of these sounds is crucial for this activation .
12742672|Differential amygdalar response to novel versus newly familiar neutral faces : a functional MRI probe developed for studying inhibited temperament .
12742672|BACKGROUND : As a prelude to future studies of subjects with different temperaments , we sought to develop a probe to measure differential amygdalar responses to novel versus familiar stimuli .
12742672|Prior neuroimaging studies of the amygdala in humans to date have focused principally on responses to emotional stimuli , primarily aversive , rather than to novelty per se .
12742672|RESULTS : Using this newly developed paradigm , we found greater fMRI blood oxygenation level dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- signal response within the right amygdala to novel versus familiar faces -- all with neutral expression .
12742672|Furthermore , although a new facial identity was always presented in the novel condition , signal in the amygdala declined over time as it did for the familiar condition .
12742672|CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that at least one primary function of the amygdala is to detect and process unexpected or unfamiliar events that have potential biological import , of which stimuli symbolic of fear or threat are but one possible example .
12774833|Positive correlations were found between cAMP levels in symmetrical parts of the frontal cortex , amygdala , and hypothalamus in animals of all study groups .
12781728|tricosmos1@yahoo.es It has been suggested that the pathophysiology of panic disorder -LRB- PD -RRB- may involve abnormalities in several brain structures , including the amygdala .
12781728|To date , however , no study has used quantitative structural neuroimaging techniques to examine amygdalar anatomy in this disorder .
12781728|Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- studies of the amygdalas , hippocampi , and temporal lobes were conducted in 12 drug-free , symptomatic PD patients -LRB- six females and six males -RRB- , and 12 case-matched healthy comparison subjects .
12781728|PD patients were found to have smaller left-sided and right-sided amygdalar volumes than controls .
12781728|These findings provide new evidence of changes in amygdalar structure in PD and warrant further anatomical and MRI brain studies of patients with this disorder .
12784931|In condition eliciting negative emotions we also detected activation of occipito-temporal regions and additionally activation of bilateral anterior insulae , right amygdala and right superior temporal gyrus .
12784931|Particularly the central circuit controlling HR in negative affect includes the amygdala , while central circuit controlling HR in positive affect includes the hypothalamus .
12784931|Activation of the amygdala in the negative condition supports the well documented engagement of this structure in processing of fear and disgust .
12791324|rlmarche@dialdata.com.br We investigated anatomic alterations and lateralization effect in the mesial temporal lobe structures -LRB- amygdala and hippocampus -RRB- in epileptic psychosis MRI volumetric measurements .
12794661|CONCLUSION : The decrease in the rCBF in the bilateral inferior frontal regions in panic patients may be related to the amygdala activation decreasing cerebral blood flow in the frontal region and/or the hyperactivation of the locus ceruleus .
12804127|Increased amygdala : hippocampal volume ratios associated with severity of anxiety in pediatric major depression .
12804127|RESULTS : Pediatric patients with MDD had significantly larger left -LRB- 14 % -RRB- and right -LRB- 11 % -RRB- amygdala : hippocampal volume ratios than controls .
12804127|Increased left and right amygdala : hippocampal volume ratios were associated with increased severity of anxiety but not increased severity of depression or duration of illness .
12804127|CONCLUSION : These results suggest that alterations in amygdala : hippocampal volume ratios in pediatric MDD may more reflect severity of associated anxiety than depression .
12805102|Furthermore , lesions to the amygdala or insular cortices , especially on the right side , also compromise somatic state activation and decision-making .
12805102|This suggests that the VM , amygdala and insular regions are part of a neural system involved in somatic state activation and decision-making .
12805102|Twelve patients with focal , stable bilateral lesions of the VM cortex or with right unilateral lesions of the amygdala or the right insular cortices , were tested on the Emotional Quotient Inventory -LRB- EQ-i -RRB- , a standardized psychometric measure of various aspects of emotional and social intelligence .
12805107|Olfactory short-term memory and related amygdala recordings in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy .
12805107|The amygdala SEEG activity associated with odorant stimulation was examined in 18 patients .
12805107|Electrophysiological recordings collected from the amygdala demonstrated that odorant stimulation was associated with chemosensory evoked potentials -LRB- CSEPs -RRB- .
12806606|RESULTS : In response to the visceral stimulus , women showed greater activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex , right anterior cingulate cortex , and left amygdala , whereas men showed greater activation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , insula , and dorsal pons/periaqueductal gray .
12815023|Spinal neuronal responses to urinary bladder stimulation in rats with corticosterone or aldosterone onto the amygdala .
12815023|chao-qin@ouhsc.edu Elevating glucocorticoids in the amygdala produces colorectal hypersensitivity through activation of lumbosacral spinal neurons .
12815023|The aim of this study was to determine if descending modulation from the amygdala affects spinal processing of input from urinary bladder afferents .
12815023|Fischer-344 rats received cholesterol -LRB- inactive control -RRB- - , corticosterone - , or aldosterone-containing micropellets placed stereotaxically on the dorsal margin of the left and right amygdala -LRB- n = 10 for each group -RRB- .
12815023|These findings suggest that both mineralocorticoid - and glucocorticoid-mediated mechanisms in the amygdala are involved in descending modulation to lumbosacral spinal neurons receiving inputs from the urinary bladder ; and this mechanism may play a role in the activation and maintenance of primary central sensitization to noxious visceral stimuli .
12821105|Lateralized impairment of the emotional enhancement of verbal memory in patients with amygdala-hippocampus lesion .
12821105|This study investigated amygdala-hippocampus 's functional asymmetry in the emotional modulation of memory for stories .
12821105|This illustrates that the right amygdala can influence retention of complex emotional stimuli with verbal and pictorial arousing properties .
12821105|We concluded that an intact left amygdala-hippocampus is important for enhancement of memory related to emotionally arousing verbal material .
12821517|While the function of the direct ILF pathway is unclear , it appears to mediate the fast transfer of visual signals to anterior temporal regions and neuromodulatory back-projections from the amygdala to early visual areas .
12832555|The dorsal amygdalas showed a temporal gradient similar to the right hippocampus , but emotional valence and intensity were not directly associated with changes in activity .
12845380|In addition , there was a trend -LRB- P values between 0.05 and 0.10 -RRB- to smaller volumes of the right temporal lobe -LRB- 7 % , t21 = 1.99 , P = 0.06 -RRB- , right amygdala -LRB- 8 % , t21 = 1.83 , P = 0.08 -RRB- , left amygdala -LRB- 5 % , t21 = 1.78 , P = 0.09 -RRB- and left hippocampus -LRB- 9 % , t21 = 1.93 , P = 0.07 -RRB- in panic patients compared to controls .
12850252|Activation of the amygdala , increased CBF in the frontal region , or hyperactivation of the locus ceruleus seen in panic disorder may explain the decrease in the rCBF in the inferior frontal region .
12873805|RESULTS : In psychopaths , increased activation through negative contents was found right-sided in prefrontal regions and amygdala .
12873806|One previous study reported volume loss of the hippocampus and the amygdala in patients with borderline personality disorder .
12873806|The volumes of the hippocampus , amygdala , and orbitofrontal , dorsolateral prefrontal , and anterior cingulate cortex were measured in the patients using magnetic resonance imaging volumetry and compared to those obtained in the controls .
12873806|RESULTS : We found a significant reduction of hippocampal and amygdala volumes in borderline personality disorder .
12873806|Only left orbitofrontal volumes correlated significantly with amygdala volumes .
12873806|CONCLUSIONS : While volume loss of a single brain structure like the hippocampus is quite an unspecific finding in neuropsychiatry , the patterns of volume loss of the amygdala , hippocampus , and left orbitofrontal and right anterior cingulate cortex might differentiate borderline personality disorder from other neuropsychiatric conditions .
12873851|A discriminant function analysis demonstrated that the degree of atrophy of right posterior cingulate , left parietal lobe , right amygdala , and right anterior temporal lobe structures correctly classified 96 % of the patients .
12883925|PATIENTS AND METHODS : Clinicometabolic correlations between several emotional and social parameters and metabolic patterns in the frontal cortex and amygdala were investigated in 32 patients with frontal lobe pathologies .
12883925|Impulsiveness , personality disturbances and loss of emotional control were associated with decreased metabolism in the left amygdala .
12883925|In particular , they imply that the classically described symptoms of impaired behavioral control may be related to right orbitofrontal cortex hypometabolism whereas impaired regulation of emotions may result from a functional damage of the left amygdala .
12888435|We review nineteen empirical studies of mild cognitive impairment -LRB- MCI -RRB- , age-associated memory impairment -LRB- AAMI -RRB- and related classifications reporting volumetric data on the hippocampus , entorhinal cortex and amygdala .
12902310|The first of these , an ` involuntary ' or 'em otionally driven ' system , involves the amygdala , thalamic/hypo - and subthalamic areas and the dorsal/tegmental brainstem .
12906370|Lesion of the amygdala on the right and left side suppresses testosterone secretion but only left-sided intervention decreases serum luteinizing hormone level .
12906370|Both right - and left-sided injection of the neurotoxin into the amygdala resulted in a significant decrease in basal testosterone secretion in vitro of both testes and in serum testosterone concentration .
12906370|The results of the present study provide further evidence on the involvement of the amygdala in the control of testicular steroidogenesis .
12906370|Furthermore , the observations suggest functional asymmetry of the amygdala concerning the mechanism of suppressed testosterone secretion .
12916648|Burton@Fordham.edu Eighteen patients who had undergone standard anterior temporal lobectomy including removal of the amygdala and hippocampus -LRB- 9 left , LTL ; 9 right , RTL -RRB- were administered an Affective Task composed of faces depicting negative emotions , and a Neutral Task consisting of faces with different lighting and orientation conditions .
12925283|The cerebellum , pons , middle insula , and amygdala responded to intensity irrespective of valence .
12925283|They also show that amygdala activity may be driven by stimulus intensity irrespective of valence , casting doubt upon the notion that the amygdala responds preferentially to negative stimuli .
12948690|The amygdala was activated by high-intensity fearful expressions , consistent with findings from previous studies , and by low - but not high-intensity sad expressions .
1365050|PET results showed , in the resting state , a bilateral metabolic reduction in the hippocampal formation and a left hemispheric reduction in the amygdala , thalamus and in the occipital and temporoparietal junction areas of the cerebral cortex .
1446221|The present study explored the relationship between the amygdala and the hippocampus during afterdischarges .
1446221|Stimulating electrodes were placed in the amygdala and CA3 regions on the left side in urethane-anesthetized rats .
1446221|Afterdischarges were elicited by stimulus trains between 10 and 50 Hz to the amygdala .
1446221|These data demonstrate that two types of afterdischarges can be produced in the hippocampus of the anesthetized rat after amygdala stimulation .
1446221|The observations support the hypothesis that maximal dentate activation represents synchronized reverberatory activity throughout the hippocampal-parahippocampal circuit and indicate that amygdala stimulation can access this circuit in the anesthetized animal .
1449382|We used magnetic resonance imaging to examine the morphologic characteristics of the amygdala/hippocampus , prefrontal cortex , and caudate nucleus in 29 healthy volunteers matched for age , gender , and head of household socioeconomic status and 44 patients with chronic schizophrenia .
1449382|Schizophrenic patients , compared with healthy controls , had significantly smaller right and left amygdala/hippocampal complex volumes , smaller right and left prefrontal volumes , and larger left caudate volumes .
1449382|A secondary analysis revealed reductions in the right and left amygdala and the left hippocampus .
1449382|Moreover , the right white matter volume in schizophrenic patients was significantly related to right amygdala/hippocampal volume -LRB- r = .39 -RRB- , data that provide preliminary support for a hypothesis of abnormal limbic-cortical connection in schizophrenia .
14527572|The amygdala and fusiform cortex responded to high-intensity expressions of all emotions , independent of task .
14527572|The results suggest that amygdala contributes to task-independent perceptual processing of a range of emotions .
14527602|When attention was unconstrained , adolescents relative to adults showed greater activation in the anterior cingulate , bilateral orbitofrontal cortex , and right amygdala in response to the fearful relative to neutral faces .
14531157|Effects of left amygdala lesions on respiration , skin conductance , heart rate , anxiety , and activity of the right amygdala during anticipation of negative stimulus .
14531157|The present study reports the effects of lesions in the left amygdala on anxiety , respiration , skin conductance , heart rate , and electrical potentials in the right amygdala in two patients .
14531157|Trait and anticipatory-state anxiety were measured before and after left amygdala resection to control medically intractable epilepsy in the patients .
14531157|Lesions in the left amygdala resulted in decreases of trait and state anxiety , respiratory rate , and activity in the right amygdala in both patients ; one patient also showed notable decreases in skin conductance and heart rate .
14531157|The study also reports that activities in the right amygdala before the lesion were not observed after the lesion .
14531157|We suggest that the activity of the right amygdala is dominantly activated in anxiety and anxiety-related physiological responses but needs excitatory inputs from the left amygdala .
14534252|On the basis of studies in rodents , the medial preoptic area , bed nucleus of the stria terminalis , and amygdala are thought to be involved in ejaculation , but increased rCBF was not found in any of these regions .
14534252|Conversely , in the amygdala and adjacent entorhinal cortex , a decrease in activation was observed .
14557604|A specific role for the human amygdala in olfactory memory .
14557604|The specific contribution of the human amygdala to memory for odors has not been addressed , however .
14557604|The role of this region in memory for odors was assessed in patients with unilateral amygdala damage due to temporal lobectomy -LRB- n = 20 ; 11 left , 9 right -RRB- , one patient with selective bilateral amygdala damage , and in 20 age-matched normal controls .
14557604|Bilateral amygdala damage resulted in severe impairment in both odor-name matching as well as in odor-odor recognition memory .
14557604|Taken together , the data provide neuropsychological evidence that the human amygdala is essential for olfactory memory .
14565965|Rostral sites , such as the amygdala and hypothalamus , increased signal intensity as arterial pressure declined .
14568446|The piriform-amygdala area and ventral insula were activated more for unpleasant than pleasant odors .
14571840|His brain MRI showed atrophy of bilateral temporal tips and amygdala .
14571840|After Ramachandran 's explanation for Capgras ' syndrome , we hypothesized that mis-arousal of familiarity evoked by visual perception or memory was attributable to the dysfunction of amygdala , and failure of consistency-checking was caused by the dysfunction of the right frontal lobe .
1458321|In a previous study we demonstrated that the membrane-associated protein kinase C -LRB- PKC -RRB- activity in the amygdala/pyriform cortex -LRB- AM/PC -RRB- and both the right and left hippocampus -LRB- HIPP -RRB- of rats kindled from the left HIPP increased significantly 4 weeks after the occurrence of the last seizure compared with control rats .
14586163|The left amygdala and right parahippocampal gyrus were activated by unpleasant words concerning body image relative to neutral words .
14594351|RESULTS : Bilateral activations of the inferior frontal gyrus , anterior insular-periinsular area , hippocampus , amygdala , caudate nucleus and cerebellum were seen .
14597304|Temporal lobe epilepsy , a common disease , is frequently the consequence of a characteristic hippocampal pathology termed hippocampal sclerosis , which may also affect the amygdala .
14597304|The patients were subdivided into two groups according to presence or absence of additional left amygdala pathology .
14597304|The additional presence of left amygdala sclerosis resulted in reorganisation for encoding of emotional verbal material to right amygdala .
14609882|Region of interest correlations showed that only patients with schizophrenia lacked a positive correlation between left temporal pole and left anterior amygdala-hippocampal complex gray matter volumes , whereas both psychosis groups were similar in lacking normal positive correlations between left temporal pole and left anterior superior temporal gyrus gray matter volumes .
14614086|Processing of the arousal of subliminal and supraliminal emotional stimuli by the human amygdala .
14614086|glaescher@uke.uni-hamburg.de The amygdala is known to play an important role in conscious and unconscious processing of emotional and highly arousing stimuli .
14614086|Neuroanatomical evidence suggests that the amygdala participates in the control of autonomic responses , such as skin conductance responses -LRB- SCRs -RRB- , elicited by emotionally salient stimuli , but little is known regarding its functional role in such control .
14614086|We investigated this issue by showing emotional visual stimuli of varying arousal to patients with left -LRB- n = 12 -RRB- , right -LRB- n = 8 -RRB- , and bilateral -LRB- n = 3 -RRB- amygdala damage and compared their results with those from 38 normal controls .
14614086|There were two key findings : -LRB- 1 -RRB- impaired overall SCR after right amygdala damage ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- impaired correlation of SCR with the rated arousal of the stimuli after left amygdala damage .
14614086|The second finding was strengthened further by finding a positive correlation between the evoked SCR magnitude and postsurgery amygdala volume , indicating impaired autonomic responses with larger tissue damage .
14614086|Bilateral amygdala damage resulted in severe impairments on both of the above measures .
14614086|Our results provide support for the hypothesis that the left and right amygdalae subserve different functions in emotion processing : the left may decode the arousal signaled by the specific stimulus , whereas the right may provide a global level of autonomic activation triggered automatically by any arousing stimulus .
14614087|NMDA currents and receptor protein are downregulated in the amygdala during maintenance of fear memory .
14614087|The amygdala plays a critical role in fear conditioning , a model of emotional learning and cue-induced anxiety .
14614087|In the lateral amygdala , fear conditioning is associated with an enduring increase in synaptic strength mediated through AMPA receptors and with a reduction in paired-pulse facilitation , reflecting an increased probability of neurotransmitter release .
14614087|Here we show that NMDA-mediated transmission in the thalamic-to-lateral amygdala pathway is not facilitated after fear conditioning , although probability of transmitter release is enhanced .
14614087|Furthermore , the ability of nonselective and subunit-selective antagonists of NMDA receptors to block NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs is reduced in lateral amygdala neurons from fear-conditioned animals , suggesting a reduction in NMDA receptors at thalamolateral amygdala synapses .
14614087|In addition , Western blots show a reduction in phosphorylated-NR1 , NR2A , and NR2B subunit protein expression in amygdalas from fear-conditioned animals .
14614087|These data indicate that postsynaptic mechanisms are involved in synaptic plasticity in the thalamoamygdala pathway in fear conditioning and raise the possibility that : -LRB- 1 -RRB- downregulation of the NMDA receptor may protect against excitotoxicity of unchecked NMDA receptor recruitment during induction and consolidation of fear memories , -LRB- 2 -RRB- reduced NMDA current and protein may allow persistence of the `` capacity to reactivate '' amygdala pathways in NMDA receptor-dependent fear memories , or -LRB- 3 -RRB- a persistent long-term depression of NMDA transmission may occur after fear learning .
14619592|-LSB- Hippocampal formations , amygdala and anterior temporal lobes : normative volumetric measurements from MR imaging in normal adults of China -RSB- .
14619592|OBJECTIVE : To define the normal range of volumetric values of hippocampal formations -LRB- HPF -RRB- , amygdala -LRB- AM -RRB- and anterior temporal lobes -LRB- ATL -RRB- .
14619592|Volumes of the anterior temporal lobes , hippocampal formations and amygdala were obtained on T1WI .
14619592|were : 59.07 + / - 2.02 cm3 , 55.55 + / - 2.23 cm3 , 52.88 + / - 2.07 cm3 -LRB- Right -RRB- ; 57.25 + / - 2.15 cm3 , 53.23 + / - 1.72 cm3 , 51.63 + / - 2.18 cm3 -LRB- Left -RRB- ; and of amygdala in those aged 20 yr .
14619592|No significant difference in the volumes of hippocampal formations , amygdala and anterior temporal lobes was seen in the sex groups and handedness groups .
14625149|BACKGROUND : Contemporary neurobiological models suggest that the amygdala plays an important role in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders .
14625149|Several studies have examined brain function in specific phobias but did not demonstrate amygdala responses or use specific probes of the amygdala .
14625149|Subjects viewed emotionally expressive and neutral faces , and amygdala blood oxygenation level dependent responses from each group were compared .
14625149|RESULTS : There was a significant response to the fearful versus neutral faces in the amygdala across both groups but no diagnosis x condition interaction .
14625149|This suggests a restricted role for the amygdala in specific phobia .
14636318|The anticonvulsant effects of progesterone and 5alpha-dihydroprogesterone on amygdala-kindled seizures in rats .
14636318|The purpose of the present study was to investigate the anticonvulsant actions of progesterone and its primary metabolite 5alpha-dihydroprogesterone in the amygdala kindling model .
14636318|METHODS : Female Wistar rats were implanted in the right basolateral amygdala with a long-term , bipolar electrode .
14636318|CONCLUSIONS : Progesterone is anticonvulsant only at high doses when tested against amygdala kindled seizures .
14636318|At low , nonsedative doses , it was effective against both the kindled amygdala focal afterdischarge and the generalized convulsion .
14638589|METHOD : From contiguous 1.5-mm coronal magnetic resonance images , the hippocampal formation was divided into posterior and anterior segments , and the anterior hippocampal formation was separated from the amygdala .
14638589|Volumes of the posterior and anterior hippocampal formation and amygdala were computed in 46 -LRB- 31 male and 15 female -RRB- patients experiencing a first episode of schizophrenia and in 34 -LRB- 21 male and 13 female -RRB- healthy comparison subjects .
14638589|RESULTS : Patients had significantly reduced total -LRB- right plus left -RRB- anterior hippocampal formation volume relative to healthy comparison subjects but did not differ in volumes of either the posterior hippocampal formation or amygdala .
14638589|CONCLUSIONS : These findings suggest that volumetric abnormalities of the hippocampus-amygdala complex may be specific to the anterior hippocampal formation in patients experiencing a first episode of schizophrenia and are consistent with hypotheses regarding abnormal frontolimbic connectivity playing a role in the pathophysiology of the disorder .
14638879|The structures of interest are the entorhinal cortex , perirhinal cortex , parahippocampal cortex , temporopolar cortex , hippocampus , and amygdala .
14642483|hirotaka@fmsrsa.fukui-med.ac.jp The amygdala is related to recognition of faces and emotions , and functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- studies have reported that the amygdala is habituated over time with repetition of facial stimuli .
14642483|The bilateral posterior cingulate cortices showed significant increases in activity as the experimental sessions proceeded , while the activation in the right amygdala and the left medial fusiform gyrus decreased .
14659478|Both the hemispheric involvement of the human amygdala in memory for emotionally arousing events and the impairing effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on memory for emotional events , exhibit sex-related differences .
14659478|I hypothesize that both of these effects relate to a modulatory influence of each amygdala on ipsilateral hemispheric function .
14659478|Specifically , I hypothesize that the right hemisphere amygdala modulates right hemispheric processing of global/central aspects of a situation -LRB- an effect more pronounced in males -RRB- , while the left hemisphere amygdala modulates left hemispheric processing of more local/fine detail aspects of a situation -LRB- an effect more pronounced in females -RRB- .
14659479|The present study explored the role of neuroplasticity in PAG and its connection with the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- ACE -RRB- in male rodent anxiety-like response to predator stress .
14663183|Inverse amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex responses to surprised faces .
14663183|Here we show inverse fMRI activation patterns in amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- depending upon whether subjects interpreted surprised facial expressions positively or negatively .
14663183|More negative interpretations of surprised faces were associated with greater signal changes in the right ventral amygdala , while more positive interpretations were associated with greater signal changes in the ventral mPFC .
14663183|Thus , individual differences in the judgment of surprised faces are related to a systematic inverse relationship between amygdala and mPFC activity , a circuitry that the animal literature suggests is critical to the assessment of stimuli that predict potential positive vs negative outcomes .
14670575|fMRI analyses indicated significantly greater activation in the amygdala and hippocampal regions during recall to the personally significant odor than any other cue , and behavioral responses confirmed that emotional responses were greatest to the personally meaningful odor .
14670575|These findings provide convincing neurobiological evidence that the subjective experience of the emotional potency of odor-evoked memory is correlated with specific activation in the amygdala during recall and offers new insights into the affective organization of memory .
14683713|Considerable evidence from both animal and human subject research supports the hypothesis that the amygdala , when activated by emotional arousal , modulates memory storage processes in other brain regions .
14683713|By this hypothesis , changes in the functional interactions of the amygdala with other brain regions during emotional conditions should underlie , at least in part , enhanced memory for emotional material .
14683713|Here we examined the influence of the human amygdala on other brain regions under emotional and nonemotional learning conditions using structural equation modeling -LRB- SEqM -RRB- .
14683713|Enhanced activity in the right amygdala was related to enhanced memory for the emotional films .
14683713|To identify potential candidate voxels for SEqM , the functional connectivity of the maximally activated voxel within the right amygdala was investigated using partial least squares .
14683713|A subset of regions identified by this analysis showing differences functional connectivity with the amygdala between the emotional versus neutral film conditions were then submitted to SEqM , which revealed significantly increased amygdala influences on the ipsilateral parahippocampal gyrus and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during the emotional relative to the neutral film viewing condition .
14683713|These findings support the view that increased influences from the amygdala , presumably reflecting its memory-modulation function , occur during emotionally arousing learning situations .
14689142|Functional brain imaging has shown that expressions of fear and anger selectively activate the amygdala , even when the faces conveying the emotion are presented briefly and masked to prevent conscious perception -LRB- Morris et al. 1998 ; Whalen et al. 1998 -RRB- .
14711973|Combined unilateral lesions of the amygdala and orbital prefrontal cortex impair affective processing in rhesus monkeys .
14711973|The amygdala and orbital prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFo -RRB- interact as part of a system for affective processing .
14711973|To assess whether there is a hemispheric functional specialization for the processing of emotion or reward or both in nonhuman primates , rhesus monkeys -LRB- Macaca mulatta -RRB- with combined lesions of the amygdala and PFo in one hemisphere , either left or right , were compared with unoperated controls on a battery of tasks that tax affective processing , including two tasks that tax reward processing and two that assess emotional reactions .
14711973|Although the results provide no support for a hemispheric specialization of function , they yield the novel finding that unilateral lesions of the amygdala-orbitofrontal cortical circuit in monkeys are sufficient to significantly disrupt affective processing .
14729131|As a central relay-structure between amygdala , basal ganglia , mesolimbic dopaminergic areas , mediodorsal thalamus and prefrontal cortex , the accumbens nucleus seems to play a modulatory role in information flow from the amygdaloid complex to the latter areas .
14741639|Particularly , the frontal and temporal cortices and amygdala-hippocampal region have been found decreased in volume and density in magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- studies .
14741673|Functional association of the amygdala and ventral prefrontal cortex during cognitive evaluation of facial expressions primed by masked angry faces : an event-related fMRI study .
14741673|michan900@yahoo.co.jp The present study examined the functional association of the amygdala and right ventral prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- during cognitive evaluation of facial expressions .
14741673|Activity in the right amygdala was greater with subliminal presentation of the angry prime compared with subliminal presentation of a neutral face or white-blank stimuli .
14741673|Most importantly , the degree of activation of the right amygdala was negatively correlated with that of the right ventral PFC only with the anger prime .
14741673|Furthermore , activation of the amygdala was positively correlated with rate of judgment when the subjects recognized anger in the target faces .
14741673|These results are discussed in terms of the functional association between the right PFC and the amygdala and its influence on cognitive processing .
14744467|Functional connectivity of the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala in posttraumatic stress disorder .
14744467|BACKGROUND : Persistent , intrusive re-experiencing in posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- is commonly construed as a failure of cingulate inhibition -LRB- i.e. , extinction -RRB- over a hyperresponsive amygdala , based primarily on animal research of fear conditioning and the finding of cingulate hypoperfusion in PTSD .
14744467|Networks supporting autonomic and emotional control and preparatory motor action -LRB- amygdala , anterior cingulate , subcallosal gyrus , and premotor cortex -RRB- differed between the two groups and became progressively disparate with successive presentations of the traumatic script .
14744467|Patterns of effective connectivity demonstrated the predominance of direct influences of the amygdala on visual cortex , subcallosal gyrus , and anterior cingulate in PTSD but not in control subjects .
14744467|There was little evidence for failure of inhibition of cingulate or subcallosal cortex over the amygdala .
14744467|CONCLUSIONS : These patterns might represent excessive influences of the amygdala over regions involved in autonomic , and higher-order visual memory processing in PTSD .
14757593|Regional cerebral blood flow in the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex during traumatic imagery in male and female Vietnam veterans with PTSD .
14757593|lisa.shin@tufts.edu CONTEXT : Theoretical neuroanatomic models of posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- and the results of previous neuroimaging studies of PTSD highlight the potential importance of the amygdala and medial prefrontal regions in this disorder .
14757593|OBJECTIVE : To examine the relationship between the amygdala and medial prefrontal regions during symptom provocation in male combat veterans -LRB- MCVs -RRB- and female nurse veterans -LRB- FNVs -RRB- with PTSD .
14757593|Only MCVs exhibited rCBF increases in the left amygdala .
14757593|However , for both subgroups with PTSD , rCBF changes in medial frontal gyrus were inversely correlated with rCBF changes in the left amygdala and the right amygdala/periamygdaloid cortex .
14757593|Furthermore , in the traumatic condition , for both subgroups with PTSD , symptom severity was positively related to rCBF in the right amygdala and negatively related to rCBF in medial frontal gyrus .
14757593|CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest a reciprocal relationship between medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala function in PTSD and opposing associations between activity in these regions and symptom severity consistent with current functional neuroanatomic models of this disorder .
14766652|Damage to the right hippocampal-amygdala formation during early infancy and recognition of fearful faces : neuropsychological and fMRI evidence in subjects with temporal lobe epilepsy .
1486463|The basal forebrain is thought to contribute to memory function by providing cholinergic innervation to critical memory structures such as the hippocampus and amygdala .
14970831|szeszko@lij.edu The amygdala is believed to be highly relevant to the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder -LRB- OCD -RRB- given its prominent role in fear conditioning and because it is an important target of the serotonin reuptake inhibitors -LRB- SRIs -RRB- , the pharmacotherapy of choice for OCD .
14970831|In the present study , we measured in vivo volumetric changes in the amygdala in pediatric patients with OCD following 16 weeks of monotherapy with the selective SRI , paroxetine hydrochloride .
14970831|Patients demonstrated significant asymmetry of the amygdala -LRB- L > R -RRB- prior to pharmacologic intervention in contrast to healthy comparison subjects who showed no asymmetry at the time of their baseline scan .
14970831|Mixed model analyses using age and total brain volume as time varying covariates indicated that left amygdala volume decreased significantly in patients following treatment .
14970831|The reduction in left amygdala volume in patients correlated significantly with higher paroxetine dosage at the time of the follow-up scan and total cumulative paroxetine exposure between the scans .
14970831|No significant changes in either right or left amygdala volume were evident among healthy comparison subjects from the baseline to the follow-up scan .
14970831|These preliminary findings suggest that abnormal asymmetry of the amygdala may play a role in the pathogenesis of OCD and that paroxetine treatment may be associated with a reduction in amygdala volume .
14979778|Contextual fear conditioning is associated with lateralized expression of the immediate early gene c-fos in the central and basolateral amygdalar nuclei .
14979778|An increased number of Fos-immunoreactive neurons was found in the lateral part of the central nucleus and in the anterior basolateral and lateral amygdalar nuclei in the brains of the conditioned-fear group compared with controls .
14979779|Amygdalar lateralization in fear conditioning : evidence for greater involvement of the right amygdala .
14979779|The relative contribution of left and right amygdalae in the acquisition and retention of fear conditioning was investigated in rats .
14979779|Pretraining bilateral electrolytic lesions blocked the acquisition of conditioned fear to tone and context , whereas unilateral lesions induced partial impairments with no left-right amygdala differences .
14979779|Although no left-right difference was observed to tone , the right amygdala lesions generated greater deficits in contextual fear than the left amygdala lesions .
14979779|These results indicate that fear conditioning is partially disrupted with unilateral amygdalar lesions , but that the right amygdala has greater involvement than the left amygdala when conditioning occurs under a normal brain state .
14985419|In direct comparison , adolescents evidenced less recruitment of the right VS and right-extended amygdala while anticipating responding for gains -LRB- in contrast with anticipation of nongains -RRB- compared with young adults .
15004563|Men and women differ in amygdala response to visual sexual stimuli .
15004563|Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- to show that the amygdala and hypothalamus are more strongly activated in men than in women when viewing identical sexual stimuli .
15004563|Sex differences were specific to the sexual nature of the stimuli , were restricted primarily to limbic regions , and were larger in the left amygdala than the right amygdala .
15004563|Our findings indicate that the amygdala mediates sex differences in responsiveness to appetitive and biologically salient stimuli ; the human amygdala may also mediate the reportedly greater role of visual stimuli in male sexual behavior , paralleling prior animal findings .
15007124|METHODS : Volumetric measurements of the frontal , anterior temporal , ventromedial frontal cortical -LRB- VMFC -RRB- , and amygdala regions were made in 51 patients with FTD and 20 normal control subjects , as well as 22 patients with Alzheimer disease -LRB- AD -RRB- who were used as dementia controls .
15007124|FvFTD was associated with greater frontal atrophy and tvFTD was associated with more temporal and amygdala atrophy compared with AD , but both groups showed significant atrophy in the VMFC compared with AD , which was not associated with VMFC atrophy .
15013824|Glial reduction in amygdala in major depressive disorder is due to oligodendrocytes .
15013824|BACKGROUND : A previous study reported reductions in glial density and glia/neuron ratio in the amygdala of individuals with major depressive disorder -LRB- MDD -RRB- , without a change in neuronal density .
15013824|RESULTS : The density of total glia and oligodendrocytes in the amygdala was significantly lower in MDD than in control subjects , but not significantly lower in BD compared with control subjects .
15013824|CONCLUSIONS : The glial cell reduction previously found in the amygdala in MDD is primarily due to oligodendrocytes .
15013829|In the subgroup with additional PTSD , we observed right more than left activation of anterior temporal lobes , mesiotemporal areas , amygdala , posterior cingulate gyrus , occipital areas , and cerebellum .
15026504|Emotional memory and perception in temporal lobectomy patients with amygdala damage .
15026504|BACKGROUND : The human amygdala is implicated in the formation of emotional memories and the perception of emotional stimuli -- particularly fear -- across various modalities .
15026504|Structural magnetic resonance imaging showed that three of them had atrophy of their remaining amygdala .
15026504|Patients with bilateral amygdala damage had greater impairment , particularly on the narrative test of emotional memory , one showing superior fear recognition but absent memory enhancement .
15026504|CONCLUSIONS : Bilateral amygdala damage is particularly disruptive of emotional memory processes in comparison with unilateral temporal lobectomy .
15026516|Religiosity is associated with hippocampal but not amygdala volumes in patients with refractory epilepsy .
15026516|There were no other differences in amygdala or hippocampal volumes between these groups , or between high and low scorers on the writing and sexuality sub-scales .
15027419|The aim was to examine amygdala activation to fear .
15027419|Those who reported increased fear showed right amygdala activation during the threat condition and left amygdala activation in the safe condition .
15030492|METHODS : Under pentobarbital anesthesia , mice were fixed to a stereotaxic apparatus , and bipolar electrodes were implanted into the right amygdala .
15030492|A bipolar electroencephalogram was recorded ; bipolar stimulation of the amygdala was applied every day with a constant-current stimulator and continued until a generalized convulsion was obtained .
15038008|In relation to AIR , both FAM and uFAM activated amygdala , piriform cortex , and parts of anterior cingulate cortex .
15044074|Tonic and phasic alteration in amygdala 5-HT , glutamate and GABA transmission after prefrontal cortex damage in rats .
15044074|gorey@ing.ula.ve The relationship between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala during the presentation of an unconditioned fear stimulus was assessed .
15044074|Five weeks later , the behavior as well as the neurochemical changes in the amygdala was evaluated before and after a brief cat presentation .
15044074|In the right basolateral amygdala , basal concentrations of 5-HT , 5-HIAA , glutamate and serine were elevated but basal level of GABA was diminished in lesioned animals relative to controls .
15044074|Phasic changes in glutamate were not detected either in lesioned or shams but the difference in amygdala glutamate between lesioned and shams persisted after cat presentation .
15044074|These data show that increased serotonin and glutamate tone and decreased gabaergic tone in the amygdala correlate to elevated fear and anxiety after prefrontal cortex ibotenic acid lesion .
15044074|The lesion also seems to produce a failure of adaptive changes in neurotransmitter systems revealing lost of control of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex over the amygdala in frightening situations .
15054061|The posterior orbital gyri bilaterally , the left amygdala , hippocampal formation and the left pregenual paracingulate area -LRB- PPA -RRB- were activated more strongly during dichotic target detection than during correct rejection of target presence .
15054061|The left PPA , amygdala and hippocampal formation responded differently to left and right ear target detection , suggesting their involvement in the right ear advantage observed in this task .
15057515|Therefore the DA fibre densities were quantified in the dorsolateral and ventrolateral entorhinal cortex -LRB- EC -RRB- , the ventral subiculum -LRB- SUB -RRB- and in three amygdala nuclei - the basolateral -LRB- BLA -RRB- , the lateral -LRB- LA -RRB- and the central -LRB- CA -RRB- nucleus .
15072680|Impaired judgments of sadness but not happiness following bilateral amygdala damage .
15072680|radolphs@hss.caltech.edu Although the amygdala 's role in processing facial expressions of fear has been well established , its role in the processing of other emotions is unclear .
15072680|In particular , evidence for the amygdala 's involvement in processing expressions of happiness and sadness remains controversial .
15072680|Five morphs each of sadness and happiness , as well as neutral faces , were shown to 27 subjects with unilateral amygdala damage and 5 with complete bilateral amygdala damage , whose data were compared to those from 12 brain damaged and 26 normal controls .
15072680|Subjects with unilateral amygdala damage performed very comparably to controls .
15072680|By contrast , subjects with bilateral amygdala damage showed a specific impairment in rating sad faces , but performed normally in rating happy faces .
15072680|Furthermore , subjects with right unilateral amygdala damage performed somewhat worse than subjects with left unilateral amygdala damage .
15072680|The findings suggest that the amygdala 's role in processing of emotional facial expressions encompasses multiple negatively valenced emotions , including fear and sadness .
15094258|Item 5 was negatively correlated with the left amygdala .
15095176|Volumes of the whole brain , CSF-spaces , amygdala-hippocampus complex , frontal lobes , temporal lobes , and parietal lobes were measured using a standardized protocol .
15095176|In particular , volumes of the right amygdala-hippocampus complex were correlated with declarative memory performance in the non-verbal visual domain .
15096311|Clinical and experimental studies suggest that cortical and subcortical structures such as the insular cortex and amygdala play a pathogenic role .
15108302|Structures of interest comprised temporopolar , entorhinal , perirhinal , parahippocampal cortices , hippocampus , and the amygdala .
15110029|Dissociable amygdala and orbitofrontal responses during reversal fear conditioning .
15110029|Here we describe dissociable neural responses in amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex during acquisition and reversal of discriminatory fear conditioning .
15110029|During acquisition , increased responses in bilateral amygdala were elicited by a face stimulus -LRB- A = CS + -RRB- predictive of an aversive noise compared to another nonpredictive face -LRB- B = CS - -RRB- .
15110029|With subsequent reversal of the conditioning contingency , face B -LRB- new CS + -RRB- elicited enhanced responses in right orbitofrontal cortex , while face A -LRB- old CS + -RRB- continued to evoke increased responses in right ventral amygdala .
15110029|Thus , while orbitofrontal cortex exhibited rapid reversal of acquired fear responses , ventral amygdala showed a persistent , nonreversing `` memory '' for previous fear-related stimulus associations .

15111672|The 5-HT1A receptor binding potential was calculated for hippocampus , amygdala , orbitofrontal , insular , lateral temporal , and anterior cingulate cortex , in raphe nuclei , and in two regions presumably uninvolved in the epileptogenic process -LRB- parietal , and dorsolateral frontal neocortex -RRB- .
15111672|RESULTS : The binding potential was reduced in the epileptogenic hippocampus -LRB- p = 0.0001 -RRB- and amygdala -LRB- p = 0.0001 -RRB- in all patients , including the six with normal -LSB- 18F -RSB- FDG PET and MRI .
15113270|The modulation of the ASR by fear depends critically on the amygdala .
15113270|The authors investigated ASR modulation to fearful , disgusting , pleasant , and neutral stimuli in 12 patients with unilateral damage to the anteromedial temporal lobe including the amygdala -LRB- 6 left , 6 right -RRB- , 1 patient with bilateral temporal lobe damage including the amygdala , and 12 comparison participants .
15119911|Hippocampal and amygdala changes in patients with major depressive disorder and healthy controls during a 1-year follow-up .
15119911|METHOD : Thirty patients with DSM-IV major depressive disorder as well as 30 healthy control subjects matched for age , gender , and handedness were examined at admission to the hospital and 1 year later using a documentation of the medical history and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- for the presence of depression and to determine changes in hippocampal as well as amygdala volumes .
15119911|RESULTS : No significant hippocampal and amygdala volume changes were observed in patients or controls between baseline and 1-year follow-up investigations .
15124712|In the present study , we determined the involvement of CRH and IL-1 in the alteration of sleep-wake activities in rats when amygdala kindling was given either at the beginning of the light period -LRB- light-onset kindling -RRB- or at the beginning of the dark period -LRB- dark-onset kindling -RRB- .
15124712|Kindling stimuli delivered via a bipolar electrode placing in the right central nucleus of the amygdala .
15124712|CONCLUSION : These observations argue that amygdala-kindling-induced sleep-wake alterations are modulated by central increases in CRH or IL-1 .
15130592|The left amygdala was highly activated in response to dynamic facial expressions relative to both control stimuli in the case of fearful expressions , but not in the case of happy expressions .
15132428|Collapsing across High and Low Recall conditions , -LRB- 1 -RRB- the PTSD group had higher rCBF in bilateral hippocampus and left amygdala than the Control group , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- within the PTSD group , symptom severity was positively associated with rCBF in hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus .
15133908|MATERIAL AND METHOD : We performed lesion of the insular cortex , the amygdala , interrupted part of nerve fibers to and from the insular cortex , and cut the major commissural pathway of the brain the corpus callosum in adult male rats and studied the effect of the interventions on testicular steroidogenesis , serum testosterone and gonadotrop hormone concentrations .
15133908|Interruption of nerve fibers above the amygdala by a paramedian sagittal knife cut on the right or on the left side resulted in opposite effect on testicular steroidogenesis : right-sided intervention increased while left-sided one reduced testosterone secretion .
15133908|Both right - and left-sided lesion of the amygdala induced a significant decrease in basal testosterone secretion in vitro of both testes and in serum testosterone level .
15135882|In particular , volumes of the right amygdala-hippocampus complex correlated with declarative memory performance , whereas volumes of the left temporo-parietal regions correlated with performance in naming and praxia .
15144423|METHODS : A right sensorimotor cortex freeze lesion was induced in postnatal day 1 -LRB- P1 -RRB- rat pups , and HSs were provoked at P10 under continuous monitoring of core temperature ; EEGs were recorded from the right amygdala during and after hyperthermia .
15145315|Magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- revealed a space-occupying lesion over the right temporal lobe near the amygdala .
15145620|Lateralization of amygdala activation : a systematic review of functional neuroimaging studies .
15145620|d.baas@fss.uu.nl Functional neuroimaging studies of emotion processing consistently report amygdala activation .
15145620|Most of these studies observed lateralized amygdala activity , indicative of a clear hemisphere-specific processing difference between the left and right amygdalae .
15145620|Because individual studies use varying paradigms and are limited by statistical power and sensitivity , it has remained unclear whether the left or the right amygdala is more consistently involved in emotional processing .
15145620|By combining results across 54 fMRI and PET studies in a metaanalysis , we sought to establish if a common pattern of lateralized amygdala activation exists .
15145620|Our findings indicate that across studies , the left amygdala is more often activated than the right amygdala , suggesting different roles for the left and right amygdalae in emotional processing .
15145620|Further analysis showed that this predominant left amygdala activation is not significantly related to stimulus type , task instructions , differential habituation rates of the left and right amygdalae or elaborate processing .
15155523|The impact of early and late damage to the human amygdala on ` theory of mind ' reasoning .
15155523|We examined the effects of lesions of the amygdala which arise at different stages of development on this key aspect of social cognition .
15155523|Tests of ToM , executive and general neuropsychological function were given to subjects with lesions of the amygdala arising congenitally or in early childhood -LRB- ` early damage ' , n = 15 -RRB- , subjects who acquired damage to the amygdala in adulthood -LRB- ` late damage ' n = 11 -RRB- and matched clinical -LRB- n = 14 -RRB- and healthy comparison groups -LRB- n = 38 -RRB- .
15155523|Subjects with early damage to the amygdala , particularly if the lesion was associated with childhood onset of seizures , were impaired relative to all other groups on more advanced tests of ToM reasoning , such as detecting tactless or ironic comments or interpreting non-literal utterances .
15155523|These deficits held for subjects with either left or right early amygdala damage and encompassed the understanding of both the beliefs and emotional states of others .
15155523|In contrast , subjects who acquired damage to the amygdala in adulthood -LRB- usually as part of an anterior temporal lobectomy -RRB- were not impaired in ToM reasoning relative to both clinical and healthy controls , supporting the position that the amygdala is not part of the neural circuitry mediating the ` on-line ' performance of ToM reasoning .
15155523|We discuss the results in the light of recent theories which link early developmental insults to the amygdala with the ToM impairments which are thought to be a core neurocognitive deficit found in disorders such as autism .
15155523|We conclude that the amygdala may play an important role in the neural systems supporting the normal development of ToM reasoning .
15158011|Serotonin transporter polymorphism related to amygdala excitability and symptom severity in patients with social phobia .
15158011|tomas.furmark@psyk.uu.se A functional polymorphism in the promoter region of the human serotonin transporter -LRB- 5-HTT -RRB- gene has been related to negative affect and amygdala activity .
15158011|We studied amygdala activation during social anxiety provocation in relation to affective ratings and 5-HTT genetic variation .
15158011|-LSB- H2 -LRB- 15 -RRB- O -RSB- positron emission tomography was used to estimate amygdala blood flow during private and public speaking -LRB- baseline and anxiety conditions -RRB- in 17 patients with social phobia .
15158011|Individuals with one or two copies of the short allele exhibited significantly increased levels of anxiety-related traits , state anxiety , and enhanced right amygdala responding to anxiety provocation , compared with subjects homozygous for the long allele .
15158011|Thus , 5-HTT genetic variation was associated with symptom severity and amygdala excitability in social phobia .
15165344|This procedure removed approximately 50 % of the anterior portion of the hippocampus , as well as the amygdala and lateral temporal lobe .
15169855|Sex-related hemispheric lateralization of amygdala function in emotionally influenced memory : an FMRI investigation .
15169855|lfcahill@uci.edi The amygdala appears necessary for enhanced long-term memory associated with emotionally arousing events .
15169855|Recent brain imaging investigations support this view and indicate a sex-related hemispheric lateralization exists in the amygdala relationship to memory for emotional material .
15169855|The results demonstrate a significantly stronger relationship in men than in women between activity of the right hemisphere amygdala and memory for those slides judged as arousing , and a significantly stronger relationship in women than in men between activity of the left hemisphere amygdala and memory for arousing slides .
15169855|An ANOVA confirmed a significant interaction between sex and hemisphere regarding amygdala function in memory .
15169855|These results provide the strongest evidence to date of a sex-related hemispheric lateralization of amygdala function in memory for emotional material .
15172104|Prolongation of T -LRB- 2 -RRB- relaxation times of hippocampus and amygdala in Alzheimer 's disease .
15172104|The aim of our study was to examine whether there was a prolonged T -LRB- 2 -RRB- relaxation time -LRB- T -LRB- 2 -RRB- -RRB- in hippocampus and amygdala in AD , and whether in AD , the relaxometry data correlated to cognitive performance .
15172104|In a 1.5 T MR scanner , T -LRB- 2 -RRB- of hippocampus and amygdala was measured from 51 patients with AD , 23 subjects with vascular dementia -LRB- VaD -RRB- and 31 healthy elderly controls .
15172104|The AD patients had longer T -LRB- 2 -RRB- in hippocampus and amygdala than VaD subjects and healthy elderly controls .
15178947|Based on previous research , we hypothesized that agreeableness would be negatively correlated with left medial orbitofrontal cortex size and positively correlated with right amygdala volume .
15178947|These patients underwent T -LRB- 1 -RRB- - weighted MRI imaging , and gray matter volumes for right and left orbitofrontal lobes and amygdalas were derived via segmentation and region of interest tracing , normalizing for total intracranial volume .
15178947|Contrary to our hypothesis , amygdala volume did not significantly predict agreeableness .
15178947|This finding partly replicates a previous study that used a different measure of social functioning , the Interpersonal Adjective Scale , to delineate a left frontal-right amygdala circuit for agreeableness .
15179796|Brain MRI demonstrated left frontal lobe -LRB- orbital cortex and dorso-lateral surface -RRB- contusions , severe atrophy in the left temporal cortex including the hippocampus and amygdala , and diffuse axonal injury in the left frontal white matter .
15183402|The left-hemisphere areas activated by both the selective processing of text and speech were as follows : the inferior prefrontal -LRB- Brodmann 's area , BA 45 , 47 -RRB- , anterior temporal -LRB- BA 38 -RRB- , posterior insular -LRB- BA 13 -RRB- , inferior -LRB- BA 20 -RRB- and middle temporal -LRB- BA 21 -RRB- , occipital -LRB- BA 18/30 -RRB- cortices , the caudate nucleus , and the amygdala .
15196652|In humans , bilateral amygdala damage is followed by impaired recognition of facial expressions of fear .
15196652|We also examined the effect of early versus later damage , comparing subjects with hippocampal-amygdalar sclerosis -LRB- MTS -RRB- and seizures occurring before five years of age to epilepsy patients with late onset seizures .
15209221|RESULTS : Emotional pictures resulted in significantly increased blood flow bilaterally in the mesial frontal lobe/anterior cingulate gyrus , dorsolateral frontal lobe , amygdala/anterior temporal regions , and cerebellum .
15219596|Despite an equal behavioral result to controls , the patients showed less activation in the components of the circuit -LRB- right amygdala , bilateral hippocampal region , medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- MPFC -RRB- , basal ganglia , thalamus , cerebellum , midbrain , and visual cortex -RRB- .
15219596|In particular , decreased activation in the right amygdala and MPFC appears to be an important finding related to dysfunctional emotional behavior in schizophrenia .
15237084|Nevertheless , patients with prominent aggressive obsessions and checking compulsions showed reduced amygdala volume in the right hemisphere .
15246114|Experiments were designed to reproduce the antiepileptic effects of low frequency stimulation -LRB- LFS -RRB- during the amygdala kindling process and to examine LFS-induced changes in receptor binding levels of different neurotransmitters in normal brain .
15246114|Male Wistar rats were stereotactically implanted in the right amygdala with a bipolar electrode .
15246114|Rats -LRB- n = 14 -RRB- received twice daily LFS -LRB- 15 min train of 1Hz , 0.1 ms at an intensity of 100 to 400 microA -RRB- immediately after amygdala kindling stimulation -LRB- 1s train of 60 Hz biphasic square waves , each 1 ms at amplitude of 200-500 microA -RRB- during 20 days .
15246114|Thereafter , normal rats -LRB- n = 7 -RRB- received amygdala LFS twice daily for 40 trials .
15246114|Autoradiography experiments revealed increased BZD receptor binding in basolateral amygdala -LRB- 20.5 % -RRB- and thalamus -LRB- 29.3 % -RRB- ipsilateral to the place of stimulation and in contralateral temporal cortex -LRB- 18 % -RRB- as well as decreased values in ipsilateral frontal cortex -LRB- 24.2 % -RRB- .
15254095|The amygdala is enlarged in children but not adolescents with autism ; the hippocampus is enlarged at all ages .
15254095|Here we report findings on the amygdala and the hippocampal formation .
15254095|Borders of the amygdala , hippocampus , and cerebrum were defined , and their volumes were measured in male children -LRB- 7.5-18 .5 years of age -RRB- in four diagnostic groups : autism with mental retardation , autism without mental retardation , Asperger syndrome , and age-matched typically developing controls .
15254095|Although there were no differences between groups in terms of total cerebral volume , children with autism -LRB- 7.5-12 .5 years of age -RRB- had larger right and left amygdala volumes than control children .
15254095|There were no differences in amygdala volume between the adolescent groups -LRB- 12.75-18 .5 years of age -RRB- .
15254095|Interestingly , the amygdala in typically developing children increases substantially in volume from 7.5 to 18.5 years of age .
15254095|Thus , the amygdala in children with autism is initially larger , but does not undergo the age-related increase observed in typically developing children .
15254095|These cross-sectional findings indicate an abnormal program of early amygdala development in autism and an abnormal pattern of hippocampal development that persists through adolescence .
15254095|The cause of amygdala and hippocampal abnormalities in autism is currently unknown .
15257156|Predominant BOLD signal change to the contrasts of infants minus neutral stimulus occurred in bilateral visual processing regions -LRB- BA 19,21,37,38 -RRB- ; to own infant minus unknown infant in right anterior temporal pole -LRB- BA 38 -RRB- , left amygdala and visual cortex -LRB- BA 19 -RRB- , and to the unknown infant minus own infant contrast in bilateral orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- BA 10,47 -RRB- and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- BA 8 -RRB- -LSB- corrected -RSB- These findings suggest that amygdala and temporal pole may be key sites in mediating a mother 's response to her infant and reaffirms their importance in face emotion processing and social behaviour .
15268916|The parahippocampal gyrus/amygdala was the sole site that displayed significant activation to human faces , but not to dog faces or houses .
15276825|bhettrs@umdnj.edu The present study sought to determine the effects of kindled seizures generated from the left and right amygdala upon weight gain in rat .
15276825|Seventy-five female Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with electrodes in basal amygdala of the left and right hemispheres .
15276825|An electrode was implanted into the basal amygdala of the control rats but no stimulation was applied .
15276825|The results demonstrated that kindling from either the left or right amygdala induced significant increases in weight gain relative to the control rats .
15276825|However , kindling from the left basal amygdala induced increases in body weight that were four times greater than control rats and two times greater than the rats kindled from the right side of the basal amygdala .
15276825|Likewise , serum leptin levels , which were highly correlated with weight gain , also showed significantly greater increases in left amygdaloid kindled rats relative to rats kindled from the right amygdala and control rats .
15280440|Long-term ethanol self-administration by cynomolgus macaques alters the pharmacology and expression of GABAA receptors in basolateral amygdala .
15280440|We have recently demonstrated that chronic ethanol ingestion alters the functional and pharmacological properties of GABAA receptors measured in acutely isolated rat lateral/basolateral amygdala neurons , a limbic forebrain region involved with fear-learning and innate anxiety .
15280440|To understand relevance of these results in the context of primates , we have examined the effects of long-term ethanol self-administration on basolateral amygdala GABAA receptor pharmacology and expression in cynomolgus macaques -LRB- Macaca fascicularis -RRB- .
15280440|The impact of this 18-month-long exposure on GABAA receptor function was assessed in acutely isolated neurons from basolateral amygdala with whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology .
15280440|To understand the mechanism governing these adaptations , we quantified GABAA alpha subunit mRNAs in basolateral amygdala from the same animals .
15280440|We conclude that adaptations of basolateral amygdala GABAA receptors after long-term ethanol self-administration by the cynomolgus macaque are similar , but not identical , to those described in rodents after a brief forced ethanol exposure .
15298786|The amygdala was selectively activated when subjects were processing social emotions , both related to self and other .
15313519|No significant differences between groups were found for caudate , amygdala , temporal lobes , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and total brain volumes .
15319275|Normal subjects showed additional activation to familiar faces in the posterior cingulate , amygdala and medial frontal lobes , including the anterior cingulate .
15319275|This network included the amygdala and implies that this structure , involved in multiple socio-emotional functions , can be responsive in autism in the presence of stimuli that represent high reward value , such as mother 's face .
15319804|In amygdaloid kindled seizures , electrodes were implanted into the right amygdala and electroencephalogram was recorded bipolarly ; stimulation was applied bipolarly every day by a constant current stimulator and continued until a generalized convulsion was obtained .
15327714|Asymmetry of the hippocampus and amygdala in MRI volumetric measurements of normal adults .
15327714|opedraza@hp.ufl.edu Multiple studies have explored the relationship between MRI-based volumetric measurements of the hippocampus and amygdala , the degree of volumetric asymmetry of these structures , and symptom manifestation .
15327714|The present study employed meta-analytic procedures to provide a systematic analysis of the normal population parameters of hippocampal and amygdala volumetric asymmetry as well as the absolute intrahemispheric volumes of these structures in normal adults .
15327714|A literature review of studies published between 1990 and 2002 resulted in a representative sample of 82 studies -LRB- N = 3,564 participants -RRB- providing volumetric information of the hippocampus and 51 studies -LRB- N = 2,000 participants -RRB- providing volumetric information of the amygdala .
15327714|Results revealed that both the hippocampus and the amygdala are reliably asymmetrical structures in normal adults , with larger right hippocampal -LRB- D = 0.21 , p. 001 -RRB- and right amygdala -LRB- D = 0.09 , p. 01 -RRB- volumes .
15327714|These results expand on previous volumetric normative studies and may be relevant to investigators studying the clinical correlates of hippocampal and amygdala volumes .
15336519|The challenge condition was associated with activation in both right superior temporal sulcus and right amygdala , which might relate to increased social vigilance and anxiety , respectively .
15351369|Periodically , spread of this activity occurred to the amygdala , to the posterior part of the hippocampus , and less often to the temporobasal cortex .
15351623|The perception of expressive gestures elicited activity in the anterior paracingulate cortex , the amygdala and the temporal poles bilaterally and the right superior temporal sulcus .
15364037|Cross-sectional study of abnormal amygdala development in adolescents and young adults with bipolar disorder .
15364037|BACKGROUND : In vivo imaging studies in adult bipolar patients have suggested enlargement of the amygdala .
15364037|Measures of amygdala , hippocampus , temporal gray matter , temporal lobe , and intracranial volumes -LRB- ICV -RRB- were obtained .
15364037|RESULTS : There was a trend to smaller left amygdala volumes in patients -LRB- mean volumes + / - SD = 1.58 + / - .42 mL -RRB- versus control subjects -LRB- 1.83 + / - .4 mL ; F = 3.87 , df = 1,32 , p = .06 -RRB- .
15364037|Bipolar patients did not show significant differences in right or left hippocampus , temporal lobe gray matter , temporal lobe , or right amygdala volumes -LRB- analysis of covariance , age , gender , and ICV as covariates , p > .05 -RRB- compared with healthy control subjects .
15364037|Furthermore , there was a direct correlation between left amygdala volumes and age -LRB- r = .
15364037|CONCLUSIONS : The direct correlation between left amygdala volumes and age in bipolar patients , not present in healthy control subjects , may reflect abnormal developmental mechanisms in bipolar disorder .
15364039|Strong heterogeneity existed for several regions , including the third ventricle , left subgenual prefrontal cortex , bilateral amygdala and thalamus .
15381027|The present study examined amygdala and hippocampus morphology in an attempt to further understand the neural correlates of psychosocial and memory functioning in TS .
15381027|Volumetric analyses of the MRI scans included whole brain segmentation and manual delineation of the amygdala and hippocampus .
15381027|Compared to controls , participants with TS demonstrated significantly larger left amygdala gray matter volumes , irrespective of total cerebral tissue and age .
15382260|We show that there is greater activity for successful encoding of associative information than for non-associative information in the right hippocampal region , as well as in the left amygdala and right parahippocampal cortex .

15451366|Anxiolytic effects of kindling role of anatomical location of the kindling electrode in response to kindling of the right basolateral amygdala .
15451366|rademec@mun.ca Study of effects of kindling on affect has been complicated by the fact that anxiogenic , anxiolytic or no effects may be observed following kindling of the amygdala .
15451366|Factors affecting behavioral outcome include strain of rat , hemisphere kindled , amygdala nucleus kindled and location of the kindling electrodes within particular AP planes of a given nucleus .
15451366|Previous work has suggested that kindling of the right basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is predominantly anxiogenic .
15451366|Effects on sucrose consumption are consistent with previous studies showing no depressive-like effects of amygdala kindling in rodents .
15451366|It is hypothesized that the focal nature of the behavioral consequences of amygdala kindling are best understood in the context of the circuitry in which the cells stimulated are imbedded and the impact of kindling on functioning of those circuits .
15451699|They also increase mRNA expression of activity-dependent genes -LRB- c-fos and zif/268 -RRB- in brain regions specialized for processing faces -LRB- temporal and medial frontal cortices and basolateral amygdala -RRB- and for emotional control -LRB- orbitofrontal and cingulate cortex -RRB- , and reduce their expression in regions associated with stress responses -LRB- hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus -RRB- and fear -LRB- central and lateral amygdala -RRB- .
15465289|There were also significant gray matter volume reductions in the bilateral posterior STG , bilateral inferior frontal gyrus , left posterior amygdala-hippocampal complex -LRB- mostly hippocampus -RRB- , and the left insula .
1547297|We did not replicate the finding of decreased hippocampal , amygdala , or temporal lobe volume in our schizophrenic patients .
15474920|Impaired emotional learning and reduced amygdala size in schizophrenia : a 3-month follow-up .
15474920|A relationship between behavioral variables of emotional processing and structural amygdala alterations in schizophrenia has been proposed but not shown , yet .
15474920|Morphological studies of amygdala size in schizophrenia have yielded inconsistent results .
15474920|Subjects with schizophrenia showed a significant decrease -LRB- by 13 % -RRB- in total size of the amygdala compared to controls , which was more pronounced on the right side .
15474920|Volume of the right amygdala in subjects with schizophrenia and in controls was significantly related to emotional learning , indicating better learning in subjects with larger amygdala size .
15474920|It seems to be linked to size reduction of the right amygdala in schizophrenia .
1547750|Our results indicate that the dentate lesion induced the facilitation of the behavioral development of the amygdaloid kindling , whereas there was only a slight increase in the duration of afterdischarge and the spontaneous epileptiform potential of the amygdala .
1547750|We also found that on a right amygdala that had been influenced by a left dentate lesion there were few spikes , while on the left amygdala there were frequent spikes .
1547750|These results suggest that the dentate nucleus plays an important role in amygdaloid kindling as well as in the neuronal plasticity of the amygdala .
15488397|In addition to the areas identified by the analysis of the average MEG data , statistically significant activity is identified in several other areas , including a sustained increase in the right amygdala activity in response to emotional faces in schizophrenic subjects .
15488398|ochsner@psych.columbia.edu Functional neuroimaging studies examining the neural bases of the cognitive control of emotion have found increased prefrontal and decreased amygdala activation for the reduction or down-regulation of negative emotion .
15488398|Results indicated -LRB- 1a -RRB- that both up - and down-regulating negative emotion recruited prefrontal and anterior cingulate regions implicated in cognitive control , -LRB- 1b -RRB- that amygdala activation was modulated up or down in accord with the regulatory goal , and -LRB- 1c -RRB- that up-regulation uniquely recruited regions of left rostromedial PFC implicated in the retrieval of emotion knowledge , whereas down-regulation uniquely recruited regions of right lateral and orbital PFC implicated in behavioral inhibition .
15488398|These data suggest that both common and distinct neural systems support various forms of reappraisal and that which particular prefrontal systems modulate the amygdala in different ways depends on the regulatory goal and strategy employed .
15488414|The application to 34 XXY males and 62 normal male controls reveals pronounced volume reduction in the brains of XXY males , relative to the brains of normal controls , localized at the insula , temporal gyri , amygdala , hippocampus , cingulate , and occipital gyri .
15504652|The relationship between severity of subjective memory impairment and volume of the hippocampus/amygdala complex was investigated in non-demented depressed patients and it was found to correlate with decreasing volume in the right hippocampus .

15525806|Smaller clusters and defined areas of group signal differences in the midline dorsal medulla , amygdala bilaterally , right dorsal-posterior temporal cortex , and left anterior insula also emerged .
15531561|Hypoxia elicited significant -LRB- P < 0.05 -RRB- differences in magnitude and timing of responses between groups in cerebellar cortex and deep nuclei , posterior thalamic structures , limbic areas -LRB- including the insula , amygdala , ventral anterior thalamus , and right hippocampus -RRB- , dorsal and ventral midbrain , caudate , claustrum , and putamen .
15538143|RESULTS : Before treatment , GABA levels in several CNS regions were lower in patients than in normal volunteers and were the only biochemical changes found ; significantly lowered GABA levels were found in the cingulate , right and left insula , and left amygdala .
15538143|After treatment that inhibited sensory distortions , CNS GABA levels increased in the cingulate , insula , and amygdala but significantly only in the left insula and in the right and left amygdala .

15541319|This study examined the volumes of the amygdala and hippocampus in cocaine-addicted subjects and matched healthy controls and determined that the amygdala but not the hippocampus was significantly reduced in volume .
15541319|The right-left amygdala asymmetry in control subjects was absent in the cocaine addicts .
15541319|Topological analysis of amygdala isosurfaces -LRB- population averages -RRB- revealed that the isosurface of the cocaine-dependent group undercut the anterior and superior surfaces of the control group , implicating a difference in the corticomedial and basolateral nuclei .
15541319|In cocaine addicts , amygdala volume did not correlate with any measure of cocaine use .
15541319|The amygdala symmetry coefficient did correlate with baseline but not cocaine-primed craving .
15541319|These findings argue for a condition that predisposes the individual to cocaine dependence by affecting the amygdala , or a primary event early in the course of cocaine use .
15546702|Volume reduction of the amygdala in patients with schizophrenia : a magnetic resonance imaging study .
15546702|The amygdala is known to be involved in the pathology of schizophrenia .
15546702|While only a limited number of studies in schizophrenia have measured the amygdala as a single structure .
15546702|The aim of this study was to examine the hypothesis that patients with schizophrenia would show reduced volumes in the amygdala compared with normal controls .
15546702|We investigated amygdala volume in 40 patients with schizophrenia -LRB- 20 males , 20 females -RRB- and 40 age - and gender-matched normal controls using three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- .
15546702|Whole volumes of both the amygdala and the temporal lobe were measured on consecutive coronal 1-mm slices .
15546702|The amygdala volume was significantly smaller in schizophrenia patients than in controls .
15546702|Considering gender differences , male patients had significantly smaller volumes in the bilateral amygdala than male controls ; female patients had a significantly reduced right amygdala compared with female controls .
15546702|Furthermore , a significant left-smaller-than-right volumetric asymmetry of the amygdala was detected in male patients with schizophrenia .
15546702|The results may be important for understanding the role of the amygdala in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and the anatomical substrates of gender difference in the expressions of the illness .
15551188|As response to negative affect arousing visual stimulation HA in comparison to NA showed a lower activation in the right medial prefrontal cortex and in the right amygdala .
15551188|Hypothetically a fundamental factor for the emergence of alexithymic traits is an inhibiting process between affect processing -LRB- e. g. medial prefrontal cortex , anterior cingulum -RRB- and affect generating structures -LRB- e. g. amygdala -RRB- .
15558887|Hippocampus and amygdala volumes in elderly schizophrenic patients as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging .
15558887|P.Sachdev@unsw.edu.au Reduced size of the hippocampus and amygdala has been one of the more consistent morphological findings in schizophrenia , but the question of medial temporal abnormalities in elderly schizophrenia patients has been inadequately addressed .
15558887|Hippocampus and amygdala volumes were obtained by manual tracing on T1-weighted 1.5 mm thick contiguous coronal slices perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus .
15558887|Patients had smaller left hippocampal and right amygdala volumes than comparison subjects , the mean differences being 9.7 and 11.1 % , respectively , but the right amygdala volumes were not significantly different after Bonferroni correction .
15558887|The hippocampus-amygdala volumes together were smaller in the schizophrenia group bilaterally .
15558887|In a pilot analysis , the LOS subjects had non-significantly smaller hippocampus-amygdala volumes than did the early-onset schizophrenia -LRB- EOS -RRB- subjects .
15558887|For the schizophrenia group , there were significant correlations between amygdala and hippocampus volumes and some neuropsychological performance indices .
15560325|Sex-related developmental differences in the lateralized activation of the prefrontal cortex and amygdala during perception of facial affect .
15560325|Males and females differed in the asymmetry of activation of the amygdala and prefrontal cortex across the three age groups .
15560325|In contrast , amygdala activation was similar for both sexes , with bilateral activation in children , right-lateralized activation in adolescents , and bilateral activation in adults .
15563720|We demonstrate that event knowledge is organized along dissociable dimensions that are reflected in distinctive patterns of neural activation : social valence -LRB- amygdala and right orbitofrontal cortex -RRB- , experience -LRB- medial prefrontal cortex -RRB- and engagement -LRB- left orbitofrontal cortex -RRB- .
15567083|Insula is a multimodal sensory integration region that acts as a gateway between somatosensory areas and limbic structures such as amygdala .
15571433|Fear and the amygdala : manipulation of awareness generates differential cerebral responses to phobic and fear-relevant -LRB- but nonfeared -RRB- stimuli .
15571433|When the timing did not permit awareness , the amygdala responded to both phobic and fear-relevant stimuli .
15571433|With time for more elaborate processing , phobic stimuli resulted in an addition of an affective processing network to the amygdala activity , whereas no activity was found in response to fear-relevant stimuli .
15576059|Point counting and stereology were used to measure the hippocampal and amygdala volume of each subject .
15576059|There were no differences in amygdala or white matter volumes between patients and control subjects .
15580167|We did not detect changes in 18FDG uptake in the limbic region -LRB- hippocampus , parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala -RRB- .
15582118|Angiotensinase activity is asymmetrically distributed in the amygdala , hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of the rat .
15582118|We have studied the bilateral distribution of soluble -LRB- SOL -RRB- and membrane-bound -LRB- MEM -RRB- alanyl - -LRB- AlaAP -RRB- , cystinyl - -LRB- CysAP -RRB- , glutamyl - -LRB- GluAP -RRB- and aspartyl - -LRB- AspAP -RRB- AP activities in stress-related areas such as amygdala , hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex of adult male rats in resting conditions .
15582118|In the amygdala , all the activities studied showed a right predominance with a significant difference ranging from 30 % for SOL CysAP to 125 % for SOL GluAP .
15589097|Significant transport of Mn2 + was observed in olfactory structures ipsilateral to site of Mn2 + administration including the bulb , lateral olfactory tract -LRB- lo -RRB- by 12 h and in the tubercle , piriform cortex , ventral pallidum , amygdala , and in smaller structures such as the anterior commissure after 24 h post-administration .
15590458|Burton@Fordham.edu Eighteen patients who had undergone a right -LRB- 9 -RRB- or left -LRB- 9 -RRB- temporal lobectomy -LRB- RTL , LTL -RRB- including removal of the amygdala and hippocampus were evaluated .
15590458|Perhaps adding an affective dimension to the material-specific memory tasks engaged the amygdala in addition to the other structures known to be important in memory .
15592466|Discriminating emotional faces without primary visual cortices involves the right amygdala .
15592466|Functional magnetic resonance imaging showed activation of the right amygdala during the unconscious processing of emotionally expressive faces .
15597062|Hippocampal and amygdalar volumes in relation to handedness in adults aged 60-64 .
15597062|kaarin.anstey@anu.edu.au We evaluated the association between handedness and manual tracings of hippocampal and amygdalar volumes .
15597062|Hippocampal volume was not associated with handedness in men , and amygdalar volume was not associated with handedness in men or women .
15597062|There was no right-left asymmetry in hippocampal or amygdalar volumes in either gender .
15598157|Asymmetries in the hippocampus and amygdala of chimpanzees -LRB- Pan troglodytes -RRB- .
15598157|Magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure the hippocampal and amygdalar volumes of 60 chimpanzees -LRB- Pan troglodytes -RRB- .
15598157|There was no significant population-level asymmetry for the amygdala .
15598548|Anatomical MRI study of hippocampus and amygdala in patients with current and remitted major depression .
15598548|Morphometric MRI studies suggest decreased hippocampal volumes in currently depressed patients , with conflicting findings for the amygdala .
15598548|There was a trend towards smaller left amygdala volumes in all depressed patients compared with healthy controls .
15598549|Group x condition effects were found in the right amygdala and PHG .
15598549|Regression analyses demonstrated that state anxiety was correlated with activity in left amygdala , bilateral perirhinal cortex , right FG , and periaquaductal grey ; by contrast , phobic fear was only associated with right-sided hippocampal activity .
15598549|Analyses of covariance suggest a further functional segregation with state anxiety being linked to enhanced activity in amygdala , perirhinal cortex , and tegmentum , and phobic fear with enhanced right hippocampal activity , suggesting a neuroanatomical differentiation between emotional-vegetative and cognitive aspects of -LRB- phobic -RRB- fear .
15601600|BACKGROUND : To assess the amygdala response to emotional faces in obsessive-compulsive disorder -LRB- OCD -RRB- using functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- .
15601600|RESULTS : Across both groups , there was significant activation in left and right amygdala for the fearful versus neutral faces contrast .
15601600|CONCLUSIONS : Contrary to findings in other anxiety disorders , there was no observed increase in amygdala responsivity to fearful versus neutral human faces in OCD as compared with healthy control subjects .
15601600|Moreover , across all face conditions , amygdala responsivity was attenuated in OCD subjects relative to control subjects .
15601600|Therefore , the present findings are consistent with abnormal amygdala function in OCD and are of a character that may distinguish OCD from other anxiety disorders .
15607294|RESULTS : Main effects for negative-neutral affective valence included activations in the amygdala and hippocampus , ventral extrastriate visual cortex , and intraparietal sulcus bilaterally .
15607294|When correcting for anxiety and depressive symptoms , we additionally found a reduced responsiveness of the left amygdala to negative pictures in patients compared with control subjects .
15607296|irosso@hms.harvard.edu BACKGROUND : The purpose of this study was to measure amygdala and hippocampus volumes in pediatric major depressive disorder -LRB- MDD -RRB- and to address the question of neuroanatomical continuity with adult-onset depression .
15607296|Group differences in left and right amygdala and hippocampus volumes were examined using repeated measures analyses of covariance , adjusting for age , gender , and whole brain volume .
15607296|RESULTS : Depressed children had significant reductions of left and right amygdala volumes compared with healthy subjects .
15607296|No significant correlations were found between amygdala volumes and depressive symptom severity , age at onset , or illness duration .
15607296|CONCLUSIONS : Smaller amygdalas are present early in the course of pediatric depression and may predispose to the development of this disorder or perhaps more generally of childhood mood disorders .
15607296|Future research should examine the longitudinal course and functional correlates of amygdala volume abnormalities in childhood-onset depression , including their possible moderation by gender .
15633706|Activation in the right extended amygdala was obtained for fearful faces and fearful audio-visual pairs but not for fearful voices only .
15641704|Volumetric MRI analysis of the amygdala and hippocampus in subjects with major depression .
15641704|In order to explore the MRI volume of the amygdala and hippocampus in patients with major depression , quantitative MRI of the amygdala and hippocampus were studied in 22 patients with major depression and compared with 13 age-matched controls .
15641704|The patients had significant asymmetry of the amygdalar volumes -LRB- right smaller than left -RRB- .
15641704|It was concluded that the hippocampus and amygdala within limbic-cortical networks may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of major depression .
15658042|-LSB- Impulsation of hypothalamic and amygdalar neurons in bilateral derivations in the state of food motivation -RSB- .
15658042|The character of impulsation of single neurons in the lateral hypothalamic and amygdalar central nucleus of rabbits recorded in bilateral derivations during quiet wakefulness , after 24-h food deprivation , and after satiation was studied by plotting autocorrelation histograms and by counting the mean frequency of discharges .
15658042|During the transition from hunger to satiation , the character of impulsation of neurons in hypothalamus and amygdala changed in different ways : -LRB- 1 -RRB- a greater number of hypothalamic than amygdalar neurons changed their mean discharge frequency -LRB- 85 versus 56 % , respectively -RRB- ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- in hunger , the number of hypothalamic neurons with delta-frequency oscillations decreased as compared to quiet wakefulness and satiation , and in the amyglala the number of neurons with beta2-frequency oscillations increased ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- in hunger , the number of hypothalamic neurons with bursting and periodic discharges decreased and the number of amygdalar neurons with equiprobabilistic discharges increased .
15658042|During state alternation -LRB- according to the autocorrelation histograms -RRB- the strongest changes in the character of neuronal discharges took place in the left hypothalamus and left amygdala .
15658042|The maximum differences in neuronal impulsation between the left and right hypothalamus were observed in the state of hunger and between the left and right amygdala , after satiation .
15664794|A significant group interaction effect was observed in the left amygdala reflecting enhanced activity in response to contamination stimuli in OCD patients .
15664794|Sensitization effects were observed in the right amygdala in the OCD group ; these paralleled an increase in levels of distress and obsessionality as well as a decrease in dorsolateral prefrontal activity .
15664794|The findings of the present study are consistent with the hypothesis of decreased frontal-striatal control of limbic structures , specifically the amygdala , resulting in an inadequate fear response in OCD patients with contamination fear .
15668430|A functional neuroimaging study showed activation to stimulation of aversive taste in the left amygdala .
15668430|Surgical treatment entailed resection from the left medial temporal lobe that included the region of amygdala that had responded to taste .
15670680|When contrasting the familiarity with the detection conditions , activated areas were found mainly in the right piriform cortex -LRB- PC -RRB- and hippocampus , the left inferior frontal gyrus and amygdala , and bilaterally in the mid-fusiform gyrus .
15671862|Activation was evident in the posterior cingulate , supplementary motor cortex and the amygdala in Caucasians , while activation was evident in the right inferior frontal , premotor cortex and left insula and in Japanese individuals .
15673663|Catechol-O-methyltransferase val158met genotype affects processing of emotional stimuli in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex .
15673663|COMT genotype had no significant impact on brain activation by pleasant stimuli but was related to the neural response to unpleasant stimuli : reactivity to unpleasant stimuli was significantly positively correlated with the number of met158 alleles in the limbic system -LRB- left hippocampus , right amygdala , right thalamus -RRB- , connected prefrontal areas -LRB- bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex , right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -RRB- , and the visuospatial attention system -LRB- bilateral fusiform gyrus , left inferior parietal lobule -RRB- .
15677391|The amygdala mediates physiological and behavioral responses associated with fear .
15677391|In animal models , neurons in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex respond to repeated stress by showing atrophy , whereas neurons in amygdala show a growth response .
15689961|Anterior limbic structures , such as the ventral striatum and the amygdala , have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and the generation of emotional responses , although few studies to date have used emotion probes to target these areas in schizophrenia .
15689961|Patients with schizophrenia showed impaired neural responses to salient stimuli in the right ventral striatum -LRB- VS -RRB- , and they exhibited elevated tonic activity levels in the right VS and bilateral amygdala , inversely correlated with overall symptom severity .
15691520|RESULTS : Healthy but not depressed individuals demonstrated linear increases in response in bilateral fusiform gyri and right putamen to expressions of increasing happiness , while depressed individuals demonstrated linear increases in response in left putamen , left parahippocampal gyrus/amygdala , and right fusiform gyrus to expressions of increasing sadness .
15699060|In comparison , the amygdala 's role in recognition of fear in non-musical contexts has been well established .
15699060|The present study sought to fill this gap in exploring how patients with amygdala resection recognize emotional expression in music .
15699060|To this aim , we tested 16 patients with left -LRB- LTR ; n = 8 -RRB- or right -LRB- RTR ; n = 8 -RRB- medial temporal resection -LRB- including amygdala -RRB- for the relief of medically intractable seizures and 16 matched controls in an emotion recognition task involving instrumental music .
15699060|These findings suggest that the anteromedial temporal lobe -LRB- including the amygdala -RRB- plays a role in the recognition of danger in a musical context .
15707909|Representation of attitudinal knowledge : role of prefrontal cortex , amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus .
15707909|Parahippocampal regions and amygdala mediate evaluative processing .
15708493|The amygdala of patients with Parkinson 's disease is silent in response to fearful facial expressions .
15708493|In response to the fearful stimulus , dipoles were also generated from the amygdala in seven out of 10 normal subjects .
15708493|In contrast , in patients with PD , N1 was centered bilaterally in the angular gyrus and supramarginal gyrus , and there was no neuronal activity in the amygdala .
15708493|These results suggest that neither the amygdala nor the temporal visual-associated cortices are involved in responding to fearful expressions in patients with PD .
15708493|Corticostriatal connections may be variably affected by a lack of dopamine or by pathological changes in the amygdala .
15708493|Thus , somatosensory recruitment may overcome the mild cognitive emotional deficits that are present in patients with PD owing to a dysfunction of the amygdala .
15709130|MR volumetric analysis of the piriform cortex and cortical amygdala in drug-refractory temporal lobe epilepsy .
15709130|Our purpose was to develop a method to measure the combined volume of the human piriform cortex and cortical amygdala -LRB- PCA -RRB- by using MR imaging and to investigate PCA atrophy .
15709130|The PCA volumes were compared with the control values and further correlated with hippocampal , amygdala , and entorhinal cortex volumes .
15709808|They also showed abnormal activity in ventral limbic areas , including decreased activity in nucleus accumbens and increased activity in hippocampus and amygdala , a circuit involved in the integration of cognitive and affective processes .
15710312|Apparent diffusion coefficient measurements in the hippocampus and amygdala of patients with temporal lobe seizures and in healthy volunteers .
15710312|bahattinh@hotmail.com PURPOSE : The goals of this work were to measure the apparent diffusion coefficients -LRB- ADCs -RRB- for both hippocampus and amygdala of persons diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy -LRB- TLE -RRB- and unilateral hippocampus pathology on magnetic resonance imaging and to evaluate the sensitivity of diffusion-weighted -LRB- DW -RRB- images in determination of the lateralization of the epileptogenic focus .
15710312|Qualitative and quantitative ADCs for left and right hippocampus and the amygdala of the controls and the patients were determined .
15710312|The amygdala was normal in all patients except one case of hyperintense signals .
15710312|No statistical difference was detected for the amygdala -LRB- P > 0.05 -RRB- .
15718370|Response patterns differed early in the right amygdala , paralleling initial respiratory pattern deficits , and late in the right insula , concomitant with cardiac rate differences .
15718370|The findings emphasize that structures that can alter respiratory timing , such as the amygdala , and modulate sympathetic outflow , such as the right insula , are deficient in CCHS .
15721179|Co-activation of the amygdala , hippocampus and inferior frontal gyrus during autobiographical memory retrieval .
15721179|Region-of-interest analyses showed greater activation of the amygdala , hippocampus , and right inferior frontal gyrus during autobiographical retrieval relative to semantic retrieval .
15721179|A targeted correlational analysis revealed pronounced functional connectivity among the amygdala , hippocampus , and right inferior frontal gyrus during autobiographical retrieval but not during semantic retrieval .
15724143|Before L-T -LRB- 4 -RRB- treatment , the patients exhibited significantly higher activity in the right subgenual cingulate cortex , left thalamus , medial temporal lobe -LRB- right amygdala , right hippocampus -RRB- , right ventral striatum , and cerebellar vermis ; and had lower relative activity in the middle frontal gyri bilaterally .
15724143|L-T -LRB- 4 -RRB- improved mood -LRB- remission in seven patients ; partial response in three -RRB- ; and decreased relative activity in the right subgenual cingulate cortex , left thalamus , right amygdala , right hippocampus , right dorsal and ventral striatum , and cerebellar vermis .
15724143|The decrease in relative activity of the left thalamus , left amygdala , left hippocampus , and left ventral striatum was significantly correlated with reduction in depression scores .
15724459|-LSB- Evoked activity of the cat hypothalamus and amygdala under food motivation and in emotional stress -RSB- .
15724459|Amplitude-latency characteristics of auditory evoked potentials -LRB- EPs -RRB- recorded in bilateral points of the lateral hypothalamus and amygdala were studied under food motivation , in emotional stress -LRB- presentation of dogs -RRB- and tentative reactions .
15724459|In the state of hunger , as compared with safety , the latencies of P1 , N2 components of EP in hypothalamus , and P1 , N2 , N3 in amygdala were decreased and their amplitudes were changed .
15724459|During presentation of dogs , decreases of latencies of all EP components including N1 occurred in hypothalamus and amygdala , changes in hypothalamic potentials were more pronounced on the right side , whereas in the amygdala -- on the left side .
15724459|It was concluded that sensory reactivity of hypothalamus and amygdala increased in motivational-emotional states .
15741749|The disgust pictures , rated as highly repulsive , provoked activation in the occipital cortex , the left prefrontal cortex and both amygdalae .
15741749|Disgust sensitivity and trait anxiety were positively , and independently from each other , correlated with the activation of the right amygdala .
15741749|This points to the role of the amygdala as an integrative brain structure , whose activation can be modulated by different affective styles .
15753036|Event-related fMRI showed right-lateralized brain activations for fearful minus neutral left-hemifield faces in right visual areas , as well as more activity in the right than in the left amygdala .
15753036|The amygdala showed enhanced functional coupling with right-middle and anterior-fusiform areas in the context of a left-hemifield fearful face .
15753036|These data provide behavioral and fMRI evidence for right-lateralized emotional processing during bilateral stimulation involving enhanced coupling of the amygdala and right-hemispheric extrastriate cortex .
15753240|A functional magnetic resonance imaging study of amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex responses to overtly presented fearful faces in posttraumatic stress disorder .
15753240|BACKGROUND : Previous functional neuroimaging studies have demonstrated exaggerated amygdala responses and diminished medial prefrontal cortex responses during the symptomatic state in posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- .
15753240|OBJECTIVES : To determine whether these abnormalities also occur in response to overtly presented affective stimuli unrelated to trauma ; to examine the functional relationship between the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex and their relationship to PTSD symptom severity in response to these stimuli ; and to determine whether responsivity of these regions habituates normally across repeated stimulus presentations in PTSD .
15753240|RESULTS : The PTSD group exhibited exaggerated amygdala responses and diminished medial prefrontal cortex responses to fearful vs happy facial expressions .
15753240|In addition , in the PTSD group , blood oxygenation level-dependent signal changes in the amygdala were negatively correlated with signal changes in the medial prefrontal cortex , and symptom severity was negatively related to blood oxygenation level-dependent signal changes in the medial prefrontal cortex .
15753240|Finally , relative to the control group , the PTSD group tended to exhibit diminished habituation of fearful vs happy responses in the right amygdala across functional runs , although this effect did not exceed our a priori statistical threshold .
15753240|CONCLUSIONS : These results provide evidence for exaggerated amygdala responsivity , diminished medial prefrontal cortex responsivity , and a reciprocal relationship between these 2 regions during passive viewing of overtly presented affective stimuli unrelated to trauma in PTSD .
15753316|By using high-resolution positron emission tomography in rhesus monkeys undergoing social separation , we demonstrate that increased -LSB- 18F -RSB- - fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and decreased uptake in the amygdala independently predict individual differences in calling for help .
15758155|Compared with the sustained attention task , the verbal WM task reduced D2 receptor availability in the ventrolateral frontal cortex bilaterally and in the left medial temporal structures -LRB- amygdala , hippocampus -RRB- , suggesting that dopamine release in these regions might have a specific role in WM. In addition , correlation analyses indicated that increased dopamine release in the right ventrolateral frontal cortex and the left ventral anterior cingulate during the WM task was associated with faster and more stable WM performance , respectively .
15772862|Individual differences in threat sensitivity predict serotonergic modulation of amygdala response to fearful faces .
15772862|OBJECTIVES : We predicted that ATD would increase the responsiveness of the amygdala to fearful faces as a function of individual variation in threat sensitivity .
15772862|RESULTS : Consistent with previous findings , fearful faces induced significant signal change in the bilateral amygdala/hippocampus as well as the fusiform face area and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex .
15772862|Furthermore , ATD modulated amygdala/hippocampus activation in response to fearful relative to happy faces as a function of self-reported threat sensitivity -LRB- as measured with the Behavioral Inhibition Scale ; Carver CS , White TL -LRB- 1994 -RRB- Behavioral inhibition , behavioral activation , and affective responses to impending reward and punishment : the BIS/BAS scales .
15772862|CONCLUSION : The data support the hypothesis that individual variation in threat sensitivity interacts with manipulation of 5-HT function to bias the processing of amygdala-dependent threat-relevant stimuli .
15780849|Contributions of amygdala and striatal activity in emotion regulation .
15780849|The amygdala was recruited most for negative emotional context , and activity in this region was positively correlated with response time when detecting negative expressions .
15780849|We showed that recruitment of the amygdala , a region implicated in evaluating emotional significance , was associated with longer response latencies when approaching negative information , whereas recruitment of the caudate nucleus , a structure previously implicated in reward and impulse control , was most active when avoiding positive information .

15795000|radamec@mun.ca Effects of kindling of right and left basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- on plus maze anxiety was studied .
15795000|If true , anxious disposition in rodents may interact with amygdala kindling to change amygdala function differently .
15800784|RESULTS : In AD patients , VBM data indicated a significant gray matter volume density decrease in bilateral amygdala/hippocampus complex -LRB- p < 0.05 , corrected -RRB- , while FDG-PET analysis showed significant glucose metabolic reductions in the posterior cingulate gyri and the right parietal lobule , compared with those in the normal control group .
15823161|In those five subjects , the rCBF in the right amygdala and the left posterior cingulate gyrus after acquisition of fear conditioning significantly increased relative to the rCBF before conditioning .

15828421|-LSB- Correlation of unit activity of the right and left amygdala in food motivation and emotional stress -RSB- .
15828421|Correlation between activities of neurons in the right and left central nuclei of amygdala of rabbits recorded during quiet wakefulness , after 24-h food deprivation , after satiation and during emotional stress -LRB- demonstration of a dog -RRB- was studied by plotting crosscorrelation histograms .
15828421|In hungry animals , in a greater number of cases -LRB- 52 % -RRB- , the discharge of a neuron in the left amygdala was the first in a pair , and the discharge of the right neuron was delayed -LRB- peaks from 10 to 50 and from 130 to 150 ms -RRB- .
15828421|When a rabbit saw a dog , the number of common inputs to neurons increased and the leading role of the right amygdalar neurons grew -LRB- 57 % -RRB- due to an increase in inhibitory influences from the right to the left amygdala .
15828421|In most cases , the interaction between amygdalar neurons occurred at the frequencies of the delta range , predominantly , from 2 to 4 Hz .
15846031|Post-training stimulation of the basolateral amygdala improves spatial learning in rats with lesion of the fimbria-fornix .
15846031|PURPOSE : To evaluate the capacity of amygdala stimulation to improve neural plasticity in animals bearing lesions of the fimbria-fornix -LRB- FF -RRB- system .
15846031|During the same surgery some animals were implanted with an electrode in the right basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- to allow the electrical stimulation of this structure .

15851723|JenningsJR@upmc.edu OBJECTIVE : To determine whether memory performance in hypertensive subjects induces diminished parietal and prefrontal blood flow activation relative to normotensive subjects but compensatory amygdala/hippocampal activation .
15851723|Relative to all other participants , hypertensive subjects that performed relatively well on verbal memory showed an enhanced rCBF response in the right amygdala/hippocampus .
15851723|Furthermore , hypertensive , but not normotensive , subjects showed task-induced rCBF in the amygdala/hippocampal area that was significantly correlated with task-induced prefrontal rCBF .
15851728|wseeley@memory.ucsf.edu BACKGROUND : The temporal variant of frontotemporal dementia -LRB- tvFTD -RRB- features asymmetric anterior temporal/amygdala degeneration as well as ventromedial frontal , insular , and inferoposterior temporal involvement .
15856725|Volumetric measurements of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging were performed in the prefrontal area , cingulate gyrus , and precentral gyrus , and the medial temporal structures such as the amygdala , hippocampus , and parahippocampal gyrus .
15856725|RESULTS : Patients had significantly decreased volumes in the cingulate gray matter and the amygdala compared to controls .
15862214|Pathways for fear perception : modulation of amygdala activity by thalamo-cortical systems .
15862214|prithad@psych.usyd.edu.au Effective perception of fear signals is crucial for human survival and the importance of the amygdala in this process is well documented .
15862214|Animal , lesion and neuroimaging studies indicate that incoming sensory signals of fear travel from thalamus to amygdala via two neural pathways : a direct subcortical route and an indirect pathway via the sensory cortex .
15862214|Other lines of research have demonstrated prefrontal modulation of the amygdala .
15862214|However , no study to date has examined the prefrontal modulation of the thalamo-cortico-amygdala pathways in vivo .
15862214|We used psychophysiological and physiophysiological interactions to examine the functional connectivity within thalamus , amygdala and sensory -LRB- inferior occipital , fusiform -RRB- cortices , and the modulation of these networks by the anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- .
15862214|Psychophysiological interactions revealed an inverse functional connectivity between occipito-temporal visual regions and the left amygdala , but a positive connectivity between these visual region and the right amygdala , suggesting that there is a hemispheric specialization in the transfer of fear signals from sensory cortices to amygdala .
15862214|In addition , both the dorsal and ventral ACC showed an inverse interaction with the direct thalamus-amygdala pathway .
15862214|These findings suggest that thalamo-amygdala and cortical regions are involved in a dynamic interplay , with functional differentiation in both lateralized and ventral/dorsal gradients .
15862518|Examination of the regional distribution of MAO-B revealed lower -LSB- -LRB- 3 -RRB- H -RSB- lazabemide binding to MAO-B in the lateral and basal nuclei of the amygdala and higher binding in the medial nucleus .
15862523|Interaction between neuropeptide Y and alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone in amygdala regulates anxiety in rats .
15862523|Both the peptides are abundantly present in CNS , especially in the hypothalamus and amygdala .
15862523|We were interested in studying the interaction between these two peptides in the regulation of anxiety , within the framework of amygdala .
15862523|We administered agents like NPY , alpha-MSH , selective melanocortin-4 receptor -LRB- MC4-R -RRB- antagonist HS014 and NPY Y1 receptor agonist -LSB- Leu -LRB- 31 -RRB- , Pro -LRB- 34 -RRB- -RSB- - NPY , alone and in combinations , unilaterally in right amygdala of rats and measured the response using elevated plus maze test .
15862523|These results suggest that endogenous alpha-MSH and NPY containing systems may interact in the amygdala and regulate exploratory behavior in an animal model of anxiety .
15862858|Consistent with other recent work , our findings indicate that emotion can facilitate visual identification , perhaps via a modulatory influence of the amygdala on extrastriate cortex .
15869492|Recapitulating emotional context : activity of amygdala , hippocampus and fusiform cortex during recollection and familiarity .
15869492|The amygdala is thought to enhance long-term memory for emotionally arousing events by modulating memory formation and storage in the hippocampus and in neocortical areas .
15869492|Recent animal studies have raised the possibility that cooperativity between amygdala and hippocampus contributes to the retrieval of fear memories .
15869492|The functional contributions of the amygdala to the retrieval of emotional memories in humans are less well known .
15869492|At test , bilateral amygdala , hippocampus and fusiform face area -LRB- FFA -RRB- were more strongly activated during recollection than during familiarity .
15869492|These data suggest that the amygdalae and hippocampi contribute to the retrieval of emotion-laden context memories by coordinating the reactivation of stored representations in neocortical areas , such as the FFA .
15869492|However , there also was a recapitulation of emotional study context in the right amygdala during familiarity only , which might therefore be related to affective implicit memory .
15877308|The amygdala is an important target of stress and mediates physiological and behavioral responses associated with fear and strong emotions .
15877308|In long-term depressive illness , the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex undergo atrophy , whereas the amygdala is hyperactive in anxiety and mood disorders and may undergo a biphasic change in structure -- increasing in size in acute depression and shrinking on long-term depression .
15877308|In animal models of acute and chronic stress , neurons in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex respond to repeated stress by showing atrophy that leads to memory impairment , whereas neurons in amygdala show a growth response that leads to increased anxiety and aggression .
15885507|Relative to healthy participants , patients with schizophrenia were characterised by underactivity during novel stimulus processing in the right amygdala-hippocampus , within paralimbic cortex in the rostral anterior cingulate and posterior cingulate cortices and the right frontal operculum , and in association cortex at the right temporo-parietal-occipital junction , bilateral intraparietal sulcus , and bilateral dorsal frontal cortex .
15885519|Hippocampus and amygdala volumes in schizophrenia and other psychoses in the Northern Finland 1966 birth cohort .
15885519|We investigated differences in volume , shape and laterality of hippocampus and amygdala in patients with schizophrenia , all psychoses and comparison subjects within a large general birth cohort sample , and explored effects of family history of psychosis , perinatal risk and age-at-onset of illness .
15885519|Volumes of hippocampus and amygdala were measured in 56 subjects with DSM-III-R schizophrenia , 26 patients with other psychoses and 104 comparison subjects .
15885519|Right hippocampus and amygdala were significantly larger than the left in all groups .
15885519|Mean amygdala volume in schizophrenia or all psychoses did not differ from comparison subjects .
15885519|Neither perinatal risk nor age-at-onset of illness had any effect on hippocampal or amygdala volumes .
15907315|Observation of smile expressions further yielded signal increases within the posterior superior temporal sulcus -LRB- STS -RRB- , fusiform gyrus and ventral amygdala .
15908839|Reduced amygdalar gray matter volume in familial pediatric bipolar disorder .
15908839|Subjects with BD had smaller volumes in the left and right amygdala , driven by reductions in gray matter volume .
15908839|Exploratory analyses revealed that subjects with BD with past lithium or valproate exposure tended to have greater amygdalar gray matter volume than subjects with BD without such exposure .
15908839|CONCLUSIONS : Children and adolescents with early-onset BD may have reduced amygdalar volumes , consistent with other studies in this population .
15908839|Prolonged medication exposure to lithium or valproate may account for findings in adults with BD of increased amygdalar volume relative to controls .
15911167|However , IBS patients showed greater activation of the amygdala , rostroventral ACC , and dorsomedial frontal cortical regions .
15912759|Neuronal loss and astrocytosis was obvious in the cerebral cortex , prominently in the frontotemporal lobes , amygdala , caudate nucleus , putamen , pallidum , thalamus , and substantia nigra .
15921853|Severity of depressive mood was inversely correlated with rCBF in the left amygdala , lentiform nucleus , and parahippocampal gyrus , and directly correlated with rCBF in the right postero-lateral parietal cortex -LRB- p < 0.001 , uncorrected for multiple comparisons -RRB- .
15930048|Compared with the controls , the bilateral volumes of the amygdala and the hippocampus were reduced comparably in the schizotypal and schizophrenia patients .
15930048|These findings suggest that volume reductions in the amygdala and hippocampus are the common morphological substrates for the schizophrenia spectrum , which presumably represent the vulnerability .
15930508|Modulation of memory consolidation by the basolateral amygdala or nucleus accumbens shell requires concurrent dopamine receptor activation in both brain regions .
15930508|rlalumie@uci.edu Previous findings indicate that the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and the nucleus accumbens -LRB- NAc -RRB- interact in influencing memory consolidation .
15935261|Disgust-evoking scenes provoked activation in the amygdala , the insula and the orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- .
15947057|Functional dissociation of amygdala-modulated arousal and cognitive appraisal , in Turner syndrome .
15947057|dskuse@ich.ucl.ac.uk The amygdala is preferentially activated by facial expressions of fear .
15947057|Right and left amygdala are hypothesized to play distinct , but complementary , roles that influence somatic and cognitive responses to facial expressions .
15947057|Right amygdala activation is linked to autonomic arousal , and thus indirectly influences left hemisphere cognitive processing centres .
15947057|Left amygdala activation is more closely associated with cognitive processing and differentiation of facial emotions .
15947057|A double-dissociation between the functions of left and right amygdala is implied by lesion studies but supportive evidence is inconsistent , partly because patients with structural anteromedial temporal anomalies have experienced variable surgical procedures .
15947057|Arousal to -LRB- fearful-neutral -RRB- faces was associated with transiently increased skin conductance responses and bilateral amygdala activation in both groups , but X-monosomic females had proportionately greater -- and more persistent -- right amygdala activation than controls .
15947057|There was a significant correlation between the left fusiform and left medial amygdala activation only in normal females , and only in them did differential SCRs -LRB- to fearful-neutral faces -RRB- correlate positively with left fusiform responses .
15947057|Arousal and cognitive appraisal functions of the amygdala can thus be functionally dissociated .
15947057|X-monosomy selectively impairs explicit recognition of fearful faces in the presence of normal or enhanced autonomic reactivity , and is associated with a functional dissociation of activity in left amygdala and left fusiform gyrus .
15960174|Follow-up MRI on the fifth hospital day , however , revealed expansion of the lesions bilaterally to the medial temporal lobes including amygdala , hippocampus and insular cortex .
15961229|Differential amygdala habituation to neutral faces in young and elderly adults .
15961229|The amygdala is an important site of habituation in humans , but no studies to date have examined the effects of aging on amygdala habituation .
15961229|Given the amygdala 's role in evaluating the salience of a stimulus and initiating behavioral responses , the potential importance of amygdala habituation in aging may be far-reaching .
15961229|Therefore , we assessed for differences in habituation in the amygdalae of healthy young and elderly adults during repeated presentations of neutral human faces using functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- .
15961229|In addition , we evaluated the relationship between amygdala volume and habituation , to examine the effects of atrophy .
15961229|Analysis of group , condition , and hemisphere revealed a significant three-way interaction , with right greater than left habituation in the young , but left greater than right amygdala habituation in the elderly .
15961229|Volumetric and correlational analyses demonstrated that amygdala volume is associated with habituation in the right , but not left , hemisphere .
15961229|We conclude that , in healthy elderly adults , the amygdala retains its adaptive habituation response , but speculate that intrinsic changes in amygdala anatomy during aging may modulate its laterality .
15970222|jrosen@udel.edu Research has demonstrated that immediate-early genes/inducible transcriptional factors -LRB- e.g. , c-fos , egr-1 -RRB- are increased in amygdala nuclei -LRB- lateral , basal and central nuclei -RRB- known to be involved in fear conditioning , footshock stress and novelty .
15970222|While the lack of c-fos expression may indicate that predator stress does not engage the lateral and basal amygdala nuclei , it may be that c-fos in the amygdala is not responsive to predator exposure .
15970222|Five minutes of cat exposure did not increase expression of egr-1 mRNA in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala .
15978022|In contrast , attention to unpleasantness increased responses in bilateral perigenual cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices , contralateral -LRB- right -RRB- amygdala , ipsilateral -LRB- left -RRB- hypothalamus , posterior insula , M1 and frontal pole .
15993537|The fMRI data analysis of the angry versus neutral faces contrast demonstrated greater activation in younger versus older individuals in the right amygdala/hippocampus region , whereas older adults demonstrated greater activation in the right anterior-ventral insula cortex .
15993624|Fate of unattended fearful faces in the amygdala is determined by both attentional resources and cognitive modulation .
15993624|pessoa@brown.edu The evidence for amygdala processing of emotional items outside the focus of attention is mixed .
15993624|Reduced responses to unattended emotional stimuli may also reflect an active suppression of amygdala responses during difficult non-emotional tasks -LRB- cognitive modulation -RRB- .
15993624|Our findings revealed that amygdala responses were modulated by the focus of attention .
15993624|Critically , a valence effect was observed in the right amygdala during low attentional demand conditions , but not during medium or high demand conditions .
15993624|Moreover , performing a difficult non-emotional task alone was associated with signal decreases in a network of brain regions , including the amygdala .
15993624|Such robust decreases demonstrate that cognitive modulation comprises a powerful factor in determining amygdala responses .
15993624|Collectively , our findings reveal that both attentional resources and cognitive modulation govern the fate of unattended fearful faces in the amygdala .
16000636|A variant C178T in the regulatory region of the serotonin receptor gene HTR3A modulates neural activation in the human amygdala .
16000636|We found that the subjects with C/C alleles had greater activity in the amygdala and dorsal and medial prefrontal cortices than those with C/T alleles .
16000636|The genotype effect in the right amygdala and prefrontal cortex was largest during the first run of the experiment .
16012281|Treatment response was associated with significant BOLD changes : increases in prefrontal cortex activation particularly in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- DLPFC , BA 46 -RRB- and the right anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC , BA 32 -RRB- ; and in the left putamen , right anterior temporal pole -LRB- ATP -RRB- , and right amygdala .
16012281|The post hoc conjunctional analyses demonstrated that BA - subjects activated the left ACC , left insula , left ATP -LRB- BA 21 -RRB- , left ATP -LRB- BA 38 -RRB- , left amygdala , and right medial prefrontal cortex .
16043331|Decreases of rCBF in the amygdala , left hippocampus , left subgenual cingulate cortex , left and right ventral anterior cingulum , right thalamus and brain stem were observed ; the only increase of rCBF was found by SPM analysis in the middle frontal gyrus .
16046064|The patient group rated the spider pictures as being more disgust and fear evoking than the control group , and showed greater activation of the visual association cortex , the amygdalae , the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the right hippocampus .
16046064|The patients also showed greater amygdala activation during the presentation of generally disgust - and fear-inducing pictures .
16046064|This points to an elevated sensitivity to repulsive and threatening stimuli in spider phobics and implicates the amygdala as a crucial neural substrate .
16055351|Whereas the right amygdala and bilateral superior temporal sulcus responded to anger prosody irrespective of whether it was heard from a to-be-attended or to-be-ignored voice , the orbitofrontal cortex and the cuneus in medial occipital cortex showed greater activation to the same emotional stimuli when the angry voice was to-be-attended rather than to-be-ignored .
16061770|In PD , color naming panic-related words was slowed and correlated with increased activation of the right amygdala and hippocampus .
16080015|Volumes of the striato-pallidal nuclei , of the hypothalamus , thalamus , amygdala , hippocampus and basal limbic forebrain were determined in the right and left hemisphere by planimetry of 20 mum whole brain serial paraffin sections .
16081303|Distinct amygdala-autonomic arousal profiles in response to fear signals in healthy males and females .
16081303|lea@psych.usyd.edu.au The amygdala has a key role in regulating arousal and vigilance , and responds to both visual and vocal signals of fear , including facial expressions of fear .
16081303|In this study , we used functional MRI to examine sex differences in the magnitude , extent , lateralization and time course of amygdala responses to facial signals of fear , in a relatively large sample of males and females .
16081303|In males , the right amygdala and autonomic arousal attenuated over the late half of the experiment .
16081303|By contrast , females showed persistent bilateral amygdala responses , with a tendency towards greater left amygdala engagement during the late phase .
16081303|Females also showed a greater general extent of amygdala response .
16081303|We suggest that distinct evolutionary pressures might contribute to a lower threshold for vigilance to signals of danger in females , reflected in a profile of sustained amygdala-arousal interaction .
16084116|Whistling recruited a symmetrically represented neural network including primary motor and ventral premotor cortex -LRB- PMv -RRB- , SMA , cingulate gyrus , basal ganglia , primary and secondary somatosensory cortex , amygdala , thalamus and cerebellum .
16088140|A volumetric magnetic resonance imaging study of the amygdala in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer 's disease .
16088140|The amygdala is severely atrophied at post-mortem in frontotemporal lobar degeneration -LRB- FTLD -RRB- , and may contribute to the prominent behavioural changes that are early features of FTLD .
16088140|The aim of this study was to assess amygdala atrophy using MRI in the main syndromic variants of FTLD and Alzheimer 's disease -LRB- AD -RRB- .
16088140|Brain and amygdala volumes , adjusted for intracranial volume , were measured on 46 clinically diagnosed FTLD patients -LSB- 22 frontal variant FTD -LRB- FTD -RRB- , 14 semantic dementia -LRB- SD -RRB- , 10 progressive non-fluent aphasia -LRB- PNFA -RRB- -RSB- , 20 AD patients , and 17 controls .
16088140|While severe amygdala atrophy was present in both FTLD -LRB- 41 % smaller than controls on the left ; 33 % on the right -RRB- and in AD -LRB- 22 % on the left ; 19 % on the right -RRB- , the FTLD group had significantly greater amygdala atrophy -LRB- z = 3.21 , p = 0.001 left , z = 2.50 , p = 0.01 right -RRB- and left/right asymmetry -LRB- z = 2.03 , p = 0.04 -RRB- than AD .
16088140|Despite an overlap between clinical and radiological features of FTLD and AD , marked amygdala atrophy points towards a diagnosis of FTLD , with left greater than right atrophy suggestive of one of the language variants .
16102787|Role of NMDA receptors in the lateralized potentiation of amygdala afferent and efferent neural transmission produced by predator stress .
16102787|radamec@mun.ca The present study investigated the role of NMDA receptors in behavioral and neuroplastic changes in amygdala efferent -LRB- central amygdala to periaqueductal gray-ACE-PAG -RRB- and amygdala afferent -LRB- ventral angular bundle to basolateral amygdala-VAB-BLA -RRB- pathways in response to predator stress .
16105635|Application of the cold stimulus elicited aberrant responses in the anterior and posterior hypothalamus , bilateral amygdala , hippocampus , cerebellar cortex , insular cortex , mid/posterior cingulate cortex , right ventral frontal cortex , and temporal and frontal cortices .
16122944|Empathy , on the other hand , was associated with enhanced activations of paracingulate , anterior and posterior cingulate and amygdala .
16139812|RESULTS : Phobics showed greater responses to spiders versus mushrooms in the left amygdala , left insula , left anterior cingulate gyrus -LRB- ACC -RRB- , and left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- DMPFC -RRB- during the identification task and in the left and right amygdala during the distraction task .
16139812|While the amygdala , especially the right amygdala , seems to be crucially involved in automatic stimuli processing , activation of areas such as the insula , ACC and DMPFC is rather associated with direct threat evaluation and requires sufficient attentional resources .
16140166|A network of face-responsive regions was identified that included the inferior occipital gyrus , fusiform gyrus , superior temporal sulcus , hippocampus , amygdala , inferior frontal gyrus , and orbitofrontal cortex .
16140346|ASD participants also failed to show modulation of left amygdala activity during imitation that was evident in the controls .
16143545|Neutral faces activate the amygdala during identity matching .
16143545|Although the amygdala has been described as a `` fear module '' , a growing body of work suggests that it is a more general `` relevance detector . ''
16143545|A well-established face matching task has been shown to robustly activate the amygdala and has been used to investigate the influence of age , drugs , and genetics on the amygdala .
16143545|The left and right amygdalae responded to both the emotion and the identity matching condition , and the only selective response to emotion matching was at the left inferior prefrontal sulcus .
16143545|The left amygdalar response habituated to emotion matching but not to identity matching .
16143545|We concluded that the amygdalar response to face matching is driven at least in part by relevance detection , independent of emotion processing , although there appears to be additional emotion-specific processing at the left amygdala .
16148238|Finally , patterns of covariance are remarkably consistent between males and females , with the exception of the left amygdala , which is positively associated with the left and right anterior inferior temporal cortex in males and with the right angular gyrus in females .
16150800|Conversely , using the identical statistical paradigm , bilateral anterior insular cortices , the right anterior cingulate , orbitofrontal cortex , amygdala , midbrain and mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus showed decreased neural activation .
16150800|These data corroborate previous investigations highlighting the involved roles of the insula , anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala in central autonomic cardiovascular control .
16154457|Aside from some changes to his occipital lobe and bilateral shrinkage of the amygdala , the rest of his brain appears normal on recent quantitative MRI scans .
16164766|Three temporal lobe structures were manually segmented : hippocampus , amygdala , and parahippocampal gyrus .
16165102|RESULTS : Comparison of the brain activation upon performing the fat-image task versus real-image task showed significant activation of the bilateral prefrontal cortex and left parahippocampal area including the amygdala in the women , and significant activation of the right occipital lobe including the primary and secondary visual cortices in the men .
16181793|Brain areas jointly activated by the anticipation of and exposure to aversive pictures included the dorsal amygdala , anterior insula , dorsal anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- , and right posterior orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- .
16197694|Differential effects of lesions of the amygdala and prefrontal cortex on recognizing facial expressions of complex emotions .
16197694|Of the temporal group , 18 had unilateral focal lesions of the amygdala and of the frontal group , 14 patients had unilateral lesions of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex-two regions held to be pivotal in mediating social cognitive skills .
16197694|Damage to either the left or right amygdala was associated with impairment in the recognition of both social and cognitive expressions , despite an intact ability to extract information relating to invariant physical attributes .
16197694|The results also suggest that the amygdala has a role in processing a wide range of emotional expressions .
16204201|An interaction between emotional encoding context and accuracy of source memory revealed that successful retrieval of emotional context was associated with activity in left amygdala , and a left frontotemporal network including anterior insula , prefrontal cortex and cingulate .
16204201|In contrast , when contextual retrieval was unsuccessful , items encoded in emotional contexts elicited enhanced activity in right amygdala and a right-lateralized network that included extrastriate visual areas .
16204201|These findings indicate distinct effects of emotion on successful and unsuccessful retrieval of source information , including lateralization of amygdala responses .
16204205|Memory enhancement induced by post-training intrabasolateral amygdala infusions of beta-adrenergic or muscarinic agonists requires activation of dopamine receptors : Involvement of right , but not left , basolateral amygdala .
16204205|lalumie@musc.edu Previous findings indicate that the noradrenergic , dopaminergic , and cholinergic innervations of the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- modulate memory consolidation .
16216534|Trauma modulates amygdala and medial prefrontal responses to consciously attended fear .
16216534|lea@psych.usyd.edu.au Effective fear processing relies on the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- MPFC -RRB- .
16216534|Post-traumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- has been associated with excessive amygdala and a lack of MPFC activity in response to nonconscious facial signals of fear , but responses to consciously processed facial fear stimuli have not been examined .
16216534|We used functional MRI to elucidate the effect of trauma reactions on amygdala-MPFC function during an overt fear perception task .
16216534|We used random effects analyses in SPM2 to examine within - and between-group differences in the MPFC and amygdala search regions of interest .
16216534|Time series data were used to examine amygdala-MPFC associations and changes across the first -LRB- Early -RRB- versus second -LRB- Late -RRB- phases of the experiment .
16216534|PTSD subjects also showed a small but significant enhancement in left amygdala activity , most apparent during the Late phase , but reduction in Early right amygdala response .
16216534|Over the time course , trauma was related to a distinct pattern of ACC and amygdala connections .
16216534|The findings suggest that major life trauma may disrupt the normal pattern of medial prefrontal and amygdala regulation .
16249100|The left amygdala and the right anterior temporal pole were activated during the Attending task , whereas activation was observed in the left lateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- LPFC -RRB- , including the adjacent medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- MPFC -RRB- , and medial orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- MOFC -RRB- during the Suppression task .
16249100|In the Attending task , activation in the amygdala and MOFC positively correlated with magnitudes of the SCR and ACTH responses .
16255007|Compared to a passive resting condition -LRB- without penile erection -RRB- , sexual stimulation of the penis increased rCBF in an area of the right hemisphere encompassing the posterior insula and adjacent posterior part of the secondary somatosensory cortex -LRB- SII -RRB- and decreased rCBF in the right amygdala .
16255007|Deactivation of the amygdala during sexual stimulation of the penis corresponds with a decrease of vigilance during sexual performance .
1625526|Influence of amygdala catecholamines on ovarian and adrenal medullary secretion .
1625526|To accomplish this the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine -LRB- 6-OHDA -RRB- was bilaterally injected into the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- ABL -RRB- in cycling rats .
1625526|The contents of NA and DA in right and left amygdala decreased significantly in lesioned animals with respect to sham lesioned animals , but hypothalamic levels were not different between groups .
16257514|Other brain regions such as the amygdala , the cerebral cortex , the total volume hippocampus , and the head of the hippocampus did not show such a difference .
16269094|Left auditory cortex and amygdala , but right insula dominance for human laughing and crying .
16269094|The auditory cortex , amygdala , and insula in the left hemisphere were more strongly activated by original than by time-reversed laughing and crying .
16272876|Using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry in 41 healthy individuals , this study evaluated the association between the personality traits of extraversion and neuroticism , on the one hand , and individual differences in localized brain volume and gray matter concentration , on the other , with a special focus on the amygdala .
16272876|Extraversion was positively correlated with gray matter concentration in the left amygdala , whereas neuroticism was negatively correlated with gray matter concentration in the right amygdala .
16272876|Furthermore , our data are consistent with the view that amygdala reduction seen in depressed patients precedes the onset of the disease , rather than being a consequence of the illness .
16275040|Volumetric measurements of left and right hemispheres , total brain volume , lateral ventricles , hippocampus and amygdala as well as a clinical evaluation were performed .
16275040|Patients with schizophrenia showed significant ventricular enlargement and volume reduction of the hippocampus-amygdala complex compared with healthy control subjects both at baseline and follow-up .
16275930|Introversion correlated with increased activation in several regions , most prominently the bilateral amygdala .
16281289|We used functional neuroimaging to establish whether the amygdala and the medial prefrontal regions to which it projects are engaged by subliminal fearful faces and whether responses to subliminal fear are distinguished from those to supraliminal fear .
16281289|We also examined the time course of amygdala-medial prefrontal responses to supraliminal and subliminal fear .
16281289|SPM2 was used to undertake search region-of-interest -LRB- ROI -RRB- analyses for the amygdala and medial prefrontal -LRB- including anterior cingulate -RRB- cortex , and complementary whole-brain analyses .
16281289|SCRs and amygdala activity were enhanced in response to both subliminal and supraliminal fear perception .
16281289|Time series analysis showed a trend toward greater right amygdala responses to subliminal fear , but left-sided responses to supraliminal fear .
16281289|Although subcortical amygdala activity was relatively persistent for subliminal fear , supraliminal fear showed more sustained cortical activity .
16281289|The findings suggest that preverbal processing of fear may occur via a direct rostral-ventral amygdala pathway without the need for conscious surveillance , whereas elaboration of consciously attended signals of fear may rely on higher-order processing within a dorsal cortico-amygdala pathway .
16291807|tony-buchanan@uiowa.edu Abnormalities of both memory and emotion have been reported in patients with unilateral damage to the anteromedial temporal lobe , probably reflecting the functions of the amygdala and hippocampus in these processes .
16291949|Sexually dimorphic synaptic organization of the medial amygdala .
16291949|b-cooke@northwestern.edu The medial amygdala is important in social behaviors , many of which differ between males and females .
16291949|The posterodorsal subnucleus of the medial amygdala -LRB- MeApd -RRB- is particularly sensitive to gonadal steroid hormones and is a likely site for gonadal hormone regulation of sexually dimorphic social behavior .
16298172|Likewise , PBG injections had no significant effects on c-Fos expression in other central regions involved in cardiorespiratory control or cardiorespiratory reflexes -LRB- selected non-catecholaminergic nuclei in the medulla and midbrain periaqueductal gray , the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and the central nucleus of the amygdala -RRB- .
16307895|Surprisingly , the same circuit , including the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex , was activated when participants acted in a context-appropriate manner , whether being compassionate towards an injured conspecific or aggressive towards a violent assailant .
16316476|Association of the functional -1019 C/G 5-HT1A polymorphism with prefrontal cortex and amygdala activation measured with 3 T fMRI in panic disorder .
16316476|Serotonergic genes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of panic disorder and amygdala function in response to fearful stimuli .
16316476|Patients homozygous for the 5-HT1A -1019 G risk allele or patients carrying the short risk allele of the 5-HTTLPR -LRB- n = 13 -RRB- showed higher amygdala activation in response to happy faces .
16316476|This exploratory study suggests a role of the functional -1019 C/G 5-HT1A and 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms on prefrontal cortex and amygdala activation patterns in response to emotional facial stimuli .
16318368|Magnetic resonance imaging showed low intensity areas -LRB- left posterior limb of internal capsule , left cerebral peduncle of middle brain , a part of left substantia nigra , left amygdala , ventral posterior lateral nucleus and ventral anterior nucleus of left thalamus , left lateral geniculate body , and left occipital lobe -RRB- in T1 weighted image , due to the infarct in the left anterior choroidal artery territory .
16326115|Sex-related differences in amygdala functional connectivity during resting conditions .
16326115|lkilpat@uci.edu Recent neuroimaging studies have established a sex-related hemispheric lateralization of amygdala involvement in memory for emotionally arousing material .
16326115|Here , we examine the possibility that sex-related differences in amygdala involvement in memory for emotional material develop from differential patterns of amygdala functional connectivity evident in the resting brain .
16326115|Seed voxel partial least square analyses of regional cerebral blood flow data revealed significant sex-related differences in amygdala functional connectivity during resting conditions .
16326115|The right amygdala was associated with greater functional connectivity in men than in women .
16326115|In contrast , the left amygdala was associated with greater functional connectivity in women than in men .
16326115|Furthermore , the regions displaying stronger functional connectivity with the right amygdala in males -LRB- sensorimotor cortex , striatum , pulvinar -RRB- differed from those displaying stronger functional connectivity with the left amygdala in females -LRB- subgenual cortex , hypothalamus -RRB- .
16330500|Significant genotype-diagnosis interaction effects on brain morphology were noted in the left ACC , the left parahippocampal gyrus and the left amygdala-uncus .
16330500|Schizophrenics homozygous for the Val-COMT showed a significant reduction of volumes in the bilateral ACC , left amygdala-uncus , right MTG and left thalamus compared to Met-COMT schizophrenics .
16340378|RESULTS : During the placebo situation , the region-of-interest -LRB- ROI -RRB- analysis showed that emotional processing activated the bilateral amygdala .
16340378|The statistical comparison between the 2 situations -LRB- emotional vs control condition -RRB- revealed a highly significant reduction in activation of the bilateral amygdala for the levodopa fMRI session -LRB- P corrected < 0.0001 in the left and P = 0.002 in the right amygdala -RRB- .
16340378|CONCLUSION : These results suggest that administration of levodopa to healthy volunteers directly or indirectly impairs the amygdalar activation during the emotional perception task .
16340378|The authors hypothesized that amygdala activation may conform to an inverted U-shaped function in relation to changing dopamine levels .
16361059|Functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- showed increased activation following an unpleasant odor in pain related areas , including the thalamus , amygdala , insular and anterior cingulate cortices , with similar trends in primary somatosensory cortex hand/arm area .
16361607|Anterior temporal lobectomy with resection of the amygdala and anterior hippocampus resulted in cessation of seizures .
16377154|RESULTS : Relative to control subjects , the patients demonstrated -LRB- 1 -RRB- significantly greater activation of the left hippocampus while viewing all three facial expressions and -LRB- 2 -RRB- increased right amygdala activation during the initial presentation of fearful and neutral facial expressions .
16377154|CONCLUSIONS : In schizophrenia , hippocampal and amygdala activity is elevated during the passive viewing of human faces .
16380239|Does amygdalar perfusion correlate with antidepressant response to partial sleep deprivation in major depression ?
16380239|We hypothesized : -LRB- 1 -RRB- baseline perfusion in right and left amygdalae will be greater in responders than in nonresponders ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- following partial sleep deprivation -LRB- PSD -RRB- , perfusion in responders ' right and left amygdalae would decrease .
16380239|Baseline bilateral amygdalar perfusion was greater in responders than nonresponders .
16380239|Clusters involving both amygdalae decreased from baseline to PSD specifically in responders .
16380239|Right amygdalar perfusion diverged with PSD , increasing in nonresponders and decreasing in responders .
16380239|These novel amygdalar findings are consistent with the overarousal hypothesis of SD as well as other functional imaging studies showing increased baseline amygdalar activity in depression and decreased amygdalar activity with remission or antidepressant medications .
16380826|Evoked activity in the hypothalamus and amygdala of the cat in conditions of food-related motivation and emotional tension .
16380826|pavlovfml@atom.ru The amplitude-time characteristics of potentials evoked by clicks were analyzed in bilateral leads from the lateral hypothalamus and amygdala in cats in conditions of food-related motivation , emotional tension -LRB- presentation of dogs -RRB- , and orientational reactions .
16380826|In conditions of food-related motivation , as compared with the satiated state , there were decreases in the latent periods and changes in the amplitudes of the P1 and N2 components in the hypothalamus and P1 , N2 , and N3 in the amygdala .
16380826|Presentation of dogs induced decreases in the latent periods of all components -LRB- including N1 -RRB- of evoked potentials in the hypothalamus and amygdala , the most marked changes in the hypothalamus occurring on the right side and the most marked changes in the amygdala occurring on the left side .
16380826|It is concluded that there is an increase in sensory reactivity in the hypothalamus and amygdala in motivational-emotional states .
16380833|Spike activity of neurons in the amygdala and hypothalamus in bilateral leads in food motivation .
16380833|merzhan@l1.ihna.ru Measurements of mean spike frequencies and plotting of autocorrelation histograms were performed to study the nature of the spike activity of individual neurons in the lateral hypothalamus and central nucleus of the amygdala from bilateral leads in rabbits in calm waking , after 24-h food deprivation , and after satiation .
16380833|The nature of neuron spike activity changed in different ways in the hypothalamus and amygdala on transfer from hunger to satiation : 1 -RRB- the mean spike frequency changed in more hypothalamic -LRB- 85 % -RRB- than amygdalar -LRB- 56 % -RRB- cells ; 2 -RRB- as compared with calm waking and satiation , hunger was associated with a decrease in the number of neurons with periodic discharges in the delta frequency range in the hypothalamus , while the amygdala showed an increase in periodic discharges in the beta-2 frequency range ; 3 -RRB- in hunger , the hypothalamus showed a decrease in the number of neurons with burst and periodic discharges , while the amygdala showed increases in the number with equiprobabilistic discharge activity .
16380833|Assessed in terms of autocorrelation histogram shape , greater changes in the nature of neuron spike activity associated with changes in state occurred on the left side than on the right in both the hypothalamus and amygdala .
16380833|The maximal differences in neuron spike activity on the right and left sides in the hypothalamus were seen in hunger ; the greatest differences in the amygdala were seen in satiation .
16401851|OBJECTIVE : To characterize the clinical value of an fMRI task activating the amygdala in controls and patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy -LRB- MTLE -RRB- .
16401851|RESULTS : A fearful face paradigm led to significant amygdala activation -LRB- p < 0.001 -RRB- in all subjects .
16401851|Dissociated amygdala and parahippocampal activation was found in three MTLE patients .
16401851|CONCLUSIONS : fMRI activation of the amygdala evoked by an animated fearful face paradigm is strong , reproducible , and specific in individual subjects .
1640954|RESULTS : As compared with the controls , the patients had significant reductions in the volume of gray matter in the left anterior hippocampus-amygdala -LRB- by 19 percent -LSB- 95 percent confidence interval , 3 to 36 percent -RSB- -RRB- , the left parahippocampal gyrus -LRB- by 13 percent -LSB- 95 percent confidence interval , 3 to 23 percent -RSB- , vs. 8 percent on the right -RRB- , and the left superior temporal gyrus -LRB- by 15 percent -LSB- 95 percent confidence interval , 5 to 25 percent -RSB- -RRB- .
16411179|In the fMRI experiment , this shift in rating of facial expressions in presence of a fearfully spoken sentence was correlated with the hemodynamic response in the left amygdala extending into the periamygdaloid cortex , which suggests that crossmodal effects on cognitive judgments of emotional information are mediated via these neuronal structures .
16411179|Presumably , these increased extrastriate activations correspond to enhanced alertness , whereas responses within the left amygdala modulate cognitive evaluation of emotional facial expressions .
16417884|The results showed significant abnormalities in five left hemisphere structures involving the extrapyramidal and limbic systems : amygdala , hippocampus proper , parahippocampal gyrus , putamen , and globus pallidus .
16418007|At the neural level , implicit moral attitude , as indexed by increased BOLD response as a function of stimulus intensity , was associated with increased activation in the right amygdala and the ventromedial orbitofrontal cortex .
16427743|The ipsilateral or contralateral central piriform cortex received low-frequency stimulation -LRB- 15 min train of 0.1 ms pulses at 1 Hz and 50-150 muA -RRB- immediately after termination of once daily kindling stimulation -LRB- 2 s train of 1 ms pulses at 60 Hz and 150-300 microA -RRB- in the right amygdala for 30 days .
16458544|Enhancement of extinction memory consolidation : the role of the noradrenergic and GABAergic systems within the basolateral amygdala .
16458544|danb@uci.edu Evidence from previous studies indicates that the noradrenergic and GABAergic influences within the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- modulate the consolidation of memory for fear conditioning .
16458860|Besides increased activation in brain areas known to be involved in auditory as well as in neutral and emotional visual-auditory integration processes , the combined condition showed increased activation in many structures known to be involved in emotion processing -LRB- including for example amygdala , hippocampus , parahippocampus , insula , striatum , medial ventral frontal cortex , cerebellum , fusiform gyrus -RRB- .
16460697|METHODS : Participants completed an assessment of RF and participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- investigation that examined 1 -RRB- amygdala reactivity to observation of fearful/angry faces ; 2 -RRB- amygdala and right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- RVLPFC -RRB- reactivity to labeling emotions displayed in these faces ; and 3 -RRB- the relation between RVLPFC and amygdala activity during the labeling task .
16460697|RESULTS : Offspring from nonrisky families showed expected amygdala reactivity to observing fearful/angry faces and expected activation of RVLPFC while labeling the emotions , which was significantly negatively correlated -LRB- -.44 -RRB- with amygdala activation .
16460697|Offspring from risky families showed little amygdala activation during the observation task and a strong positive correlation -LRB- +.66 -RRB- between RVLPFC and amygdala activation in the labeling task , suggesting a possible dysregulation in the neural systems involved in responses to emotional stimuli .
16465484|Linkage of neuron spike activity in the right and left amygdala in food motivation and emotional tension .
16465484|pavlovfml@atom.ru Cross-correlation histograms were plotted to study the linkage of spike activity in simultaneously recorded neurons in the central nucleus of the right and left amygdala in rabbits in calm waking , after 24 hours of food deprivation , in satiation , and in emotional tension -LRB- on presentation of dogs -RRB- .
16465484|In hunger , many cases -LRB- 52 % -RRB- showed pairs in which the first neuron to discharge was in the left amygdala , this being followed by a neuron in the right amygdala -LRB- peaks from 10-50 and 130-150 msec -RRB- .
16465484|On presentation of dogs , there was an increase in the number of cases showing a common input to neurons , along with an increase in the leading role of neurons in the right amygdala -LRB- 57 % -RRB- , due to increases in inhibitory influences from this area on cells in the left amygdala .
16465484|The interaction of amygdalar neurons in these states was in most cases at frequencies in the delta range -LRB- 74 % -RRB- , mainly at 2-4 Hz .
16476409|The aim of this study was to examine whether a co-occurrence of MD is associated with structural changes in the amygdala of BPD patients .
16476409|The amygdala was delineated as `` region of interest . ''
16476409|RESULTS : Comparison of amygdala volumes between the whole group of BPD patients and control subjects revealed no significant difference .
16476409|There was a significant correlation in BPD patients between left amygdala volume and depressive symptoms as measured by HAMD .
16476409|CONCLUSIONS : Correlation of amygdala volume with depression in BPD patients might indicate a causal relationship .
16476409|Future studies should clarify whether amygdala enlargement is a risk factor for MD in BPD patients or a consequence of the affective disorder .
16510224|suslow@uni-muenster.de It has been argued that critical functions of the human amygdala are to modulate the moment-to-moment vigilance level and to enhance the processing and the consolidation of memories of emotionally arousing material .
16510224|Activation of the left and right amygdala in response to the masked fearful faces -LRB- compared to neutral faces -RRB- was significantly correlated with the number of fearful faces detected .
16510224|In addition , right but not left amygdala activation in response to the masked angry faces was significantly related to the number of angry faces detected .
16510224|The present findings underscore the role of the amygdala in the detection and consolidation of memory for marginally perceptible threatening facial expression .

16511646|OBJECTIVE : To determine the extent of regional medial temporal lobe atrophy , including hippocampus , amygdala , and entorhinal , perirhinal , and parahippocampal cortices in mild AD patients and healthy controls , and to compare diagnostic accuracy across volumetric markers .
16517167|Intraoperative electrocorticography is recorded over the hippocampus and amygdala .
16517214|Structures of interest comprised hippocampus , amygdala , and entorhinal , perirhinal , parahippocampal , and temporopolar cortices .
16521485|MRI revealed a discrete lesion in the right amygdala/uncus region .
16525417|Both tasks were associated with relative decreases in activity in the right amygdala and the hippocampus .
16525417|The observed social anxiety-related changes in distributed neural activity are consistent with cognitive models of SAD and adaptive decreases in amygdala activity in response to social anxiogenics , and support the association of altered frontal cortical responses with treatment response .
16528524|RESULTS : SPM analysis of pre - and post-lamotrigine brain SPECT images showed decreased perfusion in bilateral dorsomedial nuclei of thalami , bilateral uncus , right amygdala , left subcallosal gyrus , right superior and inferior frontal gyri , right precentral gyrus , bilateral superior and inferior temporal gyri and brainstem -LRB- pons , medulla -RRB- after lamotrigine medication at a false discovery rate-corrected p < 0.05 .
16531690|Only the unresolved participants showed increasing activation of medial temporal regions , including the amygdala and the hippocampus , in the course of the AAP task .
16540253|They confirm a morality network that includes the ventromedial frontal cortex , the orbitofrontal cortex , and the amygdalae .
16540253|The right ventromedial region is critical for the emotional tagging of moral situations , the orbitofrontal cortex responds to social cues and mitigates impulsive reactions , and the amygdalae are necessary for threat detection and moral learning .
16550383|RESULTS : In mild AD patients , FDG-PET indicated significant reductions in glucose metabolism in the bilateral posterior cingulate gyri and the right parietotemporal area , while VBM analysis showed a significant decrease in grey matter volume density in the bilateral amygdala/hippocampus complex , compared with the normal control group .
16552015|Apparent diffusion coefficient mapping of the hippocampus and the amygdala in pharmaco-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy .
16552015|METHODS : Fifty-five patients and 20 age-matched controls were studied with hippocampal and amygdala ADC maps -LRB- HADC and AMYADC -RRB- , volumes -LRB- HCVOL , AMYVOL -RRB- , T2 relaxometry -LRB- HCT2 , AMYT2 -RRB- , and hippocampal N-acetylaspartate to choline and creatine/phosphocreatine ratios -LRB- HCSI -RRB- .
16552015|In TLE groups with right -LRB- n = 29 -RRB- or left epileptogenic foci -LRB- n = 26 -RRB- , group comparisons showed that ADC mapping detected changes ipsilateral to the focus in the hippocampus -LRB- P < .01 -RRB- and the amygdala -LRB- P < .05 -RRB- , accordingly with the volumes , T2 maps , and HCSI .
16552015|Significant Pearson correlations -LRB- 2-tailed -RRB- were obtained between ADC maps and the volume of the hippocampus -LRB- r = -0.64 -RRB- and of the amygdala -LRB- r = -0.55 ; both P < .01 -RRB- , T2 -LRB- r = 0.70 , r = 0.29 ; both P < .01 -RRB- , but not with HCSI .
16552015|Individual ADC analysis showed ipsilateral pathology in 82 % of cases -LRB- hippocampus -RRB- and 35 % -LRB- amygdala -RRB- and included a moderate association between ipsilateral HADC and AMYADC -LRB- r = 0.54 ; P < .01 -RRB- .
16552015|Bilateral abnormalities were found in 7 % -LRB- hippocampus -RRB- and 5 % -LRB- amygdala -RRB- of cases .
16552015|Except for HCSI and the amygdala data , there were significant correlations between the asymmetry indices and the duration of epilepsy -LRB- HADC : r = 0.42 ; HCT2 : r = 0.50 ; HCVOL : r = 0.35 ; all P < .01 -RRB- .
16569246|RESULTS : No effects were found in the prefrontal cortex , olfactory tubercle and amygdala , whereas the pharmacological impact induced a slight but significant DA hyperinnervation in the nucleus accumbens .
16569246|The present results contrast with the previously published long-term effects of early postnatal MA treatment that lead to a restraint of the maturation of DA fibres in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex and a concomitant overshoot innervation in the amygdala .
16571552|METHODS : Three brain regions of interest were selected from magnetic resonance imaging slices in 15 young , right-handed , male schizophrenia patients : the STG , the anterior hippocampus , and the amygdala .
16571552|BIZ ratings were not significantly correlated with either the left or right anterior hippocampus or amygdala volumes .
16571552|The BPRS Conceptual Disorganisation rating was not significantly related to the STG , anterior hippocampus , or amygdala volumes .
16575427|Female subjects demonstrated a negative correlation between TAS scores and activation in the right amygdala , thalamus , putamen , and left frontal and bilateral temporal cortices , and no positive correlations with TAS scores during stressful , compared with neutral , imagery .
16575552|Additional increases were observed in the left amygdala/parahippocampal gyrus , a structure also involved in emotional arousal .
16585468|MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Serotonin 1A receptor BP was examined by positron emission tomography using the radioligand 4,2 '' - -LRB- methoxyphenyl -RRB- -1 - -LSB- 2 '' - -LRB- N-2 '' - pyridinyl -RRB- - p-fluorobenzamido -RSB- ethylpiperazine in the raphe , amygdala , hippocampus , and anterior cingulate cortex in monkeys characterized by behavioral observation as depressed or not depressed .
16585468|The 5-HT -LRB- 1A -RRB- BP in the amygdala and hippocampus was associated with aggression and submission .
16585468|The 5-HT -LRB- 1A -RRB- receptor BP was inversely associated with heart rate in the raphe , left cingulate , and right amygdala .
16597782|The findings show that individuals with Williams syndrome tend to be more engaged in musical activities than others , and I report a possible neuroanatomical correlate of this engagement , with increased activation in the right amygdala to music and to noise .
16602055|INTRODUCTION : Temporal lobe and amygdala are structures that participate in emotional processing .
16616418|Group analysis showed that tract paths could be defined and their likelihood quantified for connections between the PAG and separately for the NCF , to the prefrontal cortex , amygdala , thalamus , hypothalamus and rostroventral medial medulla bilaterally .
16638081|Post-traumatic stress disorder and amygdala-hippocampectomy .
16638081|Because seizures were resistant to drug therapy , she underwent amygdala-hippocampectomy at the age of 18 .
16638081|CONCLUSION : There is evidence that the amygdala-hippocampal region is both functionally and morphologically involved in the aetiology of PTSD .
16638081|The removal of this marked neuroanatomical region and the resulting disconnection and asymmetry between right and left amygdala-hippocampal region might be seen as an evidence for this region aetiologically being involved in the patient 's PTSD symptoms .
16641244|For the PR group , SERT BP was decreased by 10-23 % across a range of brain areas consisting of the raphe , thalamus , hypothalamus , caudate and putamen , globus pallidum , anterior cingulate gyrus , and medial temporal regions , including amygdala and hippocampus -LRB- cluster-level corrected p = 0.002 -RRB- .
16648880|Moreover , social , but not mechanical , interpretations elicited activity in regions implicated in the perception and modulation of emotion -LRB- right amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex -RRB- .
16649818|Neurally , in the SCZ-SU group , significant loci of activation were identified in the right medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- Brodmann 's area -LSB- BA -RSB- 10 -RRB- , left medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- BA 10 -RRB- , right orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- BA 47 -RRB- , and left amygdala .
16670653|katesw@upstate.edu OBJECTIVE : To investigate the association between mesial temporal lobe morphology , ratios of prefrontal cortex to amygdala and hippocampus volumes , and psychiatric symptomatology in children and adolescents with velocardiofacial syndrome -LRB- VCFS -RRB- .
16670653|METHOD : Scores on behavioral rating scales and volumetric measures of the amygdala , hippocampus , and prefrontal cortex based on high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging were compared among 47 children with VCFS , 15 of their siblings , and 18 community controls .
16670653|RESULTS : After covarying for whole brain volume , children with VCFS exhibited 11 % greater volume of the left amygdala -LRB- p = .002 -RRB- and 8 % greater volume of the right amygdala -LRB- p = .01 -RRB- .
16670653|Children with VCFS exhibited smaller volumetric ratios of prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex to amygdala , but not prefrontal cortex to hippocampus .
16670653|For children with VCFS , but not for the comparison sample , larger volumes of the amygdala and smaller ratios of prefrontal cortex to amygdala were associated with higher scores on the Internalizing , Externalizing , Anxiety , and Aggression scales of the Child Behavior Checklist and on the parent version of the Young Mania Rating Scale .
16670653|CONCLUSIONS : These findings suggest that the prefrontal cortex-amygdala circuit that underlies emotional processing is disrupted in children with VCFS and may be an important neurobiological substrate of psychiatric disorder in these children .
16682212|Rats were electrically kindled via the ipsilateral basolateral amygdala .
16682795|In cases homozygous for the epsilon4 allele -LRB- n = 8 -RRB- versus noncarriers , the greatest atrophy was located in the right amygdala followed by the right parahippocampal gyrus , the left amygdala and the left medial dorsal thalamic nucleus .
16698125|Total T concentrations were positively correlated with rCBF in the left putamen , bilateral thalamus , and left inferior frontal cortex and negatively correlated with amygdala rCBF bilaterally .
16704749|RESULTS : When contrasting unresolved and resolved life events , patients showed significant bilateral activation of frontotemporal areas including the insula , amygdala , and the anterior cingulate cortex , the left posterior cingulate cortex , right occipital cortex , the bilateral cerebellum and the midbrain .
16704749|The 2 x 2 factorial analysis -LRB- DeltaBPD - Deltacontrols -RRB- revealed similar results with bilateral activation of the frontal cortex including parts of the insula and of the orbitofrontal cortex , temporal activation including the amygdala , activation of the right occipital cortex , and parts of the cerebellum .
16704749|CONCLUSIONS : The activation of both , the amygdala and prefrontal areas , might reflect an increased effortful but insufficient attempt to control intensive emotions during the recall of unresolved life events in patients with BPD .
16708026|Furthermore , there was greater activation in the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex , right anterior temporal pole , right amygdala , and right insula in depressed individuals .
16713587|Mood alters amygdala activation to sad distractors during an attentional task .
16713587|The amygdala is poised to mediate internal mood and external event processing because of its connections with both the internal milieu and the sensory world .
16713587|There is little evidence showing that the amygdala 's response to sad sensory stimuli is functionally modulated by mood state , however .
16713587|METHODS : We investigated the impact of mood on amygdala activation evoked by sad and neutral pictures presented as distractors during an attentional oddball task .
16720947|Stimulation of the basolateral amygdala improves the acquisition of a motor skill .
16720947|METHODS : Young , male Sprague Dawley rats were implanted stereotactically with one electrode in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and trained to acquire a motor skill using their right anterior limb .
16720947|CONCLUSIONS : Reinforcement of neural plasticity by the activation of the amygdala is not restricted to hippocampus-dependent explicit memory , but it might represent a universal mechanism to modulate plasticity .
16730755|Expressive gestures involved additional areas related to social perception -LRB- bilateral STS , temporal poles , medial prefrontal lobe -RRB- , emotional processing -LRB- bilateral amygdala , bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- VLPFC -RRB- , speech and language processing -LRB- Broca 's and Wernicke 's areas -RRB- and the pre-supplementary motor area -LRB- pre-SMA -RRB- .
16740852|OBJECTIVES : We previously reported that children who were subjected to early socioemotional deprivation in Romanian orphanages showed glucose hypometabolism in limbic and paralimbic structures , including the orbital frontal gyrus , infralimbic prefrontal cortex , hippocampus/amygdala , lateral temporal cortex , and the brainstem .
16754842|CONTEXT : The amygdala is associated with socioemotional function and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of autism .
16754842|OBJECTIVE : To examine the relationship between amygdalar volume at ages 3 and 4 years and severity of clinical course and outcome at 6 years of age in children with autism spectrum disorder .
16754842|DESIGN : Magnetic resonance images acquired at 3 and 4 years of age were used to measure total cerebral , amygdalar , and hippocampal volumes .
16754842|Hierarchical linear models were used to predict variability in individual linear growth trajectories as a function of IQ , total cerebral , and amygdalar or hippocampal volumes .
16754842|RESULTS : Larger right amygdalar volume was associated with more severe social and communication impairments at ages 3 and 4 years .
16754842|Larger right amygdalar volume also was predictive of poorer social and communication abilities at age 6 years , even after controlling for IQ and total cerebral volume .
16754842|CONCLUSIONS : Larger right amygdalar volume at 3 and 4 years of age , but not left amygdalar , hippocampal , or total cerebral volume , is associated with a more severe clinical course and worse outcome at age 6 years in children with autism spectrum disorder .
16754842|These results provide additional evidence that amygdalar development is implicated in the behavioral impairments found in autism .
16759342|In smoking versus baseline contrasts , additional areas of greater activation were found in AA , including the right amygdala and left caudate nucleus .
16765649|Recognition of emotion with temporal lobe epilepsy and asymmetrical amygdala damage .
16765649|helen.fowler@srht.nhs.uk PURPOSE : Impairments in emotion recognition occur when there is bilateral damage to the amygdala .
16765649|In this study , ability to recognize auditory and visual expressions of emotion was investigated in people with asymmetrical amygdala damage -LRB- AAD -RRB- and temporal lobe epilepsy -LRB- TLE -RRB- .
16769955|During cataplexy , subtracted SPECT showed hyperperfusion in right amygdala , bilateral cingulate gyri , basal ganglia , thalami , premotor cortices , sensorimotor cortices , right insula , and brainstem , and hypoperfusion in prefrontal cortex and occipital lobe .
16775796|-LSB- Quantitative volumetric analysis of the hippocampus , amygdala and entorhinal cortex : normative database for the adult Portuguese population -RSB- .
16775796|pmgp@ipp.estsp.pt INTRODUCTION : Atrophy of the hippocampus , amygdala and entorhinal cortex can be found in neurodegenerative diseases , head trauma and epilepsy and are expressed by means of volume reductions .
16775796|SUBJECTS AND METHODS : Volumes of the right and left hippocampi , amygdalae and entorhinal cortex were measured from MRI in 34 right-handed healthy volunteers , aged 19-52 years .
16775796|No asymmetry was found in the amygdala .
16775796|Gender differences were exclusively noted in the absolute amygdala volumes -LRB- male > female -RRB- but were eliminated by the normalization procedure .
16784731|The anticonvulsant effects of progesterone and its metabolites on amygdala-kindled seizures in male rats .
16784731|The purpose of this study was to measure the anticonvulsant effects of progesterone , 5alpha-dihydroprogesterone , and allopregnanolone against amygdala-kindled seizures in male rats .
16784731|The amygdala kindling model is a model of human complex partial seizures with secondary generalization .
16784731|A bipolar electrode was chronically implanted in the right amygdala of male Wistar rats .
16784731|5alpha-dihydroprogesterone had a low ED50 of 6.2 mg/kg against both the generalized component of the amygdala-kindled seizure and the focal seizure .
16784731|Progesterone is an effective anticonvulsant against the secondarily generalized component of amygdala-kindled seizures in male rats .
16784731|5alpha-dihydroprogesterone is a potent anticonvulsant against both the kindled amygdala focal discharge and the secondarily generalized seizure .
16784731|Allopregnanolone is an effective anticonvulsant against the secondarily generalized component of the seizure , but not against the amygdala focal discharge .
1680359|Under halothane anesthesia , Microdialysis probe was inserted to the kindled focus , the right amygdala , and glutamate and aspartate contents of extracellular fluid were measured from 15 minutes prior to 30 minutes after seizure by high performance liquid chromatography -LRB- HPLC -RRB- .
16806312|Differential activation of the amygdala and the ` social brain ' during fearful face-processing in Asperger Syndrome .
16806312|We employed stimuli known to reliably activate the amygdala and other social brain areas , and ROI analyses to investigate brain areas responding to facial threat as well as those showing a linear response to varying threat intensities .
16806312|The controls showed greater activation in the left amygdala and left orbito-frontal cortex , while the HFA/AS group showed greater activation in the anterior cingulate gyrus and superior temporal cortex .
16806312|The control group also showed varying responses in social brain areas to varying intensities of fearful expression , including differential activations in the left and right amygdala .
1681980|Anticonvulsant effects of ipsilateral but not contralateral microinjections of the dopamine D2 agonist LY 171555 into the nucleus accumbens of amygdala-kindled rats .
1681980|Wahnschaffe U -LRB- 1 -RRB- , Lscher W. Author information : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Department of Pharmacology , Toxicology and Pharmacy , School of Veterinary Medicine , Hannover , F.R.G. Recent radioligand binding studies demonstrated an increase in the density of dopamine D2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens ipsilateral to the stimulating electrode in amygdala - or hippocampal-kindled rats .
16828125|There are strong theoretical grounds for the hypothesis that coding stimulus reward value also involves the amygdala .
16828125|The aim of the present investigation is to address whether the amygdala is also sensitive to reward value in faces , indexed as facial attractiveness .
16828125|We hypothesized that contrary to the linear effects reported previously in OFC , the amygdala would show a non-linear effect of attractiveness by responding to both high and low attractive faces relative to middle attractive faces .
16828125|Such a non-linear response would explain previous failures to report an amygdala response to attractiveness .
16828125|Consistent with our hypothesis , right amygdala showed a predicted non-linear response profile with greater responses to highly attractive and unattractive faces compared to middle-ranked faces , independent of task .
16828125|The non-linear response profile of the amygdala is consistent with a role in sensing the value of social stimuli , a function that may also involve specific sectors of the OFC .
16839779|We found out that in patients with Alzheimer disease , not only the lateral horns were significantly affected , but also the areas adjacent to the anterior corpus callosum , the splenium of the corpus callosum , the amygdala , the thalamus , the tale of the caudate nuclei -LRB- especially the left one -RRB- , and the head of the left caudate nucleus .
16855007|The results show that the imagination of pain is associated with increased activity in several brain regions involved in the pain-related neural network , notably the anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , right anterior insula , cerebellum , posterior parietal cortex , and secondary somatosensory cortex region , whereas increased activity in the ACC and amygdala is associated with the viewing of images evoking fear .
16857388|In 5 brains , repeat segmentation resulted in intraclass correlation coefficients > 0.9 -LRB- except for the right amygdala -RRB- and an average percent voxel overlap of 90.0 % .
16857388|Brains were segmented into cerebral exterior -LRB- N = 8 -RRB- , cerebral lobes -LRB- N = 5 -RRB- , lateral ventricles -LRB- N = 8 -RRB- , cerebral cortex -LRB- N = 6 -RRB- , white matter -LRB- N = 6 -RRB- , corpus callosum -LRB- N = 7 -RRB- , deep central gray -LRB- N = 8 -RRB- , hippocampi -LRB- N = 8 -RRB- , amygdalae -LRB- N = 8 -RRB- , cerebellar hemispheres -LRB- N = 8 -RRB- , vermis -LRB- N = 8 -RRB- , midbrain -LRB- N = 8 -RRB- , pons -LRB- N = 8 -RRB- and medulla -LRB- N = 8 -RRB- .
16859412|leah.somerville@dartmouth.edu Medial temporal lobe structures such as the hippocampus have been shown to play a critical role in mnemonic processes , with additional recruitment of the amygdala when memories contain emotional content .
16859412|Thus far , studies that have examined the relationship between amygdala activity and memory have typically relied on emotional content of the kind that is rarely encountered in day-to-day interactions .
16859412|The present event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study investigates whether amygdala activity supports emotional memory during the more subtle social interactions that punctuate everyday life .
16859412|Whereas a region within the right hippocampus responded strongly to all faces that had been paired with a description , regardless of its valence , activity in the right amygdala was uniquely sensitive to faces that had been previously associated with emotional descriptions -LRB- negative and positive > neutral -RRB- .
16859412|This pattern of activity in the amygdala was preserved even when the emotional contexts associated with faces could not be explicitly retrieved , suggesting a role for the amygdala in providing a nonspecific arousal indicator in response to viewing individuals with emotionally colored pasts .
16859420|A process-specific functional dissociation of the amygdala in emotional memory .
16859420|karine.sergerie@douglas.mcgill.ca Converging evidence highlights the important role of the amygdala in the enhanced memory for emotional material .
16859420|We found significant amygdala activation associated with both successful encoding and retrieval of fearful faces .
16859420|Critically , a direct comparison between both stages revealed that whereas the right amygdala was involved in emotional memory formation , the retrieval of those memories relied on the left amygdala .
16859420|Thus , this study demonstrates a hemispheric dissociation of amygdala involvement in different stages of emotional memory in humans .
16864952|We first determined at the right amygdala afterdischarge threshold -LRB- ADT -RRB- that is the minimal electric current necessary to evoke afterdischarge .
16864952|For investigating the effects of dantrolene on the development of kindling , rats were stimulated once daily at the right amygdala with a current , 10 % larger than ADT , one hour after either dantrolene or vehicle had been injected intraperitoneally .
16875846|Moreover , we assessed whether functional relationships between amygdala and any brain area changed depending the state of vigilance .
16875846|Only the activity within in the insula was found to covary with the amygdala , significantly more tightly during wakefulness than during REMS in relation to the VHR .
16875846|The functional connectivity between the amygdala and the insular cortex , two brain areas involved in cardiovascular regulation , differs significantly in REMS as compared to wakefulness .
16876130|RESULTS : GG homozygotes had greater right -LRB- R -RRB- dorsal amygdala -LRB- p < .008 -RRB- , bilateral anterior cingulate -LRB- p < .009 -RRB- , and R caudate reactivity -LRB- p < .015 -RRB- than T-allele carriers .
16880223|Emotion induction after direct intracerebral stimulations of human amygdala .
16880223|Very few studies in humans have quantified the effect obtained after direct electrical stimulation of the amygdala , in terms of both emotional and physiological responses .
16880223|We assessed the effects of direct electric stimulations in either the right or the left amygdala on verbally self-reported emotions -LRB- Izard scale -RRB- and on psychophysiological markers of emotions by recording skin conductance responses -LRB- SCRs -RRB- and by measuring the electromyographic responses of the corrugator supercilii -LRB- EMGc -RRB- .
16880223|According to responses on Izard scales , electrical stimulations of the right amygdala induced negative emotions , especially fear and sadness .
16880223|In contrast , stimulations of the left amygdala were able to induce either pleasant -LRB- happiness -RRB- or unpleasant -LRB- fear , anxiety , sadness -RRB- emotions .
16880223|These findings provide direct in vivo evidence that the human amygdala is involved in emotional experiences and strengthen the hypothesis of a functional asymmetry of the amygdala for valence and arousal processing .
16889985|yosakai-tky@umin.ac.jp Several neuroanatomical hypotheses of panic disorder have been proposed focusing on the significant role of the amygdala and PAG-related `` panic neurocircuitry . ''
16908199|agarrett@stanford.edu fMRI was used to dissociate neural responses temporally associated with the subjective experience of emotion from those associated with the perception of emotion-inducing stimuli in order to better define the emotion-related functions of the amygdala , lateral orbital frontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- , and hippocampus .
16908199|fMRI results showed that viewing aversive pictures activated the amygdala , lateral OFC , and hippocampus .
16908199|Subjective emotion -LRB- present both during and after aversive pictures -RRB- was temporally associated with activation in the right lateral OFC and left hippocampus but not the amygdala .
16908199|The results support direct amygdala involvement in emotion perception but suggest that amygdala activation is not temporally associated with subjective emotion that occurs after the offset of emotion-related stimuli .
1691672|Intra-VTA administration of DiMe-C7 increased levels of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid -LRB- DOPAC -RRB- in the nucleus accumbens , olfactory tubercules and right amygdala , indicating increased mesolimbic dopamine metabolism .
1691672|DOPAC levels were not significantly increased in the frontal cortex , left amygdala or striatum .
1691672|DiMe-C7 also increased 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid -LRB- 5-HIAA -RRB- levels in the amygdala but this was only statistically significant in the right amygdala .
16922878|PURPOSE : The right -LRB- nondominant -RRB- amygdala is crucial for processing facial emotion recognition -LRB- FER -RRB- .
16922878|Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy -LRB- TLE -RRB- associated with mesial temporal sclerosis -LRB- MTS -RRB- often incur right amygdalar damage , resulting in impaired FER if TLE onset occurred before age 6 years .
16922878|These results indicate that proper development of the right amygdala is necessary for optimal fear recognition , with other neural processes unable to compensate for early amygdalar damage .
16938433|PURPOSE : The present study was performed to understand the characteristics of septal kindling in rats , especially the efficacies of antiepileptic drugs in comparison with amygdala kindling .
16938433|METHODS : Under pentobarbital anesthesia , rats were fixed to a stereotaxic apparatus , and electrodes were implanted into the right frontal cortex , the hippocampus , the lateral septal and the amygdala .
16938433|Bipolar stimulation was applied to the lateral septal or the amygdala every day until a generalized seizure was obtained .
16938433|In addition , wet dog shakes were observed during the septal kindling procedure , different from amygdala kindling .
16938433|CBZ and ZNS caused a more potent inhibition of septal-kindled seizures than amygdala kindled seizures , whereas CLB inhibited both septal and amygdala kindled seizures to almost the same extent .
16938433|CONCLUSION : Septal kindling was confirmed to possess some characteristics , which were evidently different from that of amygdala kindling .
16942757|Women have a higher concentration in the orbitofrontal cortex involving Brodmann 's areas 10 , 11 and 25 and temporomedial cortex -LRB- bilateral hippocampus and right amygdala -RRB- , as well as their left basal insular cortex .
16942837|During fear perception , age was significantly positively correlated with greater functional activity within the prefrontal cortex , whereas no significant relationship was evident between age and activity in the amygdala .
16942837|The hypothesis of age related decreases in amygdala activity was not supported , but may have been due to low signal-to-noise and inadequate power in the present sample to resolve subtle changes in this small structure .
16950220|This positron emission tomography -LRB- PET -RRB- study evaluated how the activity in the SP-NK1 receptor system in the amygdala was affected by fear provocation in subjects with specific phobia .
16950220|RESULTS : The uptake of the labeled NK1 receptor antagonist was significantly reduced in the right amygdala during phobic stimulation .
16950220|In the left amygdala no significant differences were found between phobic and non-phobic conditions .
16950220|There was a negative correlation in the right , but not left , amygdala between subjective anxiety ratings and NK1 tracer binding .
16950220|CONCLUSIONS : Fear provocation affects the SP-NK1 receptor system in the right amygdala .
16959817|Such unpleasant musical experiences have been shown to activate a network of brain structures involved in emotion , mostly located in the medial temporal lobe : the parahippocampal gyrus , amygdala , hippocampus and temporal pole .
16959817|Moreover , the impairment differed from that induced by amygdala damage alone .
16959817|These findings are consistent with a two-dimensional model of defensive responses to aversive stimuli , in which the PHC and the amygdala subserve different roles .
16963565|The effect of anticipation and the specificity of sex differences for amygdala and hippocampus function in emotional memory .
16963565|Key brain areas involved in emotional memory are the amygdala and hippocampus , which are also recruited during aversion and its anticipation .
16963565|In anticipation of aversive pictures , bilateral dorsal amygdala and anterior hippocampus activations were associated with better immediate recognition memory .
16963565|Bilateral ventral amygdala activations in response to aversive pictures predicted delayed memory only .
16963565|We found that previously reported sex differences of memory associations with left amygdala for women and with right amygdala for men were confined to the ventral amygdala during picture viewing and delayed memory .
16963565|Results support an established animal model elucidating the functional neuroanatomy of the amygdala and hippocampus in emotional memory , highlight the importance of anticipatory processes in such memory for aversive events , and extend neuroanatomical evidence of sex differences for emotional memory .
16996281|A brain MRI revealed a high signal in the right amygdala , hippocampus and thalamus , instead of the pons .
16997391|Brain areas investigated included the amygdala , periaqueductal gray -LRB- PAG -RRB- , and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- , all areas considered to be part of the `` fear circuit '' .
16997391|In contrast , EPM exposure did not elevate pCREB-lir in the amygdala or BNST in predator stressed rats .
16999337|The above mentioned symptoms might be originated not only from the disturbance of visuospacial recognition , which involves the limbic system -LRB- especially amygdala -RRB- , medial frontal cortex , and right hemisphere of the brain , but also from the disturbance of recursive consciousness , due to diffusely damaged brain regions with Lewy body pathology .
17001274|The study yielded two main findings : -LRB- i -RRB- processing of emotional distracters was associated with enhanced functional coupling between the amygdala and the inferior frontal cortex and -LRB- ii -RRB- the inferior frontal cortex showed a left-lateralized activation pattern discriminating successful from unsuccessful trials in the presence of emotional distraction .
17010135|Individual differences in ethanol self-administration following withdrawal are associated with asymmetric changes in dopamine and serotonin in the medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala .
17010135|carlosj@mail.amc.edu BACKGROUND : Ethanol withdrawal alters brain neurochemistry , causes asymmetric activation of neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- and amygdala -LRB- AMY -RRB- , and increases ethanol craving and drinking .
17010993|Anticipation of aversive stimuli activates extended amygdala in unipolar depression .
17010993|Compared to the healthy control group , during expectation of negative vs. neutral or positive stimuli the patients showed significantly more activation within the sublenticular extended dorsal amygdala -LRB- SLEA -RRB- bilaterally but did not differ from controls upon expecting positive stimuli .
17010993|Hamilton depression scores of the patients correlated positively with activation of the left and right ventral amygdala during expectation of negative stimuli .
17010993|Furthermore , we found a negative correlation of ventral amygdala activation in the patients with reappraisal scores comprising the ability to limit emotional responding by re-interpreting emotion-eliciting situations .
17010993|We interpret enhanced activation in the amygdala/SLEA as a possible consequence of altered future thinking in patients suffering from depression .
17015084|Moreover , implicit processing of affective intonation seems to be bound to subcortical regions mediating automatic induction of specific emotional reactions such as activation of the amygdala in response to fearful stimuli .
17019406|A stronger mood lowering effect was associated with less accurate performance on faces expressing a negative emotion in the incidental task and a stronger right amygdala response to fearful faces in comparison to happy faces .
17019406|These results were explained in terms of a mood-induced bias leading to a stronger impact of the expressed negative emotion which subsequently leads to more interference in the incidental task and a stronger amygdala response .
17021179|Genes influenced individual differences in left and right superior occipitofrontal fascicle -LRB- heritability up to 0.79 and 0.77 -RRB- , corpus callosum -LRB- 0.82 , 0.80 -RRB- , optic radiation -LRB- 0.69 , 0.79 -RRB- , corticospinal tract -LRB- 0.78 , 0.79 -RRB- , medial frontal cortex -LRB- 0.78 , 0.83 -RRB- , superior frontal cortex -LRB- 0.76 , 0.80 -RRB- , superior temporal cortex -LRB- 0.80 , 0.77 -RRB- , left occipital cortex -LRB- 0.85 -RRB- , left postcentral cortex -LRB- 0.83 -RRB- , left posterior cingulate cortex -LRB- 0.83 -RRB- , right parahippocampal cortex -LRB- 0.69 -RRB- , and amygdala -LRB- 0.80 , 0.55 -RRB- .
17027930|RESULTS : Metabolism was increased in the bilateral amygdala , accumbens area , and anteroventral putamen , left orbitofrontal cortex and right pregenual anterior cingulate cortex in depressives versus control subjects .
17027930|CONCLUSIONS : These results confirm previous reports that bipolar depression is associated with abnormally increased metabolism in the amygdala , ventral striatum , orbitofrontal cortex , anterior cingulate , and anterior insula , and extend these results to bipolar disorder type II depressives on lithium or divalproex .
17030472|The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential neuroprotective effects of estrogens in aging on brain regions with high levels of estrogen receptors , namely the hippocampus -LRB- HC -RRB- and the amygdala -LRB- AG -RRB- .
17030660|Measurements of the amygdala and hippocampus in pathologically confirmed Alzheimer disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration .
17030660|OBJECTIVE : To assess the diagnostic utility of magnetic resonance imaging-derived amygdala and hippocampal volumes from patients with pathologically proved AD and FTLD .
17030660|DESIGN : Cross-sectional volumetric magnetic resonance imaging study of the hippocampus and amygdala .
17030660|MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Hippocampal and amygdala volumes .
17030660|RESULTS : Geometric mean amygdala and hippocampal volumes were , respectively , 15.0 % -LRB- 95 % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , 4.2 % -24.5 % -RRB- and 16.4 % -LRB- 95 % CI , 5.9 % -25.6 % -RRB- lower in the AD than in the control group .
17030660|In FTLD , the equivalent differences were 43.1 % -LRB- 95 % CI , 31.9 % -52.6 % -RRB- in the amygdala and 36.1 % -LRB- 95 % CI , 27.5 % -43.7 % -RRB- in the hippocampus .
17030660|On average , the left amygdala was 39 % smaller in semantic dementia than in frontal variant FTLD , whereas the right amygdala was only 1 % smaller .
17030660|However , severe or asymmetrical amygdala atrophy should suggest FTLD .
17042790|Preferential responses in amygdala and insula during presentation of facial contempt and disgust .
17042790|The imaging data indicated significant activity in the amygdala and in globus pallidus and putamen during processing of contemptuous faces .
17042790|Moreover , direct comparisons of contempt vs. disgust yielded significantly different activations in the amygdala .
17055981|The right fusiform face area -LRB- FFA -RRB- , the right superior temporal sulcus -LRB- STS -RRB- , and the amygdala responded strongly to visible faces .
17055981|Activity in the amygdala was equally strong in both the visible and invisible conditions to fearful faces but much weaker in the invisible condition for the neutral faces .
17055981|In the invisible condition , amygdala activity was highly correlated with that of the STS but not with FFA .
17058525|Bilateral MR volumetry of the amygdala in chronic PTSD patients .
17058525|goran.pavlisa@zg.htnet.hr Posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- patients experience symptoms which implicate dysfunction of emotional memory circuits , and possible damage of the amygdala .
17058525|Laterality differences in activity of the amygdala have been reported in PTSD patients , with presumed adaptive plasticity in the hippocampus and the amygdala .
17058525|The aim of this study was to investigate possible interhemispheric differences of amygdalar volume in chronic PTSD patients , with calculation of right-to-left volume ratios .
17058525|The mean right amygdalar volume of our patients was significantly smaller than the left one -LRB- p = 0.031 -RRB- , with the right-to-left volume ratio of 0.96 + / - 0.06 .
17058525|This tendency towards smaller right amygdala may be an acquired effect as a result of stress-induced plasticity , however we can not exclude the possibility of a predisposing condition .
17064731|Moreover the four DBT responders displayed reduction of HRF modulation in the left amygdala and both hippocampi .
17065334|Insulin was associated with increased metabolism in ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex and with decreased metabolism in right amygdala/hippocampus and cerebellar vermis -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- , relative to global brain .
17067740|Overall brain activity for spontaneous pain of PHN involved affective and sensory-discriminative areas : thalamus , primary and secondary somatosensory , insula and anterior cingulate cortices , as well as areas involved in emotion , hedonics , reward , and punishment : ventral striatum , amygdala , orbital frontal cortex , and ventral tegmental area .
17067740|The sensory and affective activations only responded to the short-term treatment -LRB- 6h of Lidoderm -RRB- ; while the ventral striatum and amygdala -LRB- reward-related regions -RRB- decreased mainly with longer-term treatment -LRB- 2 weeks of Lidoderm -RRB- .
17067740|The ventral striatal and amygdala activity best reflected changes in NPS , which was modulated only with longer-term treatment .
17069470|A parametric analysis showed that the left amygdala was activated in relation to subjective amusement .
17069470|We hypothesize that the amygdala plays a key role in giving humor an emotional dimension .
17084970|The anticonvulsant effects of allopregnanolone against amygdala-kindled seizures in female rats .
17084970|In 2003 , we reported that progesterone 's first metabolite , 5alpha-dihydroprogesterone -LRB- 5alpha-DHP -RRB- , has strong anticonvulsant effects in amygdala-kindled female rats .
17084970|These occur without sedation , and involve suppression of the kindled amygdala focus , as well as the secondarily generalized kindled seizure .
17084970|The purpose of this study was to investigate the anticonvulsant actions of progesterone 's secondary metabolite , allopregnanolone , in the amygdala kindling model .
17084970|Adult female Wistar rats were implanted with chronic indwelling electrodes in the right amygdala , and kindled to 30 stage 5 seizures .
17084970|Varying doses of allopregnanolone were then administered to each subject in randomized order , and the effects on the kindled amygdala focus and the secondarily generalized kindled seizure were observed .
17084970|Even at the highest doses tested , however , there was no suppression of the kindled amygdala focus .
17084970|Allopregnanolone has anticonvulsant effects -- and a good therapeutic index -- against the secondarily generalized component of amygdala-kindled seizures .
17091130|Lower mu-opioid receptor BP was also detected during the denicotinized smoking condition in the smoker group , compared to baseline scans in non-smokers , in the cingulate cortex , thalamus , ventral basal ganglia , and amygdala .
17091130|These reductions were reversed during the average nicotine condition in the thalamus , ventral basal ganglia and amygdala .
17097071|RESULTS : In bipolar patients , in response to both angry and happy faces relative to neutral faces , we observed reduced activation of right rostral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex together with increased activity in right pregenual anterior cingulate , amygdala , and paralimbic cortex .
17097071|Reduced activation in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex might reflect diminished top-down control that leads to the observed exaggerated activation in amygdala and paralimbic areas .
17099553|Additionally , a number of reports described morphometric abnormalities in various subcortical structures , such as amygdala , basal ganglia and thalamus .
17099553|When increase in volume is reported , it is preferentially localised in the left cerebral hemi-sphere and more specifically in prefrontal and temporal cortices and in amygdala .
17110687|Hippocampal volumes were smaller ipsilateral to the seizure focus , but there was no significant volume loss involving the amygdala , caudate , or cerebellum .
17110687|Hippocampal and amygdalar right-to-left VRs differed significantly between right and left TLE groups and controls , whereas thalamic right-to-left VRs differed only between the TLE groups .
17110687|Caudate ipsilateral-to-contralateral VRs were positively , whereas amygdalar and cerebellar VRs were negatively , correlated with GTCS frequency .
17110687|CONCLUSIONS : Unilateral amygdalar and bilateral thalamic volume loss , in the absence of caudate head atrophy , is likely to reflect seizure-induced injury due to TLE .
17110687|Correlations of VRs affecting the amygdala , caudate , and cerebellum with GTCS frequency may also reflect injury or a prediposition for secondary generalization .
17113049|Volume of left amygdala subregion predicted temperamental trait of harm avoidance in female young subjects .
17113049|When the score on the harm avoidance -LRB- HA -RRB- subscale was used as a dependent variable , the multiple regression analysis revealed that the HA score positively correlated with the volume of the part of left amygdala .
17114143|OBJECTIVES : Functional neuroimaging studies have revealed that the hippocampus and amygdala are involved in tinnitus perception .
17114143|The amygdala and hippocampus are supplied by the anterior choroidal artery .
17116389|Female Wistar rats were implanted with electrodes in the right amygdala , and initial -- pre-kindling -- afterdischarge thresholds -LRB- ADT 's -RRB- were determined 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 weeks after electrode implantation .
17118565|Hemispheric differences in protein kinase C betaII levels in the rat amygdala : baseline asymmetry and lateralized changes associated with cue and context in a classical fear conditioning paradigm .
17118565|The amygdala is critically important for fear learning , and specific kinases have been implicated as contributors to the mechanisms that underlie learning .
17118565|We examined levels of protein kinase C betaII -LRB- PKC betaII -RRB- in the left and right lateral and basolateral nuclei -LRB- LA/BLA -RRB- of the amygdala from animals that were classically fear conditioned with tones as cues and footshocks .
17123557|Stroke patients reported an unpleasant experience to frightening stimuli similar to healthy controls , yet showed significantly lower activity in the right ventral lateral and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , amygdala , thalamus , and retrosplenial cingulate gyrus .
17131114|The volumes of six subregions were measured bilaterally ; these included the superior temporal gyrus -LRB- STG -RRB- , middle + inferior temporal gyrus -LRB- MITG -RRB- , fusiform gyrus -LRB- FG -RRB- , parahippocampal gyrus -LRB- PHG -RRB- , amygdala -LRB- AM -RRB- , and hippocampus -LRB- HP -RRB- .
17131586|Across these experiments we found : i -RRB- behaviorally a strong emotional word effect in the left visual field -LRB- right hemisphere - RH -RRB- of normals , correlating well with the emotional word performance of aphasic patients , pointing to a specific role of the right hemisphere ; ii -RRB- electro-physiologically a specific early -LRB- 100-140 msec -RRB- brain response to emotional words during scalp recordings in healthy subjects subsequent to right visual field -LRB- left hemisphere - LH -RRB- stimulation , that source localization procedures project to posterior areas of the right hemisphere ; iii -RRB- preliminary data of a very early -LRB- 60 msec -RRB- activation of the left amygdala in a depth-recorded epileptic patient when the same emotional words were presented to the right visual field -LRB- left hemisphere -RRB- ; and iv -RRB- a consistent gender difference showing that the above findings might be relevant for men only .
17131586|We propose that the left amygdala via extrastriate connections acts as a detector of emotional word content at a very early stage of processing ; that this amygdala response subsequently modulates the cortical response to emotional words asymmetrically , rendering the left visual cortex less sensitive to emotional words than that of the right hemisphere ; and that this modulation is gender dependent .
17133386|However , in addition , we identified hypoactivation in a more widely distributed network of brain areas involved in face processing -LSB- including the right amygdala , inferior frontal cortex -LRB- IFC -RRB- , superior temporal sulcus -LRB- STS -RRB- , and face-related somatosensory and premotor cortex -RSB- .
17140739|Male Wistar rats were implanted with bipolar electrodes aimed at the right amygdala -LRB- AMG -RRB- or at the right insular cortex -LRB- IC -RRB- .
17142246|Forty-five per cent of dreamy states were evoked by stimulation of the amygdala , 37.5 % by the hippocampus and 17.5 % by the para-hippocampal gyrus .
17142246|Given the role of the amygdala and hippocampus in autobiographic memory , their pathological activation during seizures may trigger memory recall .
17142246|This study of the dreamy state is in keeping with other evidence demonstrating the constant and central role of the amygdala and hippocampus -LRB- right as much as left -RRB- in the recall of recent and distant memories .
17142246|It demonstrates the existence of large neural networks that produce recall of memories via activation of the hippocampus , amygdala and rhinal cortex .

17156697|Association between amygdala volume and anxiety level : magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- study in autistic children .
17156697|jjuranek@uci.edu Our objective was to evaluate brain-behavior relationships between amygdala volume and anxious/depressed scores on the Child Behavior Checklist in a well-characterized population of autistic children .
17156697|Volumes for the amygdala , hippocampus , and whole brain were obtained from three-dimensional magnetic resonance images -LRB- MRIs -RRB- captured from 42 children who met the criteria for autistic disorder .
17156697|To investigate the association between anxious/depressed scores on the Child Behavior Checklist and amygdala volume , data were analyzed using linear regression methods with Pearson correlation coefficients .
17156697|A multivariate model was used to adjust for potential covariates associated with amygdala volume , including age at MRI and total brain size .
17156697|We found that anxious/depressed symptoms were significantly correlated with increased total amygdala volume -LRB- r = .386 , P = .012 -RRB- and right amygdala volume -LRB- r = .469 , P = .002 -RRB- .
17156697|The correlation between anxious/depressed symptoms and left amygdala volume did not reach statistical significance -LRB- r = .249 , P = .112 -RRB- .
17156697|Child Behavior Checklist anxious/depressed scores were found to be a significant predictor of amygdala total -LRB- P = .014 -RRB- and right amygdala -LRB- P = .002 -RRB- volumes .
17156697|In conclusion , we have identified a significant brain-behavior relationship between amygdala volume and anxious/depressed scores on the Child Behavior Checklist in our autistic cohort .
17156697|However , the existing literature on human psychiatry and behavior supports our reported evidence for a neurobiologic relationship between symptoms of anxiety and depression with amygdala structure and function .
17180713|Children with VCFS + ASD had larger right amygdala volumes .
17184978|We found a clear enhanced activity of the frontal lobe , temporal cortex , insula , cingulate , and amygdala -LRB- mainly right side -RRB- in patients when hearing emotional words in comparison with controls .
17188896|We found that the template selection method produced significantly higher ORs than did the single template method across all of the 13 analyzed ROIs -LRB- two-tailed paired t-test , right ACC at t -LRB- 8 -RRB- = 4.353 , p = 0.0024 ; right amygdala , matched paired t test t -LRB- 8 -RRB- > 3.175 , p < 0.013 ; for the remaining ROIs , t -LRB- 8 -RRB- = 4.36 , p < 0.002 -RRB- .
17199057|In the fixed-temperature condition , patients with PTSD revealed increased activation in the left hippocampus and decreased activation in the bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the right amygdala .
17199057|In the individual temperature condition , patients with PTSD showed increased activation in the right putamen and bilateral insula , as well as decreased activity in the right precentral gyrus and the right amygdala .
17199059|OBJECTIVE : To determine whether attention modulates amygdala and cortical responses to facial-threat cues differentially in adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder and in healthy adolescents .
17199059|RESULTS : While attending to their own subjective fear , patients , but not controls , showed greater activation to fearful faces than to happy faces in a distributed network including the amygdala , ventral prefrontal cortex , and anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- P < .05 , small-volume corrected , for all -RRB- .
17199059|Right amygdala findings appeared particularly strong .
17199059|Functional connectivity analyses demonstrated positive correlations among the amygdala , ventral prefrontal cortex , and anterior cingulate cortex .
17203018|antonia.new@mssm.edu Abnormal fronto-amygdala circuitry has been implicated in impulsive aggression , a core symptom of borderline personality disorder -LRB- BPD -RRB- .
17203018|Brain edges/amygdala were visually traced on MRI scans co-registered to PET scans ; rGMR was obtained for ventral and dorsal regions of the amygdala and Brodmann areas within the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- .
17203018|Correlation coefficients were calculated between rGMR for dorsal/ventral amygdala regions and PFC. Additionally , amygdala volumes and rGMR were examined in BPD and controls .
17203018|Correlations PFC/amygdala Placebo : Controls showed significant positive correlations between right orbitofrontal -LRB- OFC -RRB- and ventral , but not dorsal , amygdala .
17203018|Patients showed only weak correlations between amygdala and the anterior PFC , with no distinction between dorsal and ventral amygdala .
17203018|Correlations PFC/amygdala : m-CPP response : Controls showed positive correlations between OFC and amygdala regions , whereas patients showed positive correlations between dorsolateral PFC and amygdala .
17203018|Amygdala volume/metabolism : No group differences were found for amygdala volume , or metabolism in the placebo condition or in response to meta-chloropiperazine -LRB- m-CPP -RRB- .
17203018|We demonstrated a tight coupling of metabolic activity between right OFC and ventral amygdala in healthy subjects with dorsoventral differences in amygdala circuitry , not present in IED-BPD .
17203018|We demonstrated no significant differences in amygdala volumes or metabolism between BPD patients and controls .
17214562|Hemodynamic changes were detected in the insular cortices , anterior medial cingulate cortex -LRB- aMCC -RRB- , amygdala , and in visual areas including the fusiform gyrus .
17215168|We examined the relationship between self-reported depression severity and both structural MRI volumetry and -LSB- -LRB- 18 -RRB- F -RSB- fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography -LRB- PET -RRB- - measured resting metabolism of the amygdala and hippocampus of 18 patients with TLE .
17215168|Significant positive relationships were noted between right and left amygdala volumes and depression .
17215168|No other significant relationships were observed between amygdala PET measures , hippocampal volumes , or hippocampal PET measures and degree of depressive symptomatology .
17215168|These findings indicate that both right and left amygdala volumes are associated with depression severity among persons with TLE .
17215168|Future studies examining the potential role of extended neural regions may clarify the observed structural relationship between depressive symptoms and the amygdala .
17230052|Activation was markedly reduced in the contralateral somatosensory cortex , parietal cortex -LRB- Brodmann area 40 , BA40 -RRB- , prefrontal cortex -LRB- BA9 -RRB- , putamen and the ipsilateral amygdala during H-DP .
17239834|Areas examined included the amygdala , periqueductal gray -LRB- PAG -RRB- , bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- , anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , and dorsal medial hypothalamus -LRB- DMH -RRB- .
17239834|CPP blocked the predator stress-induced increase in pCREB-lir in the right lateral PAG and in several amygdala nuclei .
17239834|Importantly , at least in the amygdala and PAG , the pattern of pCREB-lir was hemisphere - and AP plane-dependent .
17239834|Our results suggest that several amygdala nuclei , the PAG , and the BNST , where predator stress changes pCREB-lir in a NMDA receptor-dependent manner , are candidate areas of neuroplastic change contributing to lasting changes in anxiety-like behaviors .
17251241|In both patient groups , left anterior temporal damage extended into the amygdala .
17259013|Dynamic neural activity recorded from human amygdala during fear conditioning using magnetoencephalography .
17259013|smoses@rotman-baycrest.on.ca Magnetoencephalography -LRB- MEG -RRB- was used to record the dynamics of amygdala neuronal population activity during fear conditioning in human participants .
17259013|The precise temporal resolution of MEG allowed us to address the issue of whether the amygdala responds to the onset or offset of the CS + , and/or the expectation of the initiation or offset of the an omitted auditory US .
17259013|Fear conditioning elicited differential amygdala activation for the unpaired CS + compared to the CS - , extinction and habituation .
17259013|The strongest peaks of amygdala activity occurred at an average of 270 ms in the right and 306 ms in the left hemisphere following unpaired CS + onset , and following offset at 21 ms in the left and 161 ms in the right -LRB- corresponding to an interval of 108 ms and 248 ms after the anticipated onset of the US , respectively -RRB- .
17259013|Thus , the activity dynamics suggest that the amygdala both differentially responds to stimuli and anticipates the arrival of stimuli based on prior learning of contingencies .
17259013|The amygdala also shows stimulus omission-related activation that could potentially provide feedback about experienced stimulus contingencies to modify future responding during learning and extinction .
17272671|Furthermore , men demonstrated greater BOLD signal reductions in the right amygdala , left insula , ventral anterior cingulate , and ventral medial prefrontal cortex vs. women .
17272960|The hypothalamus , hippocampus , putamen , amygdala , mid-cingulate , right insula , and cerebellar cortex showed exaggerated and phase-shifted fMRI responses in HF ; other areas showed inverted signals from those found in controls .
17280513|Individual differences in amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity are associated with evaluation speed and psychological well-being .
17280513|Using functional magnetic resonance imaging , we examined whether individual differences in amygdala activation in response to negative relative to neutral information are related to differences in the speed with which such information is evaluated , the extent to which such differences are associated with medial prefrontal cortex function , and their relationship with measures of trait anxiety and psychological well-being -LRB- PWB -RRB- .
17280513|Results indicated that faster judgments of negative relative to neutral information were associated with increased left and right amygdala activation .
17280513|Individual differences in trait anxiety did not predict variation in judgment time or in amygdala or ventral ACC activity .
17280513|These findings suggest that people high in PWB effectively recruit the ventral ACC when confronted with potentially aversive stimuli , manifest reduced activity in subcortical regions such as the amygdala , and appraise such information as less salient as reflected in slower evaluative speed .
17280517|Deceiving others : distinct neural responses of the prefrontal cortex and amygdala in simple fabrication and deception with social interactions .
17280517|The main effect of deceiving the interrogator showed activations of the ventromedial prefrontal -LRB- medial orbitofrontal -RRB- cortex and amygdala , adding new evidence that the brain regions assumed to be responsible for emotional processing or social interaction are active during deceptive behavior similar to that in real-life situations .
17280517|Our results provide clear evidence of functionally dissociable roles of the prefrontal subregions and amygdala for human deception .
17295617|In contrast , the PS animals showed strongest ILS activation in the right anterior cingulate and medial orbital gyri , amygdala , globus pallidum , and left inferior and superior temporal gyri .

17306772|Reduced amygdala activation in young adults at high risk of alcoholism : studies from the Oklahoma family health patterns project .
17306772|RESULTS : Subjects with FH - had robust activation to the faces in the region of the right and left amygdalar complexes -LRB- p 's < .05 -RRB- , while subjects with FH + had no such activation -LRB- p 's > .46 -RRB- .
17306772|The blood oxygenation level-dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- signal in the region of the amygdala was correlated with scores on the self-report measure of temperament in the combined groups -LRB- r = .51 , p < .04 -RRB- .
17306772|CONCLUSIONS : Behaviorally disinhibited temperament , found in many with FH + , may be associated with amygdalar hyporesponsiveness and a failure to avoid risky decisions , increasing the person 's liability for alcohol abuse .
17308328|As expected , olfactory activations were located in the orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- , amygdala , and rostral insula .

17313824|METHODS : Thirty-two SD rats were randomly divided into sham operation group -LRB- n = 12 , receiving the implantation of bipolar electrode into the right amygdala only -RRB- , and kindling model group which was re-divided into 2 subgroups : low grade seizure subgroup -LRB- n = 8 , undergoing stimulation 40 times a day for 7 days so as to induce seizure of stage 1 approximately 3 according to Racine grading -RRB- and high grade seizure subgroup -LRB- n = 2 , undergoing stimulation 40 times a day for 7 days so as to induce seizure of stage 4 approximately 5 -RRB- The rats were killed in 7 days and their bilateral amygdala were taken out .

17323220|Behavioral flexibility impairment with negative feedback in refractory temporal lobe epileptic patients with unilateral amygdala and hippocampal resection .
17323220|drajudithbutman@yahoo.com.ar INTRODUCTION : Patients with amygdala dysfunction generally have behavioral impairment .
17323220|Temporal lobe surgery might be a model of study of unilateral amygdala resection .
17323220|The objective of this study was to evaluate behavioral flexibility in epileptic patients who undergo amygdala resection for epilepsy surgery and evaluate its relationship with their neuropsychiatric symptoms .
17323220|MATERIAL AND METHODS : Ten epileptic patients who underwent amygdala and hippocampal resection -LRB- 6 left and 4 right -RRB- matched by age and educational level with 10 healthy controls were tested with an extensive neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric battery .
17323220|CONCLUSIONS : Patients with epilepsy who undergo unilateral hippocampal and amygdala resection appear to have alterations in the reversion capacity with an emotional component that would explain the lack of behavior flexibility that they sometimes have and that are not related with either the isolated presence of executive alterations or low intellectual quotient .
17327215|RESULTS : While in the scanner , cued recall of the clinically repressed event was associated with regional brain activations characteristic of emotional arousal , including the amygdala and right inferior frontal lobe , when compared with an equally severe event from the patient 's past , as rated by the LEDS .
17329000|Hypermetabolism was observed in the basal ganglia , thalamus , amygdala , and brainstem of both patient groups compared with controls , and in LPS patients extended to parts of cerebellum , left and right cingulate gyrus , parietal and frontal lobes .
17335325|bigsnos@aol.com BACKGROUND : Prior imaging studies suggest that patients with major depressive disorder have abnormalities in frontal and limbic neural circuitry including the amygdala , which is relatively more activated at rest and in response to negative emotional stimuli -LRB- sadness , fear , etc. -RRB- in depressed patients than in controls .
17335325|Treatment reduced fMRI activation during emotional distracters in several regions including right orbital frontal cortex , left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex , right ventromedial prefrontal cortex , right anterior cingulate cortex , right inferior frontal cortex , right amygdala/parahippocampal area , right caudate , right fusiform gyrus , and left posterior cingulate .
17335325|In addition , changes in fMRI activation in the amygdala correlated with improvements on the HAM-D -LRB- p < .05 -RRB- .
17335325|CONCLUSION : Despite the limitations of a small sample size and the lack of a placebo control group , this study demonstrated that bupropion XL therapy for 8 weeks may attenuate emotion-induced , blood-oxygen-level-dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- activation responses in the amygdala and related brain regions .
17337938|Partial seizures due to sclerosis of the right amygdala presenting as panic disorder .
17337938|A brain MRI revealed a slightly increased signal at FLAIR images in the right amygdala .
17337938|Pathological examination of removed brain tissue revealed amygdalar sclerosis and mild hippocampal neuronal loss .
17339967|Using functional neuroimaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- , we show that faces paired with emotional movies enhance BOLD responses in the bilateral temporal pole , anterior cingulate cortices , amygdala and bilateral superior temporal sulcus relative to identical faces juxtaposed with neutral movies .
17339967|An interaction was observed in the right amygdala when subtle happy and fear faces were juxtaposed with positive and negative movies , respectively .
17339967|An interaction between happy faces and negative context was also observed in bilateral amygdala suggesting that the amygdala may act to prime or tag affective value to faces .
17341309|HEV-laterality was associated with differences in hippocampal volume , amygdala/hippocampal ratios , and measures of verbal , visual and global memory .
17350290|Based on prior studies , a region of interest -LRB- ROI -RRB- analysis was also performed , including in the search area bilateral medial and orbital frontal regions , anterior cingulate gyrus , insula , amygdala and hippocampus .
17350290|In the ROI analysis , the left ventro-medial frontal cortex , right medial superior frontal gyrus , anterior insulae and left amygdala/hippocampus showed significant longitudinal changes .
17350756|We correlated Beck Depression Inventory -LRB- BDI -RRB- scores from 16 adolescents with prefrontal , anterior cingulate , and amygdala activity during functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- FMRI -RRB- of the Stroop Interference task .
17354075|RESULTS : The following neural structures have been shown to be prominent in emotional function : right and left hemisphere , corpus callosum , anterior commissure , anterior cingulate , prefrontal cortex , amygdala , and insular cortex .
17354075|The amygdalae are involved in both cognitive and affective aspects .
17356570|Correlational analyses also revealed that reported smoking for calming effects was associated with a decrease -LRB- at session 2 -RRB- in thalamus activity -LRB- bilaterally -RRB- and with an increase in amygdala activity -LRB- left hemisphere -RRB- .
17356686|Enhanced activity in ventromedial prefrontal cortex and frontal pole was observed during imitation of anger , in ventromedial prefrontal and rostral anterior cingulate during imitation of sadness and in striatal , amygdala and occipitotemporal during imitation of happiness .
17359942|We observed the activation of the amygdala during the imagining of emotional facial affect versus the imagining of neutral facial affects .
17359942|In particular , given that the processing of information concerning the facial patterning of different emotions and the enactment of behavioral responses , such as autonomic arousal , are central components of the imagery of emotional facial expressions , we postulate the central role of the amygdala in the imagery of emotional facial expressions .
17368653|Age and dementia-associated atrophy predominates in the hippocampal head and amygdala in Parkinson 's disease .
17368653|The hippocampus -LRB- HC -RRB- and amygdala -LRB- AG -RRB- decrease in volume with age and in Parkinson 's disease -LRB- PD -RRB- with -LRB- PDD -RRB- and without dementia .
17368653|In conclusion , functionally meaningful age-associated hippocampal and amygdala atrophy occurs in PD .
17376990|We sought to identify neural systems that may underlie these stress-induced behavioral changes by examining changes in mRNA content in amygdala tissue collected from 1 week separated , 1 month separated , and maternally reared infants at 3 months of age .
17376990|mRNA from the right medial temporal lobe , primarily the amygdala , was analyzed using Affymetrix U133A 2.0 arrays .
17376990|Additional in situ hybridization studies of GUCY1A3 in normal monkeys showed that this gene is expressed at adult levels by 1 week of age and that its expression is greater in the amygdala than all other brain areas examined .
17383999|The HRs in the right SN/VTA and the right hippocampus to novelty were positively correlated both with the SN/VTA MTR and hippocampus MTR but not amygdala MTR .
17383999|However , the HR of the amygdala to negative emotional valence correlated with the amygdala MTR but not with the MTR in SN/VTA or the hippocampus .
17384547|Cerebral scintigraphy displayed bilateral hypoperfusion of the frontal areas , of the anterior and internal right temporal lobe -LRB- which includes amygdala -RRB- , and of the left thalamic core .
17389903|Suicidal patients had larger right amygdala volumes than non-suicidal patients .
17389903|Abnormalities in the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala in suicidal patients may impair decision-making and predispose these patients to act more impulsively and to attempt suicide .
17400291|Bradykinin into amygdala induces thermal hyperalgesia in rats .
17400291|Administration of bradykinin -LRB- 0.25 nmol/site -RRB- into the right amygdala of adult male Wistar rats induced thermal hyperalgesia , evaluated in the paw-flick test .
17400291|Since the intra-amygdala administration of bradykinin did not alter spontaneous locomotion in the open-field test , it is unlikely that the current described hyperalgesic effect of bradykinin is due to an unspecific action on motor activity .
17400291|These findings provide evidence that bradykinin , through activation of amygdalar B -LRB- 2 -RRB- receptors induces hyperalgesia and that glutamatergic - and prostanoid-mediated mechanisms are involved in such effect .
17407506|vbenegal@gmail.com Reduced right amygdala volumes have been reported in young , alcohol-nave subjects at high risk -LRB- HR -RRB- for alcohol dependence .

17481839|RESULTS : In the informed condition with prior warning , activation was observed in the putamen extending to the insula , amygdala , and inferior frontal gyrus , and there was instant reification of the odor , while in the nave condition without prior warning , activation was observed in the anterior cingulate cortex , entorhinal cortex , putamen and inferior frontal gyrus , and recognition of the odor was difficult .
17482210|T1-weighted MRI was used to obtain total intracranial volume -LRB- TICV -RRB- , gray and white matter volume , CSF volume , hippocampus and amygdala volumes , and T2-weighted scans for white matter hyperintensity -LRB- WMH -RRB- ratings .
17482210|RESULTS : Stroke/TIA patients had more white matter hyperintensities -LRB- WMHs -RRB- , larger ventricle-to-brain ratios and smaller amygdalae than controls , but hippocampus size and gray and white matter volumes were not different .
17482210|WMHs and amygdala but not hippocampal volume distinguished stroke/TIA patients with VaD and VaMCI and without NCI and amygdala volumes .
17482210|The amygdala is smaller in stroke/TIA patients , especially in those with cognitive impairment , and this may be accounted for by white matter lesions .
17490992|Rising sound intensity : an intrinsic warning cue activating the amygdala .
17490992|Rising intensity sounds produced neural activity in the amygdala , which was accompanied by activity in intraparietal sulcus , superior temporal sulcus , and temporal plane .
17493836|Images were analyzed by statistical parametric mapping -LRB- SPM -RRB- software , and rCBF in the amygdala , hypothalamus , anterior cingulate , and insula was measured .
17511971|BACKGROUND : Previous research examining the amygdala volumes in major depressive disorder -LRB- MDD -RRB- has found conflicting evidence for association .
17511971|This study examined amygdala volume and its potential association with early onset major depression .
17511971|Core , noncore , and total amygdala volumes were estimated based on a combination of manual tracing , automated segmentation , and expert rater regional boundary definitions .
17511971|RESULTS : No significant differences were found in amygdala volumes between depressed , high-risk , or control subjects .
17511971|However , analyses comparing control monozygotic twins to randomly created control subject pairs suggest that there are familial , perhaps genetic , influences on core and total amygdala volumes .
17511971|CONCLUSIONS : Findings suggest that although there were no significant differences in amygdala volumes between groups , familial factors influence amygdala volumes .
17511971|Discrepancies between studies measuring amygdala volume in MDD may be due to differences in amygdala boundary definitions .
17513131|Groups were compared across 16 brain measures : cortical gray matter , cerebral white matter , hippocampus , amygdala , thalamus , accumbens area , caudate , putamen , pallidum , brainstem , cerebellar cortex , cerebellar white matter , lateral ventricles , inferior lateral ventricles , and the 3rd and 4th ventricles .
17513131|Compared to controls , the substance-exposed children had smaller intracranial and brain volumes , including smaller cerebral cortex , amygdala , accumbens area , putamen , pallidum , brainstem , cerebellar cortex , cerebellar white matter , and inferior lateral ventricles , and thinner cortex of the right anterior cingulate and lateral orbitofrontal cortex .
1751619|The brain areas measured bilaterally were the temporal lobe , hippocampus , amygdala , parahippocampal gyrus , head of caudate , cingulate cortex , frontal cortex , and the lateral ventricles .
1751619|Only in the schizophrenic group was P300 latency correlated negatively with the area of the right and left cingulate cortex and positively with the difference in size between the right and left amygdala .
1751619|In the subgroup of schizophrenic subjects whose P300 latency was greater than 2 standard deviations above the control mean , the area of the left cingulate cortex was significantly smaller than in controls , and the absolute right-left difference in the area of the amygdala was significantly increased .
1751619|Eye tracking dysfunction in schizophrenia was not related to changes in the amygdala or cingulate cortex but was significantly correlated with enlargement of the lateral ventricles .
17517473|Neuronal somatic volume of posteroventral medial amygdala cells from males and across the estrous cycle of female rats .
17517473|The posteroventral medial amygdala -LRB- MePV -RRB- is a brain area where gonadal hormones have neurotrophic effects in rats .
17519323|In controls , a bilateral activation of the amygdala and hippocampus was observed , whereas patients with PD involved these structures in the left hemisphere only .
17519323|CONCLUSIONS : In patients with PD , results obtained under the specific conditions used suggest that neuronal activity in the amygdala and hippocampus is reduced .
17541115|Reboxetine was associated with a reduced amygdala response to fearful faces and increased activation to happy v. neutral facial expressions in the right fusiform gyrus , relative to placebo treatment and in the absence of changes in mood .
17545449|p.sachdev@unsw.edu.au OBJECTIVE : To examine the structural abnormalities in the amygdala in stroke patients and see what contribution the amygdala may make to psychopathology and cognitive dysfunction related to stroke , because the amygdala has important roles in the processing of emotions , cognitive function , and psychiatric disorders .
17545449|Volumetric T1-weighted MRI was used to obtain amygdala volumes by manual tracing .
17545449|RESULTS : Stroke/TIA patients had smaller right amygdalar volume , more white matter hyperintensities -LRB- WMHs -RRB- , and larger lateral ventricles .
17545449|The amygdala was smaller in stroke/TIA patients with cognitive impairment compared to those without impairment .
17545449|The right amygdala volume was negatively correlated with visual new learning and not related to depression , anxiety , irritability , agitation or apathy at baseline or 12-month follow-up .
17545449|However , baseline amygdala volume was negatively correlated with Hamilton depression scores at 12 months in healthy comparison subjects .
17545449|Hypertension and atrial fibrillation , and to a lesser extent WMHs , were predictors of amygdala volume .
17545449|CONCLUSION : The amygdala is smaller in stroke/TIA patients , especially in those with cognitive impairment .
17545449|It is not related to psychopathology except that small amygdalae may increase vulnerability to depression .
17548755|Brain pathology in pedophilic offenders : evidence of volume reduction in the right amygdala and related diencephalic structures .
17548755|RESULTS : Pedophilic perpetrators showed a significant decrease of right amygdalar volume , compared with healthy controls -LRB- P = .001 -RRB- .
17548755|We observed reduced gray matter in the right amygdala , hypothalamus -LRB- bilaterally -RRB- , septal regions , substantia innominata , and bed nucleus of the striae terminalis .
17548755|In 8 of the 15 perpetrators , enlargement of the anterior temporal horn of the right lateral ventricle that adjoins the amygdala could be recognized by routine qualitative clinical assessment .
17548755|Smaller right amygdalar volumes were correlated with the propensity to commit uniform pedophilic sexual offenses exclusively -LRB- P = .006 -RRB- but not with age -LRB- P = .89 -RRB- .
17548755|Subtle defects of the right amygdala and closely related structures might be implicated in the pathogenesis of pedophilia and might possibly reflect developmental disturbances or environmental insults at critical periods .
17548799|Emotional intensity ratings were correlated with activity in several regions , including the amygdala and the hippocampus during the initial period .
17554005|Presentation of the cue in either threat condition was associated with increased CBF in the left amygdala .
17559571|In vivo EPR estimation of bilateral hippocampal antioxidant ability of rats with epileptogenesis induced by amygdalar FeCl3 microinjection .
17559571|usan@med.miyazaki-u.ac.jp PURPOSE : To measure the neural antioxidant function in the hippocampus of rats with epileptogenesis induced by microinjection of FeCl3 into the amygdala using the decay rate of the nitroxide radical as estimated by L-band electron paramagnetic resonance -LRB- EPR -RRB- spectroscopy .
17559571|Recording from chronically implanted depth electrodes showed the development of spike discharges with recurrent seizures arising from amygdalar regions with propagation into both hippocampi .
17559571|CONCLUSION : Neural antioxidant function in the hippocampi of rats with chronic seizures induced by amygdalar FeCl3 was decreased early and both ipsilaterally and bilaterally .
17566766|Structures related to evaluation of threat , left amygdala and right insula , also showed increased activity to stimulus deviance under threat .
17566766|As anxiety level increased across participants , right and left auditory cortical as well as right amygdala activity increased to stimulus deviance .
17566885|The syndrome is usually associated with lesions of the amygdala or its pathways , and it occurs after head trauma , anoxia-ischemic encephalopathy , herpes simplex encephalitis , and Reye 's syndrome .
17566885|Magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- of the brain showed encephalomalacic-gliotic changes in the anterior superior medial temporal lobe -LRB- including bilateral amygdala -RRB- , hydrocephalus , bilateral abnormal signal intensity in the white matter of the frontal region , and bilateral infarction in the centrum semiovale .
17568631|Following operation , which in all cases resulted in excision of the entire amygdala , there was no change in the ability to reason about the mental states of others , in line with the suggestion that the anterior temporal lobe is not necessary for theory of mind reasoning .
17568631|This may reflect the excision of a ` hyper-excitable ' amygdala which pre-operatively misinterprets fearful expressions as containing blends of other emotions .
17568631|Alternatively the results may represent an improvement in function of the right amygdala following the excision of a noxious inhibitory epileptogenic focus on the left .
17568631|The finding complements earlier demonstrations that damage to the right amygdala is associated with impaired processing of fear ; amelioration of right amygdala function may conversely be associated with an improvement .
17570686|Instead , we found a valence-specific regulation effect : High cognitive effort was associated with reduced activity in emotion processing regions , i.e. the amygdala and ventral striatum .
17574755|Regional gray matter volumes in a putative emotional brain circuitry comprised of the anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , amygdala and hippocampus were calculated using optimized voxel-based morphometry on high-resolution structural magnetic resonance images .
17574755|RESULTS : Region of interest analyses revealed positive associations between reported dietary omega-3 intake and gray matter volume in the subgenual ACC , the right hippocampus and the right amygdala , adjusted for total gray matter volume of brain .
17576282|Putting feelings into words : affect labeling disrupts amygdala activity in response to affective stimuli .
17576282|The results indicated that affect labeling , relative to other forms of encoding , diminished the response of the amygdala and other limbic regions to negative emotional images .
17576282|Finally , RVLPFC and amygdala activity during affect labeling were inversely correlated , a relationship that was mediated by activity in medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- MPFC -RRB- .
17576282|These results suggest that affect labeling may diminish emotional reactivity along a pathway from RVLPFC to MPFC to the amygdala .
17578311|In the L14 group , the areas which showed signal activation were : midline nuclear group of thalamus , left supra marginal gyrus , left supra temporal gyrus , right precuneous lobe , bilateral temporal pole , left precentral gyrus and left cerebellum ; those which showed signal deactivation were : bilateral hippocampus , parahippocampal gyrus , amygdala body area , rostral side / audal side of cingulate gyrus , prefrontal lobe and occipital lobe as well as left infratemporal gyrus .
17579718|Regional changes in neural activity corresponding to this behavioural interaction were observed within included right anterior insula , bilateral mid insula , and amygdala .
17579718|Finally , BOLD activity within right anterior insula and amygdala predicted the corresponding changes in perceived intensity ratings at both a group and an individual level .
1758930|Although little is known about the neuroanatomical basis of skin conductance orienting in intact normal humans , the limited literature on animals and humans with neurological and clinical disorders implicate prefrontal , temporal/amygdala , and pons brain areas in mediating skin conductance orienting .
1758930|Left and right hand skin conductance orienting was significantly associated with left and right prefrontal area -LRB- r = .44 -.60 -RRB- , area of the pons -LRB- r = .43 -.54 -RRB- , and left but not right temporal/amygdala area -LRB- r = .47 -.53 -RRB- .
1758930|Although preliminary at the present time , these results implicate prefrontal , pons , and temporal/amygdala areas in the mediation of skin conductance orienting in normal humans .
17595018|A functional MRI study of amygdala responses to angry schematic faces in social anxiety disorder .
17595018|kcevans@partners.org Neuroimaging studies using angry or contemptuous human facial photographic stimuli have suggested amygdala hyper-responsivity in social anxiety disorder -LRB- SAD -RRB- .
17595018|We sought to determine if an angry `` schematic face '' -LRB- simple line drawing -RRB- would evoke exaggerated amygdalar responses in SAD patients compared with healthy control -LRB- HC -RRB- subjects .
17595018|Compared with HC subjects , SAD patients exhibited exaggerated responses in the right amygdala for the Angry versus Neutral contrast .
17595018|The findings of exaggerated amygdala responses to angry schematic faces in SAD converge with results from earlier neuroimaging studies and illustrate the potential utility of schematic faces for probing amygdala function in psychiatric disorders .
17595018|However , extending earlier findings in healthy subjects , schematic faces appear more effective for probing amygdala responses to arousal-based -LRB- Angry versus Neutral -RRB- as opposed to valence-based -LRB- Angry versus Happy -RRB- contrasts .
17601709|This was due to the BPD group exhibiting a significantly larger magnitude of deactivation -LRB- relative to HC -RRB- in the bilateral rostral/subgenual anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- to fear and in the left ACC to fear minus neutral ; and significantly greater activation in the right amygdala to fear minus neutral .
17601709|In voxel-wise analyses constrained within these ROIs , the BPD group exhibited significant changes in the fear minus neutral contrast , with relatively less activation in the bilateral rostral/subgenual ACC , and greater activation in the right amygdala .
17601709|In the anger minus neutral contrast this pattern was reversed , with the BPD group showing greater activation in the bilateral rostral/subgenual ACC and less activation in the bilateral amygdala .
17601709|We conclude that adults with BPD exhibit changes in fronto-limbic activity in the processing of fear stimuli , with exaggerated amygdala response and impaired emotion-modulation of ACC activity .
17604030|Pubertal growth of the medial amygdala delayed by short photoperiods in the Siberian hamster , Phodopus sungorus .
17604030|b-cooke@northwestern.edu We investigated whether puberty influences the morphology of the medial nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- MeA -RRB- by comparing Siberian hamsters -LRB- Phodopus sungorus -RRB- that had been raised from birth in either long day -LRB- LD ; 16:8 h light : dark -RRB- or short day -LRB- SD ; 8:16 -RRB- photoperiods .
17604649|The level of reported anxiety during the exposure to slim bodies correlated with established measures of shape and weight concern and with brain activations in bilateral basal ganglia , left amygdala , bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate , and left inferior lateral prefrontal cortex .
17607327|Activation in the left insula , left amygdala and hippocampus , and rostral anterior cingulate cortex showed an effect of selectively attending to the vocal stimuli .
17607567|Threat sensitivity as assessed by automatic amygdala response to fearful faces predicts speed of visual search for facial expression .
17607567|ohrmann@uni-muenster.de It has been argued that the amygdala represents an integral component of a vigilance system that is primarily involved in the perception of ambiguous stimuli of biological relevance .
17607567|The present investigation was conducted to examine the relationship between automatic amygdala responsivity to fearful faces which may be interpreted as an index of trait-like threat sensitivity and spatial processing characteristics of facial emotions .
17607567|The neural response of the -LRB- right -RRB- amygdala to masked fearful faces correlated consistently with response speed to negative and neutral faces .
17607567|Neither amygdala activation during the masked presentation of angry faces nor amygdala activation during the presentation of happy faces was correlated with any of the response latencies in the face-in-the-crowd task .
17607567|Our results suggest that amygdala responsivity to masked facial expression is differentially related to the general visual search speed for facial expression .
17617382|Oxytocin attenuates amygdala responses to emotional faces regardless of valence .
17617382|Recent studies suggest that the amygdala might be the primary neuronal basis for these effects .
17617382|RESULTS : Oxytocin reduced right-sided amygdala responses to all three face categories even when the emotional content of the presented face was not evaluated explicitly .
17617382|CONCLUSIONS : Results suggest a modulatory role of oxytocin on amygdala responses to facial expressions irrespective of their valence .
17617382|Reduction of amygdala activity to positive and negative stimuli might reflect reduced uncertainty about the predictive value of a social stimulus and thereby facilitates social approach behavior .
17626877|We found evidence that emotional memories are suppressed via two time-differentiated neural mechanisms : -LRB- i -RRB- an initial suppression by the right inferior frontal gyrus over regions supporting sensory components of the memory representation -LRB- visual cortex , thalamus -RRB- , followed by -LRB- ii -RRB- right medial frontal gyrus control over regions supporting multimodal and emotional components of the memory representation -LRB- hippocampus , amygdala -RRB- , both of which are influenced by fronto-polar regions .
17631869|Altered chemical metabolites in the amygdala-hippocampus region contribute to autistic symptoms of autism spectrum disorders .
17631869|CONCLUSIONS : The results of the present study suggest that subjects with ASD have abnormalities of neural integrity in the amygdala-hippocampus region that are related to their severity and social impairments .
17634566|RESULTS : After controlling for multiple individual difference measures , dispositional mindfulness was associated with greater widespread prefrontal cortical activation , and reduced bilateral amygdala activity during affect labeling , compared with the gender labeling control task .
17634566|Further , strong negative associations were found between areas of prefrontal cortex and right amygdala responses in participants high in mindfulness but not in participants low in mindfulness .
17640621|BACKGROUND : Abnormalities in the amygdala and hippocampus have been implicated in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder -LRB- MDD -RRB- .
17640621|To our knowledge , no prior study has examined amygdala-hippocampus anatomy in pediatric patients with familial MDD -LRB- at least one first degree relative with MDD -RRB- .
17640621|METHODS : Thirty-two psychotropic-naive patients with familial MDD , aged 8-21 years -LRB- 12 males and 20 females -RRB- , and 35 group-matched healthy participants -LRB- 13 males and 22 females -RRB- underwent volumetric magnetic resonance imaging in order to evaluate hippocampal and amygdala volumes .
17640621|No differences were noted in amygdala volumes between groups -LRB- right : p > .05 , left : p > .05 -RRB- .
17640621|No correlations between hippocampal or amygdala volumes and demographic or clinical variables were noted .
17644071|Active engagement in the amygdala and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC ; BA 47 -RRB- by unexpected but not expected cocaine infusion was discovered .
17644071|In addition , the amygdala-lateral OFC circuitry plays an important role in mediating stimulus-outcome relations and contextual factors of drug abuse .
17650397|The fMRI results showed that the bilateral amygdala , left parietal lobe , and left prefrontal lobe were activated in the normal control group , bilateral parietal lobe were activated in the AD group ; and bilateral prefrontal cortex in dAD group .
17650397|The subtraction of the results of emotion Stroop task and general word task showed the brain function area activation images as follows simple emotion factors activated the right amygdala , left parietal lobe , and bilateral prefrontal cortices and occipital lobes in the normal control group ; bilateral parietal lobes and left dorsal lateral frontal cortex in the AD group ; and bilateral prefrontal cortices in the dAD group ; CONCLUSION : With quite different brain activation pattern , the dAD patients are more susceptible to the influence of emotional factors than AD patients .
17651704|Results also revealed a repetition-suppression effect for fearful faces in the right amygdala , which arose in healthy control subjects only , suggesting a lack of amygdala modulation by fear expression in 22q11DS .
17651879|Correlates of intellectual ability with morphology of the hippocampus and amygdala in healthy adults .
17651879|Several prior imaging studies of healthy adults have correlated volumes of the hippocampus and amygdala with measures of general intelligence -LRB- IQ -RRB- , with variable results .
17651879|In this study , we assessed correlations between volumes of the hippocampus and amygdala and full-scale IQ scores -LRB- FSIQ -RRB- using a method of image analysis that permits detailed regional mapping of this correlation throughout the surface contour of these brain structures .
17651879|We delineated the hippocampus and amygdala in high-resolution magnetic resonance images of the brain from 34 healthy individuals .
17679638|Exploratory analysis using statistical parametric mapping revealed that methylphenidate also decreased -LSB- 11C -RSB- raclopride binding in hippocampus and amygdala and that these decrements were smaller in subjects with ADHD -LRB- P < .001 -RRB- .
17688985|Previous studies examining neural responses to emotional stimuli in individuals with major depressive disorder -LRB- MDD -RRB- have indicated increased responses within the left amygdala to sad faces , and increased activity within the visual cortex and striatum to expressions of happiness .
17688985|However , within the MDD group , the severity of depression correlated with the activity of the left amygdala , bilateral inferior orbitofrontal areas , and the left insula to negative pictures , whereas there were no clear indications of association between specific cerebral regions and positive pictures .
17688985|Our findings indicate that preferential decreases in the left amygdala in response to negative pictures might be involved in the processing of emotional stimuli in depressed individuals .
17688985|Also , these findings suggest that the bilateral inferior orbitofrontal cortices and left amygdala may be preferentially recruited in MDD patients , but not in healthy individuals .
17699669|Furthermore , during an effortful affective reappraisal task , nondepressed individuals showed an inverse relationship between activation in left ventrolateral PFC and the amygdala that is mediated by the ventromedial PFC -LRB- VMPFC -RRB- .
17699669|No such relationship was found for depressed individuals , who instead show a positive association between VMPFC and amygdala .
17699669|Pupil dilation data suggest that those depressed patients who expend more effort to reappraise negative stimuli are characterized by accentuated activation in the amygdala , insula , and thalamus , whereas nondepressed individuals exhibit the opposite pattern .
17699669|These findings indicate that a key feature underlying the pathophysiology of major depression is the counterproductive engagement of right prefrontal cortex and the lack of engagement of left lateral-ventromedial prefrontal circuitry important for the downregulation of amygdala responses to negative stimuli .
17715198|Only on itch , but not on heat pain , negative BOLD signals were found in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and the amygdala .
17716795|Reductions of gray matter concentration in patients to controls were observed in bilateral insula , bilateral superior temporal gyri and left amygdala .
17717191|Prolonged attenuation of amygdala-kindled seizure measures in rats by convection-enhanced delivery of the N-type calcium channel antagonists omega-conotoxin GVIA and omega-conotoxin MVIIA .
17717191|Here , we examined whether CED infusion of the N-type calcium channel antagonists omega-conotoxin GVIA -LRB- omega-CTX-G -RRB- and omega-conotoxin MVIIA -LRB- omega-CTX-M -RRB- can attenuate kindling measures in fully amygdala-kindled rats .
17717191|Rats were implanted with a combination infusion cannula-stimulating electrode assembly into the right basolateral amygdala .
17719567|However , it is not yet clear whether this bias represents 1 -RRB- impaired top-down cognitive control over affective responses , potentially linked to deficits in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex function ; or 2 -RRB- enhanced bottom-up responses to affectively laden stimuli that dysregulate cognitive control mechanisms , potentially linked to deficits in amygdala and anterior cingulate function .
17719567|RESULTS : Compared with control subjects , patients with depression showed an enhanced amygdala response to unattended fear-related stimuli -LRB- relative to unattended neutral -RRB- .
17726086|Positron emission tomography scans revealed decreased relative activity in ventromedial temporal cortex -LRB- i.e. right amygdala/entorhinal cortex -RRB- and increased relative activity in bilateral prefrontal cortex with treatment .
17727823|Additional exploratory analyses were performed on amygdala , thalamus , nucleus accumbens , ventral diencephalon , and cerebral and cerebellar cortex and white matter .
17727949|MRI showed T1 hyperintensities in the right amygdala and predominantly in the cerebellum corresponding to melanocytic cells .
17762711|Citalopram enhanced the BOLD signal response in the left posterior insula -LRB- together with nonprespecified pulvinar and visual cortex -RRB- but attenuated activation in the left amygdala to disgusted faces and right amygdala activation to fearful faces .
17762711|These results suggest that serotonin modulates low-level amygdala activation to aversive stimuli .
1777876|The results suggest that , for many patients with medically intractable epilepsy , an anterior temporal lobectomy including the amygdala may suffice to reduce their seizure frequency .
17825533|Reduced ventral anterior cingulate and amygdala volumes in medication-nave females with major depressive disorder : A voxel-based morphometric magnetic resonance imaging study .
17825533|Volumes of bilateral ventral anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- vACC -RRB- and right amygdala were significantly smaller in the MDD group than in the HC group .
17825533|These results suggest that volume reductions in vACC and amygdala in females with MDD are present at illness onset .
17826596|The amygdala , hippocampus , and bilateral inferior occipital gyrus help process familiar , unfamiliar , and famous faces .
17850462|Lard-associated changes in c-Fos -LRB- + -RRB- cell numbers were observed in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius , lateral parabrachial nucleus , central nucleus of the amygdala , ventral tegmental area , nucleus accumbens shell and the prefrontal cortex , and were associated with lower levels of triglycerides and free fatty acids .
17853295|fMRI amygdala activation during a spontaneous panic attack in a patient with panic disorder .
17853295|The panic attack was associated with a significantly increased activity in the right amygdala .
17853295|This is the first report on neuronal activation correlates of a spontaneous panic attack in a patient with panic disorder as measured by fMRI , which lends further support to a pivotal role of the amygdala in the pathogenesis of the disease .
17870235|jorge.armony@mcgill.ca The amygdala is known to be critical for the enhancement of memory for emotional , especially negative , material .
17870235|Consistent with our hypothesis , we found that the hemispheric laterality of the amygdala involvement in successful memory for emotional material was influenced not only by the sex of the subjects , as previously proposed , but also by the sex of the faces being remembered .
17870235|Namely , the left amygdala was more active for successfully remembered female fearful faces in women , whereas in men the right amygdala was more involved in memory for male fearful faces .
17870235|These results confirm the existence of sex differences in amygdala lateralization in emotional memory but also demonstrate a subtle relationship between the observer and the stimulus in this process .
17870614|Influence of attentional demands on the processing of emotional facial expressions in the amygdala .
17870614|laetitia.silvert@univ-bpclermont.fr Recent studies have cast doubts on the appealing idea that the processing of threat-related stimuli in the amygdala is unconstrained by the availability of attentional resources .
17870614|In the orientation task , ignored fearful faces led to stronger activation in the right amygdala than ignored neutral faces .
17870614|Thus , emotional processing of peripheral faces in the amygdala also appears to depend on the available perceptual attentional resources .
17877551|Effects of unilateral hippocampus-amygdala-partial temporal lobe resection on auditory EEG/MEG responses : a case study .
17877551|heikki.hamalainen@utu.fi Auditory orienting and discrimination were studied with combined multi-channel EEG and MEG recordings in a patient with unilateral amygdala-hippocampus-partial temporal lobe resection of the right hemisphere .
17877551|These results give support to the notions about the role of the amygdala and hippocampus in alerting and orienting , respectively , and of the temporal cortex in auditory discrimination .
17879610|Humans have social intelligence thought to be related to a network connected to amygdala , the orbito-frontal cortex , and the superior temporal gyrus .
17889563|For patients with MDD , this involved the medial frontal gyrus , and right insula and amygdala regions , whereas for those OCD patients without MDD , the rostral anterior cingulate cortex was involved .
17918712|The females showed activation both in the left and the right amygdala , greater in the former than in the latter -LRB- -LSB- 220.52 + / - 17.09 -RSB- mm3 vs. -LSB- 155.45 + / - 18.34 -RSB- mm3 , P < 0.05 -RRB- , but in the males only the left amygdala was activated .
17941996|Differences in activity in right frontal areas may indicate a dysfunctional PFC , which may lead to diminished extinction of conditioned fear and reduced inhibition of the amygdala .
17949901|We measured hippocampus and amygdala gray matter volumes .
17949901|There were no statistically significant differences in mean volumes for left or right amygdala .
17951077|Healthy controls activated the amygdala , piriform , anterior insular , and cingulate cortices on both sides .
17951077|Patients failed to activate the amygdala , piriform and the anterior insular cortex in the epileptogenic hemisphere .
17951077|Congruent with the activation data each seed region was in patients functionally disconnected with the contralateral amygdala + piriform + insular cortex .
17958489|Activity in the right amygdala also corresponded with memory for visual detail , although it did not relate to memory for the task performed with the item .
17958489|These data provide strong evidence that engagement of some amygdalar regions can correspond with enhanced memory for certain types of details , but does not ensure successful encoding of all contextual details .
17964741|As expected , the task elicited activation of the amygdala in both groups ; however , contrary to expectation , we found no difference between groups in this activation .
17970731|The effect of CB -LRB- 1 -RRB- receptor antagonism in the right basolateral amygdala on conditioned fear and associated analgesia in rats .
17970731|The present study investigated the effects of administration of the cannabinoid -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- CB -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- receptor antagonist SR141716A into the right basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- on expression of conditioned fear , formalin-evoked nociceptive behaviour , fear-conditioned analgesia and associated alterations in monoamine levels in discrete rat brain areas .
17976540|Significant differences in glucose uptake were found between males in long-term pair-bonds and lone males in areas including the nucleus accumbens , ventral pallidum , medial preoptic area , medial amygdala , and the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus .
17981265|The amygdala is another brain structure involved in the stress response that has important interactions with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis .
17981265|To our knowledge , no studies in animals or humans have examined the impact of exogenous corticosteroid administration on the amygdala .
17981265|We assessed amygdala volume in patients receiving chronic prescription corticosteroid therapy and control subjects with similar medical histories not receiving corticosteroids .
17981265|Correlations between amygdala volume , age , and corticosteroid dose/duration were assessed using Pearson 's correlation coefficient .
17981265|RESULTS : Compared with control subjects , corticosteroid-treated patients had significantly smaller amygdala volumes .
17981265|Right amygdala volume correlated significantly with age in control subjects and with duration of corticosteroid therapy in patients .
17981265|CONCLUSIONS : Patients receiving chronic corticosteroid therapy had smaller amygdala volumes than control subjects that correlated with duration of corticosteroid therapy .
17981265|These findings suggest that corticosteroid exposure may be associated with changes in the amygdala as well as hippocampus .
17983481|Spontaneous tics produced more decrease in signals in a number of regions including the posterior cingulate cortex and amygdala , suggesting that regions known to be involved in expectation/anticipation may have been activated for the evoked , but not spontaneous , tics .
17987064|Functional coupling of the amygdala in depressed patients treated with antidepressant medication .
17987064|The amygdala plays a central role in various aspects of affect processing and mood regulation by its rich anatomical connections to other limbic and cortical regions .
17987064|It is plausible that depressive disorders , and response to antidepressant drugs , may reflect changes in the physiological coupling between the amygdala and other components of affect-related large-scale brain systems .
17987064|We explored this hypothesis by mapping the functional coupling of right and left amygdalae in functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired from 19 patients with major depressive disorder and 19 healthy volunteers , each scanned twice -LRB- at baseline and 8 weeks later -RRB- during performance of an implicit facial affect processing task .
17987064|We found that the amygdala was positively coupled bilaterally with medial temporal and ventral occipital regions , and negatively coupled with the anterior cingulate cortex .
17987064|Antidepressant treatment was associated with significantly increased coupling between the amygdala and right frontal and cingulate cortex , striatum , and thalamus .
17987064|Treatment-related increases in functional coupling to frontal and other regions were greater for the left amygdala than for the right amygdala .
17987064|These results indicate that antidepressant drug effects can be measured in terms of altered coupling between components of cortico-limbic systems and that these effects were most clearly demonstrated by enhanced functional coupling of the left amygdala .
1798761|Embryonic rat tissue from neocortex , hippocampus , hypothalamus and amygdala was transplanted into intact rat brains in various combinations : 1 -RRB- neocortex and hypothalamus -LRB- Neo + Hyp -RRB- ; 2 -RRB- hippocampus and amygdala -LRB- Hipp + Amyg -RRB- ; 3 -RRB- neocortex and hippocampus -LRB- Neo + Hipp -RRB- ; and 4 -RRB- hypothalamus and amygdala -LRB- Hyp + Amyg -RRB- .
17988837|Hippocampus and amygdala volumes in a random community-based sample of 60-64 year olds and their relationship to cognition .
17988837|Jerome.Maller@anu.edu.au Reduced volumes of the hippocampus -LRB- HC -RRB- and amygdala -LRB- AG -RRB- are potential biomarkers for Alzheimer 's disease -LRB- AD -RRB- and other neuropsychiatric disorders .
17988837|In both sexes , right hippocampi were larger than left , while left amygdala were larger than right .
17996813|In contrast , signal changes in insula , left SII cortices and right amygdala did correlate with pain ratings and are therefore likely to encode for pain intensity .
18003631|Differences in subcortical brain volumes , including the amygdala and hippocampus , were evaluated using two-way -LRB- diagnosis , sex -RRB- univariate analyses covarying for total cerebral volume and age .
18003631|RESULTS : Youth with SZ and BPD showed no differences in amygdala and hippocampal volumes .
18003631|However , boys with SZ had smallest left amygdala and girls with BPD had the smallest left hippocampal volumes .
18003631|However , there were diagnosis-by-sex interactions in the amygdala and hippocampus , structures that are rich in sex hormone receptors .
18004139|We conducted a study with functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- in 13 healthy volunteers to test the dopaminergic modulation on amygdala response to emotional processing and to evaluate if it was the result of a direct action on amygdalar nuclei or indirect modulation via medial prefrontal cortex projecting on amygdala.A placebo-controlled crossover experimental design was used .
18004139|Amygdala activation was evaluated during a facial emotion recognition test.The statistical comparison between placebo versus levodopa situations revealed a significant reduction in activation of right amygdala during the levodopa fMRI session .
18004139|The functional connectivity analysis revealed only a change of correlated activations between right and left amygdala , and not medial prefrontal cortex , after levodopa administration .
18004139|Our results suggest that administration of levodopa to healthy volunteers impairs the amygdalar activation .
18004139|It supports the hypothesis that amygdala activation follows an inverted U-shaped curve in relation to dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- concentration .
18004139|The results of the functional connectivity seem to suggest a dopaminergic action on amygdalar nuclei rather than a modulation of medial prefrontal cortex on amygdala .

18022231|rCBF in four regions of interest -LRB- amygdala , vermis of the cerebellum , anterior cingulated cortex and thalamus -RRB- was compared with heroin versus placebo .
18022231|In the amygdala , perfusion values were 0.8 + / -0.4 and 0.5 + / -0.2 on the left , and 0.9 + / -0.4 and 0.6 + / -0.3 on the right , with diacetylmorphine and with placebo , respectively -LRB- t-test results were P = 0.044 and P = 0.033 on the left and right sides , respectively -RRB- .
18022320|Comparing patients with controls a pain related hypoactive state of the ventromedial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- BA 10/11 -RRB- and a hyperactive state of the parahippocampal gyrus , amygdala and anterior insula were found in the patient group .
18029095|Increased amygdala activation is related to heart rate during emotion processing in adolescent subjects .
18029095|An association between amygdala activation and ANS activity has been shown in adults .
18029095|Examining the interaction between the ANS and amygdala in healthy adolescents may provide information about age-related changes in the association between amygdala activation and ANS measures .
18029095|Therefore , the aim of this study was to examine the relationship between amygdala activation and heart rate in normal adolescents .
18029095|Heart rate data was collected during functional magnetic resonance imaging while subjects performed a facial expression matching task that reliably activates the amygdala .
18029095|Adolescents showed significant amygdala activation for all facial expressions relative to the shape-matching , control task .
18029095|Moreover , the degree of activation in the right amygdala for Fearful faces was significantly correlated with heart rate -LRB- Spearman 's rho = 0.55 , p = 0.018 , two-tailed -RRB- .
18029095|This study shows that amygdala activity is related to heart rate in healthy adolescents .
18029095|Furthermore , this study confirms previous adolescent studies showing amygdala activation to Fearful , Angry , and Happy faces .
18030335|Most interestingly , when volunteers were required to give an overt aesthetic judgment , the images judged as beautiful selectively activated the right amygdala , relative to those judged as ugly .
18030335|We conclude that , in observers nave to art criticism , the sense of beauty is mediated by two non-mutually exclusive processes : one based on a joint activation of sets of cortical neurons , triggered by parameters intrinsic to the stimuli , and the insula -LRB- objective beauty -RRB- ; the other based on the activation of the amygdala , driven by one 's own emotional experiences -LRB- subjective beauty -RRB- .
18035523|Ictal EEG showed rhythmic theta waves originated from the right temporal lobe , and SISCOM showed ictal hyperperfusion on right insula , amygdala , hippocampal head , and anterior temporal lobe , whereas interictal FDG-PET showed interictal hypometabolism in the same brain regions , suggesting dysfunction and abnormal activation of right temporo-limbic structures related to an emotional response to music .
18043754|At light onset , blue light , as compared to green light , increased activity in the left hippocampus , left thalamus , and right amygdala .
18043766|dannlow@uni-muenster.de OBJECTIVE : In a previous study , we demonstrated that amygdala reactivity to masked negative facial emotions predicts negative judgmental bias in healthy subjects .
18043766|In the present study , we extended the paradigm to a sample of 35 inpatients suffering from depression to investigate the effect of amygdala reactivity on automatic negative judgmental bias and clinical characteristics in depression .
18043766|RESULTS : Significant associations between -LRB- right -RRB- amygdala reactivity and automatic negative judgmental bias were replicated in our patient sample -LRB- r = -0.59 , p < 0.001 -RRB- .
18053686|All groups showed significant activation of a social cognitive network including the amygdala , fusiform face area -LRB- FFA -RRB- , superior temporal sulcus -LRB- STS -RRB- , and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- VLPFC -RRB- while completing a task of complex social cognition -LRB- i.e. trustworthiness judgments -RRB- .
18053686|ASD and P-SCZ individuals showed significantly reduced neural activation in the right amygdala , FFA , and left VLPFC as compared to controls and in the left VLPFC as compared to NP-SCZ individuals during this task .
18054901|Sexual dimorphism and steroid responsiveness of the posterodorsal medial amygdala in adult mice .
18054901|The posterodorsal aspect of the medial amygdala -LRB- MePD -RRB- is sexually dimorphic in regional volume , rostrocaudal extent , and neuronal soma size in rats .
18054971|Because the amygdala is believed to be critically implicated in memory for emotionally arousing information and because it is part of the primary olfactory area , we hypothesized that patients with a unilateral medial temporal-lobe resection including the amygdala would not show enhanced memory for arousing compared to nonarousing odors .
18054971|We tested odor memory in 19 patients -LRB- 10 left , 9 right -RRB- who had undergone a unilateral medial temporal-lobe resection including the amygdala -LRB- MTLR -RRB- for treatment of intractable epilepsy and 19 healthy control subjects .
18060062|METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS : Using functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- , we found that repeated exposure to violent media , but not to other equally arousing media , led to both diminished response in right lateral orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- right ltOFC -RRB- and a decrease in right ltOFC-amygdala interaction .
18064583|We observed opposite parametric modulation of self-relatedness and emotion dimensions in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens , whereas neural activity in subcortical regions -LRB- tectum , right amygdala , hypothalamus -RRB- was modulated by self-relatedness and emotion dimensions in the same direction .
18076082|Sexual dimorphism in neuronal number of the posterodorsal medial amygdala is independent of circulating androgens and regional volume in adult rats .
18076082|The posterodorsal medial amygdala -LRB- MePD -RRB- in rodents integrates olfactory and pheromonal information , which , coupled with the appropriate hormonal signals , may facilitate or repress reproductive behavior in adulthood .
18076995|Predictors of amygdala activation during the processing of emotional stimuli : a meta-analysis of 385 PET and fMRI studies .
18076995|s.costafreda@iop.kcl.ac.uk Although amygdala activity has been purported to be modulated by affective and non-affective factors , considerable controversy remains on its precise functional nature .
18076995|We conducted a meta-analysis of 385 functional neuroimaging studies of emotional processing , examining the effects of experimental characteristics on the probability of detecting amygdala activity .
18076995|All emotional stimuli were associated with higher probability of amygdala activity than neutral stimuli .
18076995|The level of attentional processing affected amygdala activity , as passive processing was associated with a higher probability of activation than active task instructions .
18076995|Aversive learning increased the probability of amygdala activation as well .
18076995|Methodological variables , such as type of analysis and magnet strength , were also independent predictors of amygdala activation .
18094242|Abstinence-induced cravings to smoke were predicted by CBF increases -LRB- abstinence minus satiety -RRB- in the right OFC , right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , occipital cortex , ACC , ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens , thalamus , amygdala , bilateral hippocampus , left caudate , and right insula .
18155924|The larger volume condition additionally activated left posterior amygdala , left posterior insula and the left precuneus .
18155924|The response in the left amygdala and insula was negatively associated with changes in self-reports of fullness and positively with changes in plasma ghrelin concentration , whereas those in the right amygdala and insula were negatively associated with the subject 's body mass index .
18155924|These findings provide evidence that the left amygdala and insula process interoceptive signals of fullness produced by gastric distention involved in the controls of food intake .
18158161|Sexually dimorphic changes in the amygdala in relation to delusional beliefs in first episode psychosis .
18158161|a.gibbs@iop.kcl.ac.uk BACKGROUND : Few attempts have been made to examine the relationship between amygdala abnormalities and specific symptoms in psychosis .
18158161|The present study explored the relationship between amygdala morphology and mood congruent and mood incongruent delusional beliefs .
18158161|RESULTS : Left-greater-than-right-asymmetry of the amygdala varied as a function of gender and mood congruence of delusional beliefs , due to asymmetrical enlargement of the left amygdala in women presenting with predominantly mood incongruent delusions .
18158161|However , there was no difference in amygdala volumes across groups .
18158161|Sexually dimorphic changes in the amygdala may contribute to differential phenotypic illness expression in men and women .
18181882|brendanrich@mail.nih.gov BACKGROUND : Pediatric bipolar disorder -LRB- BD -RRB- , a highly debilitating illness , is characterized by amygdala abnormalities , i.e. , volume reduction and hyperactivation during face processing .
18181882|Evidence of perturbed amygdala functional connectivity with other brain regions would implicate a distributed neural circuit in the pathophysiology of BD , and would further elucidate the neural mechanisms associated with BD face emotion misinterpretation .
18181882|Voxel-wise analyses examined whole brain functional connectivity with the left amygdala .
18181882|RESULTS : Compared to healthy subjects , BD subjects had significantly reduced connectivity between the left amygdala and two regions : right posterior cingulate/precuneus and right fusiform gyrus/parahippocampal gyrus .
18181882|CONCLUSIONS : BD youth exhibit deficient connectivity between the amygdala and temporal association cortical regions previously implicated in processing facial expressions and social stimuli .
18184777|During cued anticipation of distention , activity decreased in the insula , supragenual anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- sACC -RRB- , amygdala , and dorsal brainstem -LRB- DBS -RRB- of controls .
1822725|In descending order , the density of NFTs was as follows : periallocortex -LRB- area 28 -RRB- greater than allocortex -LRB- subiculum/CA1 zones of hippocampal formation , area 51 -RRB- greater than corticoid areas -LRB- accessory basal nucleus of amygdala , nucleus basalis of Meynert -RRB- greater than proisocortex -LRB- areas 11 , 12 , 24 , 23 , anterior insula , 38 , 35 -RRB- greater than nonprimary association cortex -LRB- 32 , 46 , superior temporal sulcus , 40 , 39 , posterior parahippocampal cortex , 37 , 36 -RRB- greater than primary sensory association cortex -LRB- 7 , 18 , 19 , 22 , 21 , 20 -RRB- greater than agranular cortex -LRB- 44-5 , 8 , 6 , 4 -RRB- greater than primary sensory cortex -LRB- 41-2 , 3-1-2 , 17 -RRB- .
18234477|Psychophysiological interactions -LRB- PPI -RRB- were tested for variations in functional connectivity between amygdala and other brain regions as a function of changes in experimental conditions -LRB- labeling versus matching -RRB- .
18234477|PPI revealed an inverse functional connectivity between prefrontal regions and the left amygdala in healthy volunteers but there was no such change in patients .
18234519|The interference of operant task performance by emotional distracters : an antagonistic relationship between the amygdala and frontoparietal cortices .
18234519|Enhanced activity in the amygdala and visual cortex was evident during trials that included positive and negative distracters .
18234519|Connectivity analysis showed that activity in right amygdala correlated with activity in cingulate gyrus , posterior cingulate , middle temporal cortex , and was negatively correlated with activity in lateral superior frontal gyrus , middle frontal/orbital gyrus , and parietal cortex .
18234519|During a task demonstrating behavioural interference in the context of emotional distracters , increased activity in neural regions implicated in emotional processing -LRB- the amygdala -RRB- was associated with reduced activity in regions thought to be involved in exerting attentional control over task-relevant sensory representations -LRB- a frontoparietal network -RRB- .
18234695|Significant FFA-amygdala and FFA-superior temporal sulcus functional connectivity was found in both the ASD and control participants .
18234695|However , the control group had significantly increased connectivity to the left amygdala and the posterior cingulate compared to ASD .
18234695|Specifically , greater social impairment was associated with reduced FFA-amygdala connectivity and increased FFA-right inferior frontal connectivity .
18249422|The amygdala has been implicated in the recognition of facial emotions , especially fearful expressions , in adults with early-onset right temporal lobe epilepsy -LRB- TLE -RRB- .
18261933|Evidence of altered cortical and amygdala activation during social decision-making in schizophrenia .
18261933|We performed region-of-interest-based analyses , which revealed that patients with schizophrenia display specific increases and reductions in activation of the medial orbitofrontal cortex , amygdala and the right insula during social decision-making , areas that play key roles in the network that underlies social decisions .
18263796|The unpleasantness of perceived dyspnea is processed in the anterior insula and amygdala .
18263796|Higher unpleasantness of dyspnea was associated with neuronal activations in the limbic system-that is , in the right anterior insula and in the right amygdala -LRB- respective Z values = 3.93 and 3.15 ; P < 0.05 -RRB- .
18263796|CONCLUSIONS : The results of the present brain imaging study suggest that the unpleasantness of subjectively perceived dyspnea is processed in the right human anterior insula and amygdala .
18266213|Neural correlates of factorial interactions between cue-factor and subject-factor were identified in the regions of the ventral tegmental area -LRB- VTA -RRB- , the left and right amygdala , the left and right fusiform cortex , and the precuneus in the mesocorticolimbic system , and in the superior frontal , dorsal lateral prefrontal , and orbitofrontal cortices in the prefrontal cortex system .
18266983|sphasis@iop.kcl.ac.uk A distributed , serotonergically innervated neural system comprising extrastriate cortex , amygdala and ventral prefrontal cortex is critical for identification of socially relevant emotive stimuli .
18266983|The extent to which a genetic variation of serotonin transporter gene 5-HTTLPR impacts functional connectivity between the amygdala and the other components of this neural system remains little examined .
18266983|To these fearful faces , S/S more than other genotype subgroups showed significantly greater positive functional connectivity between right amygdala and FG and between right FG and right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- VLPFC -RRB- .
18281017|METHODS : We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine amygdala activity and functional connectivity with the hippocampus and caudate-putamen during successful encoding -- as assessed by a recognition memory probe 1 week after scanning -- of negative , neutral , and positive pictures by 14 depressed and 12 nondepressed individuals .
18281017|The right amygdala was more active and showed greater functional connectivity with the hippocampus and caudate-putamen in depressed than in control participants during encoding of subsequently remembered negative but not neutral or positive stimuli .
18281017|The degree of memory-related right amygdala responsivity in the depressed participants was significantly correlated with depressive severity .
18284340|Both groups recruited the amygdala and the orbito-frontal cortex during the successful encoding of positive and negative information .
18289936|RESULTS : Patients with clinical depression showed areas of significantly lower current density than non-depressed patients in delta band at left anterior temporal , left midtemporal -LRB- including amygdala and hippocampus -RRB- , and both frontopolar cortices mostly on the right ; and in theta band at bilateral parietal lobe , anterior cingulate and medial frontal cortex .
18292747|A significant interaction in activation pattern between the states of hunger and satiety and stimulation with food and nonfood images was found for the left anterior cingulate cortex , the superior occipital sulcus , and in the vicinity of the right amygdala .
18294820|In the negative affect condition , relative to the neutral condition , patients with bipolar disorder demonstrated greater activation of bilateral pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and left amygdala , and less activation in right rostral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- and dorsolateral PFC at the junction of the middle frontal and inferior frontal gyri .
18294820|In the positive affect condition , there was no reduced activation of PFC or increased amygdala activation .
18294820|The pattern of reduced activation of ventrolateral PFC and greater amygdala activation in bipolar children in response to negative stimuli suggests both disinhibition of emotional reactivity in the limbic system and reduced function in PFC systems that regulate those responses .
18299209|When vocal processing gets emotional : on the role of social orientation in relevance detection by the human amygdala .
18299209|schirmer@nus.edu.sg Previous work on vocal emotional processing provided little evidence for involvement of emotional processing areas such as the amygdala or the orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- .
18299209|Processing differences between emotional and neutral vocal change in the right amygdala and the bilateral OFC were significantly correlated with the social orientation measure .
18299209|Specifically , higher social orientation scores were associated with enhanced amygdala and OFC activity to emotional as compared to neutral change .
18299209|Given the presumed role of the amygdala in the detection of emotionally relevant information , our results suggest that social orientation enhances this detection process and the activation of emotional representations mediated by the OFC .
18302230|Twelve regions were smaller in AIS , including right-sided descending white matter tracts -LRB- anterior and posterior limbs of the right internal capsule and the cerebral peduncle -RRB- and deep nucleus -LRB- caudate -RRB- , bilateral perirhinal cortices , left hippocampus and amygdala , bilateral precuneus gyri , and left middle and inferior occipital gyri .
18314269|Alexithymic features and automatic amygdala reactivity to facial emotion .
18314269|The amygdala is known to play a central role in processing emotion stimuli and in generating emotional experience .
18314269|In the present study automatic amygdala reactivity to facial emotion was investigated as a function of alexithymia -LRB- as assessed by the 20-Item Toronto Alexithymia Scale -RRB- .
18314269|The amygdala was selected as the region of interest -LRB- ROI -RRB- and voxel values of the ROI were extracted , summarized by mean and tested among the different conditions .
18314269|Masked sad and happy facial emotions led to greater right amygdala activation than masked neutral faces .
18314269|The alexithymia feature difficulties identifying feelings was negatively correlated with the neural response of the right amygdala to masked sad faces , even when controlling for depressivity and anxiety .
18314269|Reduced automatic amygdala responsivity may contribute to problems in identifying one 's emotions in everyday life .
18314269|Low spontaneous reactivity of the amygdala to sad faces could implicate less engagement in the encoding of negative emotional stimuli .
18316124|The role of the amygdala in emotional processing : a quantitative meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies .
18316124|karine.sergerie@douglas.mcgill.ca Functional neuroimaging studies have provided strong support for a critical role of the amygdala in emotional processing .
18316124|However , several controversies remain in terms of whether different factors-such as sex , valence and stimulus type-have an effect on the magnitude and lateralization of amygdala responses .
18316124|To address these issues , we conducted a meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies of visual emotional perception that reported amygdala activation .
18316124|Our results confirm that the amygdala responds to both positive and negative stimuli , with a preference for faces depicting emotional expressions .
18316124|We did not find evidence for amygdala lateralization as a function of sex or valence .
18316124|Instead , our findings provide strong support for a functional dissociation between left and right amygdala in terms of temporal dynamics .
18325670|Magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate the relation between the brain-derived neurotrophic factor -LRB- BDNF -RRB- Val66Met polymorphism and volumetric measurements for the medial temporal lobe structures -LRB- amygdala , hippocampus , and parahippocampal gyrus -RRB- and prefrontal sub-regions -LRB- the superior frontal gyrus , middle frontal gyrus , inferior frontal gyrus , ventral medial prefrontal cortex , orbitofrontal cortex , and straight gyrus -RRB- in a Japanese sample of 33 schizophrenia patients and 29 healthy subjects .
18327824|Data in the literature report a reduction in prefrontal gray matter volume , gray matter loss in the right superior temporal gyrus , amygdala volume loss , a decrease in posterior hippocampal volume , an exaggerated structural hippocampal asymmetry , and an increase in callosal white matter volume in psychopathic individuals .
18341997|Here , we show that the amygdala and mediodorsal thalamus respond preferentially to food odors that predict immediate arrival of their associated drink -LRB- FO + -RRB- compared to food odors that predict delivery of a tasteless solution -LRB- FO - -RRB- and compared to the receipt of the drink .
18341997|Moreover , since ratings of perceived pleasantness of FO + , FO - , and drink were similar , the response in the amygdala and thalamus can not reflect acquired affective value but rather predictive meaning or biological relevance .
18344175|The absolute value of valence ratings -LRB- reflecting the positive and negative extremes of valence -RRB- correlated positively with neural activity in the left dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- , dorsal anterior cingulate cortex , posterior cingulate cortex , and right dorsal PFC , and inversely with neural activity in the left medial temporal cortex and right amygdala .
18344177|The BOLD response showed a significant reduction -LRB- P = 0.001 -RRB- in the right amygdala of smokers when they viewed but did not perceive masked smoking-related stimuli , while no significant differences were found in the nonsmoker group .
18344177|More voxels in anterior cingulate cortex were negatively correlated with the amygdala during the masked smoking-related picture condition in smokers but not in nonsmokers , whereas more positively correlated voxels were observed during the masked neutral condition .
18344177|The BOLD response in drug-users indicates the amygdala responds to drug-related stimuli that are below the perceptual threshold .
18344177|The functional connectivity data suggest a functional interaction between the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex when drug users view 33 ms back-masked drug-related stimuli .
18344177|This observation suggests that the amygdala plays an important role in the indiscriminate drug-related cue process .
18345383|The volumes of the hippocampus and the amygdala of 16 panic disorder patients and 16 healthy controls measured through MV were correlated with the volumes of gray matter estimated by optimized modulated VBM .
18345383|Using a 4 mm Gaussian filter , statistically significant clusters were found bilaterally in the hippocampus and in the right amygdala in the statistical parametric map correlating with the respective manual volume .
18358627|We have previously shown that seizures induced through electrical stimulation of the corpus callosum , amygdala or hippocampus can expand the topographical expression of neocortical motor maps .
18365029|The comparison between meditation vs. rest states between experts and novices also showed increased activation in amygdala , right temporo-parietal junction -LRB- TPJ -RRB- , and right posterior superior temporal sulcus -LRB- pSTS -RRB- in response to all sounds , suggesting , greater detection of the emotional sounds , and enhanced mentation in response to emotional human vocalizations for experts than novices during meditation .
18372291|Human amygdala sensitivity to the pupil size of others .
18372291|kathryn.e.demos@dartmouth.edu Stimulation of the amygdala produces pupil dilation in animal and human subjects .
18372291|The present study examined whether the amygdala is sensitive to variations in the pupil size of others .
18372291|Results revealed that the right amygdala and left amygdala/substantia innominata were sensitive to the pupil size of others , exhibiting increased activity for faces with relatively large pupils .
18372291|These results suggest a function for the amygdala in the detection of changes in pupil size , an index of arousal and/or interest on the part of a conspecific , even in the absence of explicit knowledge .
18374900|We derived volumes of total brain and volumes of cortical and subcortical reward-related structures including the dorsolateral-prefrontal , orbitofrontal , cingulate cortices , and the insula , as well as the amygdala , hippocampus , nucleus accumbens septi -LRB- NAc -RRB- , and ventral diencephalon .
18374900|Volume reduction was most pronounced in right dorsolateral-prefrontal cortex , right anterior insula , and right NAc , as well as left amygdala .
18374900|In alcoholics , NAc and anterior insula volumes increased with length of abstinence , and total reward-network and amygdala volumes correlated positively with memory scores .
18384457|METHODS : Magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- revealed a hyperintense lesion within the right amygdala but no contrast enhancement .

18387137|The aim of our study was to determine whether a functional polymorphism of the 5-hydroxytryptamine -LRB- 1A -RRB- receptor -LRB- 5-HTR -LRB- 1A -RRB- -RRB- gene C -1019 G -LRB- identity number : rs6295 G/C -RRB- is associated with structural changes of the amygdala in patients with BPD .
18387137|Brain volumetry of the amygdala was performed with a 1.5-T Magnetom Vision apparatus -LRB- Siemens , Erlangen , Germany -RRB- and analyzed by the software program ` BRAINS ' .
18387137|Patients who have the 5-HTR -LRB- 1A -RRB- gene G allele had significantly smaller amygdala volumes than C/C genotype carriers -LRB- P = 0.02 -RRB- .
18387137|While no difference of allelic distribution between patients and controls was detected , the described effect of 5-HTR -LRB- 1A -RRB- genotype on amygdala volume was found for the whole group of patients , as well as in the subgroup of patients with comorbid major depression -LRB- P = 0.004 -RRB- but not in controls .
18387137|In contrast to these subgroups of BPD patients who had significant amygdala volume differences , the mean amygdala volume of the whole group of BPD patients was not significantly different from that of controls .
18387137|In summary , our study provides first evidence that 5-HTR -LRB- 1A -RRB- gene C -1019 G polymorphism is associated with structural changes in the limbic system of BPD patients , a finding that might be disease related and might contribute to explanation of previous discrepant results regarding amygdala volume changes in BPD .
18388730|In the sad condition , participants with the low activity allele showed greater brain activity in the left amygdala .
18388735|Aging hippocampus and amygdala .
18395424|Orbitofrontal , amygdala and hippocampal volumes in teenagers with first-presentation borderline personality disorder .
18395424|The aim of the study was to investigate orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- , hippocampal and amygdala volumes in a first-presentation teenage BPD sample with minimal exposure to treatment .
18395424|Hippocampal , amygdala , OFC and whole brain volumes were estimated and compared between the two groups .
18395424|No significant differences were found for amygdala or hippocampal volumes comparing BPD with control participants .
18395424|We identified OFC but not hippocampal or amygdala volumetric differences early in the course of BPD .
18395424|Hippocampal and amygdala volume reductions observed in adult BPD samples might develop during the course of the disorder , although longitudinal studies are needed to examine this .
18402630|A preliminary functional magnetic resonance imaging study of prefrontal-amygdalar activation changes in adolescents with bipolar depression treated with lamotrigine .
18402630|Therefore , we hypothesized that adolescents with bipolar depression successfully treated with lamotrigine would show decreases in amygdalar activation , and increases in prefrontal activation .
18402630|Activation in bilateral amygdalae and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- for negative minus neutral pictures was correlated with Children 's Depression Rating Scale -LRB- CDRS -RRB- scores .
18402630|This clinical improvement was correlated with decreased right amygdalar activation -LRB- r = 0.91 , p = 0.002 -RRB- .
18402630|At Week 8 , but not baseline , CDRS score was positively correlated with bilateral amygdalar activation -LRB- r = 0.85 , p = 0.007 -RRB- .
18402630|CONCLUSIONS : These preliminary results indicate that adolescents with BD treated with lamotrigine demonstrated less amygdalar activation when viewing negative stimuli as depressive symptoms improved .
18423575|elizabeth.osuch@lhsc.on.ca BACKGROUND : Neuroimaging studies report that individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder show abnormal responses in the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- / anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- during exposure to traumatic reminders .
18423575|RESULTS : At rest , trauma subjects showed hyperperfusion in right mPFC/ACC and hypoperfusion in right amygdala compared with control subjects .
18423575|In trauma subjects , listening to trauma scripts versus neutral scripts resulted in decreased flow in the right amygdala and left amygdala/perirhinal cortex , and symptom scores correlated negatively with right hippocampal flow changes .
18423575|Subjective disturbance during the trauma versus neutral contrast correlated positively with rCBF changes in right amygdala and left mPFC .
18423575|Functional connectivity analyses of rCBF changes during trauma versus neutral scripts demonstrated left amygdala coupling with right ACC and bilateral anterior insula , as well as coupling between the amygdala and contralateral hippocampus .
18423575|CONCLUSIONS : In recently traumatized subjects functional interactions between the amygdala , perirhinal cortex and ACC/mPFC that occur during exposure to traumatic reminders may underlie adaptive/recuperative processes .
18424180|In comparison to controls , ADHD patients as a group -LRB- irrespective of treatment status -RRB- showed a lower Ki in bilateral putamen , amygdala and dorsal midbrain .
18424180|There was a lower Ki in the left putamen , right amygdala and right dorsal midbrain in untreated patients compared to controls together with a relative higher influx in the left amygdala and right anterior cingulate cortex .
18424180|In contrast , methylphenidate treatment was associated with a significantly lower Ki in the striatum and amygdala bilaterally , and in the right dorsal midbrain .
18434160|Right-sided anterior temporal lobectomy , along with microsurgical removal of the collateral sulcus ET were performed with consequent resection of mesial temporal structures -LRB- the region of the hippocampus , parahippocampal gyrus , and amygdala -RRB- .
18434920|The main outcome measures were psychometric measures of temperament -LRB- four factors : effortful control , negative affectivity , surgency , and affiliativeness -RRB- based on the Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire-Revised , and volumetric measures of a priori brain regions of interest -LRB- anterior cingulate cortex -LSB- ACC -RSB- , orbitofrontal cortex , amygdala , and hippocampus -RRB- .
18436404|Secondly , in a voxel-based morphometric study , we obtained a significant decreased gray matter concentration in the insula -LRB- bilateral -RRB- , superior temporal gyrus -LRB- bilateral -RRB- , and amygdala -LRB- left -RRB- in patients compared to healthy subjects .
18440204|Influence of the catechol-O-methyltransferase val158met genotype on amygdala and prefrontal cortex emotional processing in panic disorder .
18440204|In response to fearful faces , increased activation in the right amygdala was observed in patients carrying at least one 158val allele .
18440204|Our data provide preliminary evidence for a role of the functional val158met COMT polymorphism in amygdala and prefrontal activation in response to emotional faces in panic disorder .
18440572|Lower ratings of arousal accompanied greater activity in the amygdala complex , cerebellum , dorsal pons , and right medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- .
18440572|Building on an empirical literature which suggests that the amygdala serves as a salience and ambiguity detector , we interpret our findings as showing that a face rated as having low arousal is more ambiguous and a face rated as having extreme valence is more personally salient .
18440572|This explains how both low arousal and extreme valence lead to greater activation of an ambiguity/salience system subserved by the amygdala , cerebellum , and dorsal pons .
18446827|Hippocampal and amygdala volumes in children and adults with childhood maltreatment-related posttraumatic stress disorder : a meta-analysis .
18446827|Additionally , the role of the amygdala in emotional response makes it a possible region for investigation in children and adults with childhood maltreatment-related PTSD .
18446827|The objectives of this study were 2-fold : -LRB- 1 -RRB- to meta-analytically determine whether hippocampal and amygdala volumes in children and adults with PTSD from childhood maltreatment differ from those in healthy controls , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- to use cross-sectional findings performed with meta-analyses as a proxy for longitudinal studies to estimate the course of hippocampal and amygdala volumes in child and adult subjects with PTSD from childhood maltreatment .
18446827|Using electronic databases , we identified articles containing hippocampal and amygdala data for children with PTSD and adults with PTSD from childhood maltreatment .
18455481|Subgroup analysis using rating-weighted predictors revealed activation of the contralateral thalamus , anterior cingulate cortex , and amygdala and a bilateral activation of S1 , S2 , and insular cortex and prefrontal cortices in allodynia-experienced subjects .
18455812|Basolateral amygdala lesions and sensitivity to reinforcer magnitude in concurrent chains schedules .
18455812|helmsc@ohsu.edu Previous studies show that the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- is required for behavior to adjust when the value of a reinforcer decreases after satiation or pairing with gastric distress .
18455837|Effects of aging on functional connectivity of the amygdala during negative evaluation : a network analysis of fMRI data .
18455837|Consistent with behavioral findings , we identified common activity in the right amygdala , but age-related differences in the functional connectivity of this region with the rest of the brain .
18455837|Compared to young adults , older adults had greater functional connectivity between the right amygdala and ventral anterior cingulate cortex , possibly reflecting increased emotional regulation .
18458208|The amygdala and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex constitute a neural circuit that is responsible for detection of threats .
18458208|OBJECTIVE : To investigate amygdala and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activation during processing of briefly presented threats in pediatric GAD .
18458208|RESULTS : When viewing masked angry faces , youth with GAD relative to comparison subjects showed greater right amygdala activation that positively correlated with anxiety disorder severity .
18458208|Moreover , in a functional connectivity -LRB- psychophysiological interaction -RRB- analysis , the right amygdala and the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex showed strong negative coupling specifically to masked angry faces .
18458208|CONCLUSIONS : Youth with GAD have hyperactivation of the amygdala to briefly presented masked threats .
18458208|The presence of threat-related negative connectivity between the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the amygdala suggests that the prefrontal cortex modulates the amygdala response to threat .
18458208|In pediatric GAD , amygdala hyperresponse occurs in the absence of a compensatory increase in modulation by the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex .
18462478|Gender , age at onset and duration of epilepsy , history of febrile convulsions , auras , right - or left-sided TLE , memory ipsilateral to seizure onset -LRB- Wada test -RRB- , hippocampal asymmetry -LRB- HA -RRB- and T2 relaxation time , amygdala , temporal lobe and hemispheral volume were tested for associations with outcome .
18462478|Subtle volume loss in amygdala , temporal lobe or hemispheres and the memory ipsilateral to the side of resection were not associated with outcome .
18465751|Lesion and functional neuroimaging studies indicate that the ventromedial prefrontal region -LRB- VMPFC -RRB- , including the orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- , anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- and medial prefrontal cortex , and the amygdala may modulate impulsivity and aggression .
18465751|We calculated the correlations between BIS scale scores and the gray matter -LRB- GM -RRB- and white matter -LRB- WM -RRB- volumes of VMPFC and amygdala .
18485422|We suggest that the neural substrates that may subserve these impairments include the ventral striatum , amygdala , and prefrontal cortices .
18485556|Hippocampus and amygdalar volumes in patients with refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder .
18485556|matmaca_p@yahoo.com Functional and structural neuroimaging studies have implicated the hippocampus-amygdala complex in the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder -LRB- OCD -RRB- , although no consensus has been established .
18485556|Volumes of the hippocampus , and amygdala were measured by magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- in a sample of 14 refractory OCD patients and 14 healthy comparison subjects .
18485556|The mean left and right hippocampal and amygdala volumes of the patients were smaller than those of the healthy controls .
18485556|OCD severity was not correlated with amygdala volumes but was related to the left hippocampus .
18485556|Duration of illness was correlated with both hippocampus and left amygdala .
18485556|Our findings suggest that hippocampus and amygdalar abnormalities can be considered in refractoriness to OCD .
18489226|Posttraumatic stress disorder in a patient with no left amygdala .
18489226|s.smith@uwinnipeg.ca Existing biological models of posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- posit that the amygdala plays a critical role in the development and expression of this disorder .
18489226|However , increasing data indicate that the amygdalae are not functionally identical , raising the possibility that the 2 amygdalae may make differential contributions to the expression of PTSD .
18489226|The authors present a unique patient who developed PTSD following a traffic accident that occurred 2 years after she had undergone removal of her left amygdala to treat pharmacologically intractable epilepsy .
18489226|The authors propose that the right amygdala is preferentially involved in several processes related to the expression of PTSD symptoms , such that the disorder can occur even in the absence of the left amygdala .
18501389|Epileptic patients with right or left anterior mesio-temporal resection -LRB- including the amygdala -RRB- , and control subjects were presented with happy musical -LRB- chosen highly stimulating -RRB- or sad excerpts -LRB- chosen to be relaxing -RRB- , that were either consonant -LRB- pleasant -RRB- or dissonant -LRB- unpleasant -RRB- .
18513926|Relationship between post-operative depression/anxiety and hippocampal/amygdala volumes in temporal lobectomy for epilepsy .
18513926|The objective of the study was to investigate the relationship between post-operative depressive/anxiety symptoms and hippocampal/amygdala volumes following anterior temporal lobectomy .
18513926|Post-operative MRI data were collected and volumetric analysis of the hippocampi -LRB- HV -RRB- and amygdala -LRB- AV -RRB- was performed .
18513926|CONCLUSION : The severity of depressive symptomatology in operated epilepsy patients correlates with the extent of hippocampal and amygdala resection ; this association appears to be more evident in left-side resections .
18518927|Association between mitochondrial DNA 10398A > G polymorphism and the volume of amygdala .
18518927|Volume of hippocampus and amygdala is reportedly associated with various mental disorders and mental functions and is regarded as an endophenotype of mental disorders .
18518927|The present study investigated the relationship between the mtDNA 10398A > G polymorphism and the volume of hippocampus and amygdala in 118 right-handed healthy subjects .
18534256|The following thirteen regions were identified by the stepwise discriminant analysis of the z-scores as significantly contributing to the differences between the sham and OBX : amygdala , cingulate cortex , caudate putamen at the level of globus pallidus , caudate putamen-lateral part , dorsal subiculum , dorsal thalamus , hypothalamus , median raphe , somatosensory cortex , substantia nigra , ventral hippocampus , ventral tegmental area and the ventral thalamus .
18534256|The pattern of changes in the rCGU following OBX does not completely correlate with the pattern of connectivity of the olfactory bulbs , however , many regions with direct connection to the olfactory bulbs -LRB- e.g. , amygdala , hypothalamus , ventral hippocampus , and ventral tegmental area -RRB- were found to be important for differentiation .
18539249|Decreased differential activity in the amygdala in response to fearful expressions in Type D personality .
18539249|In this functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- study , the focus was on the amygdala activation and we investigated whether individual differences in activity of the amygdala following presentation of emotional expressions in the face and the whole body may be systematically related to the presence of Type D -LRB- distressed -RRB- personality or to its constituting factors , Negative Affectivity -LRB- NA -RRB- and Social Inhibition -LRB- SI -RRB- .
18539249|Our results show that the observed difference in amygdala activity between fearful and neutral expressions was present in participants that did not meet the criteria for Type D personality , while this effect was absent in participants that could be classified as Type D personality .
18539249|Our correlation analyses further showed that the activation in the left amygdala elicited by fearful versus neutral bodily expressions correlated negatively with the Negative Affectivity score .
18539249|The same pattern was observed for the right amygdala for fearful facial and bodily expressions when contrasted with neutral facial and bodily expressions .
18540778|Increased amygdala fMRI activation after secretin administration .
18540778|ytodd@mclean.harvard.edu It has recently been reported that secretin activates gene expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala in rats .
18540778|To examine the neurophysiological effects of secretin on amygdalar activation in humans , the authors measured Blood Oxygen Level Dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging signal change during facial affect processing in a placebo-controlled double-blind study .
18540778|To test whether treatment was associated with distinct patterns of activation , the two conditions -LRB- Pre and Post -RRB- were subjected to a subtraction analyses in SPM99 and hypotheses regarding the activation of the left and right amygdala were tested using a region-of-interest approach .
18540778|Subtraction of treatment minus baseline activation during the fear condition yielded significant -LRB- p = .001 -RRB- activation in the right amygdala and a nonsignificant increase in activation in the left amygdala .
18540778|No significant differences were seen between the treatment conditions for the amygdala when viewing happy or neutral faces .
18540778|The presence of increased activation of the amygdala during the viewing of fearful faces is consistent with findings from animal studies and suggests a mechanism by which secretin may modulate social behavior .
18550597|Males had larger GM volumes in the left amygdala , whereas females had larger right striatal and bilateral hippocampal GM volumes than males .
18550597|Regardless of sex , amygdala and hippocampal volumes varied as a function of TS and were associated with circulating testosterone -LRB- TEST -RRB- levels .
18550763|Contextual fear conditioning in humans : cortical-hippocampal and amygdala contributions .
18550763|Consistent with animal models centrally implicating the hippocampus and amygdala in a network supporting context conditioning , CXT + compared with CXT - significantly activated right anterior hippocampus and bilateral amygdala .
18550763|The derived model indicated that medial amygdala was the source of key efferent and afferent connections including input from orbitofrontal cortex .
18559854|Fifty of them also participated in PET measurements of cerebral blood flow , used for analyses of functional connections from the right and left amygdalae .
18559854|Homosexual subjects also showed sex-atypical amygdala connections .
18559854|In HoM , as in HeW , the connections were more widespread from the left amygdala ; in HoW and HeM , on the other hand , from the right amygdala .
18559854|Furthermore , in HoM and HeW the connections were primarily displayed with the contralateral amygdala and the anterior cingulate , in HeM and HoW with the caudate , putamen , and the prefrontal cortex .
18570205|The physical risk identification task , however , resulted in stronger sustained activity in the right cuneus/precuneus and increased transient activation in bilateral amygdala .
18570207|While both groups showed activation in left and right MTL subregions , the left-handed group showed a statistically significant increase in the left hippocampus and amygdala during both encoding and recall .
18573207|Hemispheric lateralization of a molecular signal for pain modulation in the amygdala .
18573207|carrasy@morpheus.wustl.edu The extracellular signal-regulated kinase -LRB- ERK -RRB- cascade has been shown to be a key modulator of pain processing in the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- in mice .
18573207|These findings demonstrate that modulation of pain by ERK signaling in the CeA is functionally lateralized to the right hemisphere , suggesting a dominant role of the right amygdala in pain processing .
18575352|Bilateral affected structures were hippocampal cortex , amygdala , caudate nucleus , cingulate gyrus , lower temporal gyrus and somatomotor cortex .
18585468|laszloz@andromeda.rutgers.edu The basal forebrain contains several interdigitating anatomical structures , including the diagonal band of Broca , the basal nucleus of Meynert , the ventral striatum , and also cell groups underneath the globus pallidus that bridge the centromedial amygdala to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis .
18586109|In the control and BD groups , hemodynamic activity was significantly higher in the dorsomedial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices during reversal shifting , and significantly lower in the right amygdala in response to negative feedback .
18586109|The extent to which the amygdala showed less activity during negative feedback correlated inversely with the behavioral tendency to reverse after misleading feedback .
18586109|Disrupted top-down control by the prefrontal cortex of the amygdala may underlie this abnormal response to negative feedback in unipolar depression .
18586524|While bilateral amygdala , left superior temporal sulcus and right parietal areas showed stronger blood oxygen level-dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- responses during implicit processing , areas with stronger BOLD responses during explicit processing included the left inferior frontal gyrus , bilateral parietal , anterior cingulate and supplemental motor cortex .
18586524|These results are in line with an amygdala-prefrontal-cingulate network controlling different appraisal levels , and suggest a specific role of the left inferior frontal gyrus in explicit evaluation of emotional prosody .
1860039|The effect of hippocampal kindling on protein kinase C -LRB- PKC -RRB- activity and protein concentration was investigated in rat amygdala/pyriform cortex -LRB- AM/PC -RRB- and right -LRB- contralateral -RRB- and left -LRB- ipsilateral -RRB- hippocampus -LRB- HIPP -RRB- .
18603005|The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism affects amygdala activity in response to emotional stimuli : evidence from a genetic imaging study .
18603005|Carriers of the 66Met variant showed stronger amygdala activation in the right hemisphere in response to emotional stimuli compared to neutral stimuli .
18605860|Analyses using functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that psychosocial resources were associated with greater right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and less amygdala activity during a threat regulation task but were not associated with less amygdala activity during a threat sensitivity task .
18605860|Mediational analyses suggest that the relation of psychosocial resources to low cortisol reactivity was mediated by lower amygdala activity during threat regulation .
18614265|Relative to the control and depressed groups the PTSD group exhibited greater sensitivity to correctly recognised stimuli in the left amygdala/ventral striatum and right occipital cortex , and more specific sensitivity to items encoded in emotional contexts in the right precuneus , left superior frontal gyrus , and bilateral insula .
18621091|Effect of BDNF val66met polymorphism on age-related amygdala volume changes in healthy subjects .
18621091|We sought to characterize the relationship between age , BDNF and amygdala volumes among healthy volunteers .
18621091|We measured amygdala volumes in 55 healthy , right-handed volunteers who underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- and were also characterized demographically and genotyped with respect to BDNF .
18621091|Using an ANCOVA model , we found that amygdala volumes were inversely correlated with age in BDNF val66met carriers but not in non-carriers .
18621091|This is the first report of age-related BDNF val66met polymorphism effects on amygdala volume .
18633805|killgore@mclean.harvard.edu In a previous study , with adults , we demonstrated that the amygdala and anterior cingulate gyrus are differentially responsive to happy and sad faces presented subliminally .
18633805|Relative to fixation baseline , masked sad faces activated the right amygdala , whereas masked happy faces failed to activate any of the regions of interest .
18633805|When the data were compared statistically to our previous sample of adults , the adolescent group showed significantly greater activity in the right amygdala relative to the adults during the masked sad condition .
18633834|Listening to two persons walking together activated brain areas previously associated with affective states and social interaction , such as the subcallosal gyrus bilaterally , the right temporal pole , and the right amygdala .
18635342|anna.buchheim@uni-ulm.de Functional imaging studies have shown that individuals with borderline personality disorder -LRB- BPD -RRB- display prefrontal and amygdala dysfunction while viewing or listening to emotional or traumatic stimuli .
18639236|Functional connectivity analysis revealed that changes in activation in right middle insula and bilateral anterior insula were more strongly associated with amygdala activation changes in NTC than in IPV-PTSD subjects .
18639365|shaynar@yorku.ca A PET study of patients with Alzheimer 's disease -LRB- AD -RRB- engaged in a delayed match-to-sample face recognition task revealed that performance declines as a function of increasing delay , a pattern accompanied by reduced functional connectivity of prefrontal cortex but increased connectivity of the left amygdala .
18639365|Here , we characterize the changes in interactions within this amygdalar circuit across the memory delays using structural equation modeling .
18639365|The magnitude of effective connections was found to be much greater in the patients than in the controls , notably from the left amygdala to left inferior prefrontal cortex , which , in turn , influenced its right homologue .
18639365|The influence from the amygdala to the left hippocampus , in contrast , was not strong in either group .
18640279|Statistical source analysis could demonstrate putative contribution to the generation of this component in right temporal-limbic areas , encompassing hippocampal complex and amygdala , and in right insula .
18661506|For each hemisphere , normalized correlation coefficients were computed between pairs of time-course signals extracted from five regions involved in MTLE epileptogenic networks -LRB- Brodmann area 38 , amygdala , entorhinal cortex -LRB- EC -RRB- , anterior hippocampus -LRB- AntHip -RRB- , and posterior hippocampus -LRB- PostHip -RRB- -RRB- .
18667098|RESULTS : DS individuals with AD had significantly smaller corrected volumes bilaterally of the hippocampus and caudate , and right amygdala and putamen , and a significantly larger corrected volume of left peripheral cerebrospinal fluid -LRB- CSF -RRB- , compared to DS individuals without AD .
18685833|Human and animal data implicate ventral -LRB- amygdala , ventral striatum , ventrolateral prefrontal cortex insula -RRB- and dorsal -LRB- dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and posterior parietal cortex -RRB- systems in DD decisions .
18685833|Magnitude of discounting was correlated with activity in the amygdala , DLPFC , posterior cingulate cortex and PPC .
18685833|Activation of the amygdala during choice of delayed rewards was associated with a greater degree of discounting , suggesting that heavily discounting MA-dependent individuals may be more responsive to the negative salience of delayed rewards than controls .
18717711|Preoperative amygdala fMRI in temporal lobe epilepsy .
18717711|We used functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- to investigate the role of the amygdala in processing emotions in TLE and whether this may be a potential preoperative predictive marker for emotional disturbances following surgery .
18717711|RESULTS : On viewing fearful faces , healthy controls demonstrated left lateralized , while right TLE patients showed bilateral amygdala activation .
18717711|Left TLE patients had significantly reduced activation in left and right amygdalae compared to controls and right TLE patients .
18717711|In right TLE patients , left and right amygdala activation was significantly related to preoperative anxiety and depression levels , and preoperative right amygdala activation correlated significantly with postoperative change of anxiety and depression scores , characterized by greater increases in anxiety and depression in patients with greater preoperative activation .
18717711|DISCUSSION : The fearful face fMRI paradigm is a reliable method for visualizing amygdala activation in controls and patients with mesial TLE .
18717711|Activation of the right amygdala preoperatively was predictive of emotional disturbances following right ATLR .
18722550|We measured T2 relaxation time bilaterally in the hippocampus , the amygdala , and the fusiform gyrus .
18722550|Apart from raised T2 values in the ipsilateral hippocampus , we found increased T2 values in the ipsilateral amygdala .
18723260|Self-referential processing of negative stimuli within the ventral anterior cingulate gyrus and right amygdala .
18723260|Significant activity was observed in the right ventral anterior cingulate gyrus and the right amygdala in the negative-word/self-reference condition , and in the left amygdala in the positive-word/self-reference condition .
18723260|The results also suggest that the amygdala is associated with self-referential processing of both positive and negative emotional stimuli .
18726910|Partner faces also activated the insula , amygdala and thalamus .
18752396|Furthermore , in the right amygdala and the left precuneus , areas previously associated with processing of unpleasant dissonant musical sounds , there was an interaction between the experimental condition and the stimulus type .
18752404|Voice-sensitive temporal cortices , as well as the amygdala , insula , and mediodorsal thalami , reacted stronger to angry than to neutral prosody .
18756092|RESULTS : Patients and controls showed significant differences in signal dynamics between excitatory and inhibitory components of the negative feedback loop that controls emotional arousal , specifically between the right amygdala and Brodmann area 9 -LRB- BA9 -RRB- , when viewing angry facial expressions -LRB- p = 0.002 -RRB- .
18756092|While the amygdala responses were not significantly different between groups , patients showed significantly lower BA9 activation during the beginning of the response -LRB- 0.000 < or = p < or = 0.021 -RRB- and significantly higher BA9 activation towards the end of the response -LRB- 0.008 < or = p < or = 0.025 -RRB- , suggesting longer time-lags between patients ' excitatory responses and the inhibitory activation that modulates it .
18756092|CONCLUSIONS : Our results capture a significant dysregulation between the excitatory -LRB- amygdala -RRB- and inhibitory -LRB- prefrontal -RRB- limbic regions in medicated schizophrenic patients versus healthy controls .
18756965|RESULTS : The main centers affected in the NERD-H patients included the secondary somatosensory cortex -LRB- SII -RRB- , primary somatosensory cortex -LRB- S1 -RRB- , right prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- , right orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- , insular cortex , amygdala , striatum , motor cortex and its supplementary area , and cerebellum cortices , which form part of the matrix controlling emotional , autonomic modulatory responses to pain .
18766152|FDG-PET analysis of amygdalar-cortical network covariance during pre - versus post-menopausal estrogen levels : potential relevance to resting state networks , mood , and cognition .
18766152|Compare the covariance of amygdalar activity with that of the rest of the brain during pre - and post-menopausal levels of estrogen -LRB- E2 -RRB- .
18766152|Based on the distribution of cortical E2 receptors and the neocortical regions where E2 has been shown to preferentially accumulate , we predict that E2 infusion will increase covariance of amygdalar activity with that of the temporal and frontal cortices .
18766152|Analysis of covariance between whole brain and amygdalar regional cerebral glucose consumption -LRB- CMRglc -RRB- was conducted in a voxel-wise manner by means of the basic regression option in SPM2 and was applied to FDG-PET scans acquired at baseline and after a 24 hour graded E2 infusion .
18766152|Right amygdalar CMRglc showed a significant covariance with activity of three different regions of the temporal cortex during E2 infusion , but none at baseline .
18766152|In addition , right amygdalar CMRglc covaried with that of the right medial and superior frontal gyri only during E2 infusion .
18766152|CONCLUSIONS : In addition to suggesting changes in amygdalar-cortical network connectivity as a result of short-term E2 exposure , these analyses provide evidence that basic neuroendocrine research may benefit from further use of FDG-PET and other functional neuroimaging modalities for network level analyses .
18768725|In both groups , region-of-interest analysis revealed no correlation between the magnitude of amygdala or thalamus activation and the reported level of sexual arousal .
18771508|VD mothers ' brains were significantly more responsive than CSD mothers ' brains to their own baby-cry in the superior and middle temporal gyri , superior frontal gyrus , medial fusiform gyrus , superior parietal lobe , as well as regions of the caudate , thalamus , hypothalamus , amygdala and pons .
18772255|Intra-amygdala injections of CREB antisense impair inhibitory avoidance memory : role of norepinephrine and acetylcholine .
18772255|Infusions of CREB antisense into the amygdala prior to training impair memory for aversive tasks , suggesting that the antisense may interfere with CRE-mediated gene transcription and protein synthesis important for the formation of new memories within the amygdala .
18772255|However , the amygdala also appears to modulate memory formation in distributed brain sites , through mechanisms that include the release of norepinephrine and acetylcholine within the amygdala .
18772255|In the present experiment , rats received bilateral intra-amygdala infusions of CREB antisense -LRB- 2 nmol/1 microL -RRB- 6 h prior to inhibitory avoidance training .
18772255|In vivo microdialysis samples were collected from the right amygdala before , during , and following training .
18772255|In addition , CREB antisense infusions dampened the training-related release of norepinephrine , and to a lesser extent of acetylcholine , in the amygdala .
18772255|Furthermore , intra-amygdala infusions of the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist clenbuterol administered immediately after training attenuated memory impairments induced by intra-amygdala injections of CREB antisense .
18772255|These findings suggest that intra-amygdala treatment with CREB antisense may affect processes involved in modulation of memory in part through interference with norepinephrine and acetylcholine neurotransmission in the amygdala .
18775105|Six weeks later , rats were transcardially perfused with fixative and then their brains were removed for both hamotoxylin-eosine -LRB- H&E -RRB- staining for histopathology and immunohistochemistry staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein -LRB- GFAP -RRB- for astrocytic activity and GLYT1 in the cortical dysplastic region and other rostral brain regions involving epileptogenesis such as hippocampus , pyriform cortex , amygdala , thalamus and substantia nigra .

18804514|A test of the interaction between derogatory emotion and its self-directedness revealed significant activation of the amygdala .
18804514|Our findings indicate an important role of the amygdala in the processing of unpleasant emotion or self-relevance of information in the real world may also be expanded to the processing of self-directedness of unpleasant emotion in the imagined world , and thereby contribute to human higher social cognitive process .
18809502|The present research found that prejudiced attitudes of ingroup favoritism were associated with amygdala , medial and right lateral orbitofrontal cortex .
18817740|Results identified two separable pathways that together explained approximately 50 % of the reported variance in self-reported emotion : -LRB- 1 -RRB- a path through nucleus accumbens that predicted greater reappraisal success , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- a path through ventral amygdala that predicted reduced reappraisal success -LRB- i.e. , more negative emotion -RRB- .

18837865|METHODS : Eleven bipolar I depressed and 17 normal subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- while performing a task known to activate prefrontal cortex and amygdala .
18837865|Within-group contrasts demonstrated significant amygdala activation in the controls and no significant amygdala activation in the bipolar depressed subjects .
18837865|The amygdala between-group difference , however , was not significant .
18838037|Altered amygdala and hippocampus function in adolescents with hypercortisolemia : a functional magnetic resonance imaging study of Cushing syndrome .
18838037|Using functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- , we compared 12 adolescents with Cushing syndrome with 22 healthy control adolescents on amygdala and anterior hippocampus activation during an emotional faces encoding task .
18838037|Compared to healthy adolescents , patients with Cushing syndrome showed greater left amygdala and right anterior hippocampus activation during successful face encoding .
18838037|This first study of cerebral function in adolescents with chronic endogenous hypercortisolemia due to Cushing syndrome demonstrates the presence of functional alterations in amygdala and hippocampus , which are not associated with affective or memory impairments .
18838632|RESULTS : Compared with controls , patients showed significantly more decline in gray matter density of the hippocampus , anterior cingulum , left amygdala , and right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex .
18838632|CONCLUSION : This study supports findings from animal studies of neuroplastic stress-related processes that occur in the hippocampus , amygdala , dorsomedial prefrontal cortex , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , and anterior cingulum during depressive episodes .

18947837|johnbrks@me.com The corticolimbic dysregulation hypothesis of bipolar disorder suggests that depressive symptoms are related to dysregulation of components of an anterior paralimbic network -LRB- anterior cingulate , anterior temporal cortex , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , parahippocampal gyrus , and amygdala -RRB- with excessive anterior limbic activity accompanied by diminished prefrontal activity .
18947837|Resting metabolic rates in bipolar patients were significantly greater than in controls in bilateral amygdalae , bilateral parahippocampal gyri , and right anterior temporal cortex -LRB- BA 20 , 38 -RRB- ; they were significantly lower in bipolar patients than in controls in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices -LRB- BA 9 , 10 , 46 -RRB- .
18950748|jennifer.lau@psy.ox.ac.uk BACKGROUND : Associations between a functional polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene and amygdala activation have been found in healthy , depressed , and anxious adults .
18950748|This study explored these gene-brain associations in adolescents by examining predictive effects of serotonin transporter gene variants -LRB- S and L -LRB- G -RRB- allele carriers vs. L -LRB- A -RRB- allele homozygotes -RRB- and their interaction with diagnosis -LRB- healthy vs. patients -RRB- on amygdala responses to emotional faces .
18950748|RESULTS : A significant three-way genotype-by-diagnosis-by-face-emotion interaction characterized right amygdala activity while subjects monitored internal fear levels .
18950748|First , consistent with healthy adult data , healthy adolescents with at least one copy of the S or L -LRB- G -RRB- allele showed stronger amygdala responses to fearful faces than healthy adolescents without these alleles .
18950748|Second , patients with two copies of the L -LRB- A -RRB- allele exhibited greater amygdala responses to fearful faces relative to patients with S or L -LRB- G -RRB- alleles .
18950748|Third , although weaker , genotype differences on amygdala responses in patients extended to happy faces .
18950748|CONCLUSIONS : S/L -LRB- G -RRB- alleles in healthy adolescents , as in healthy adults , predict enhanced amygdala activation to fearful faces .
18950928|Compared to the less demanding task , in a global search of all gray matter , the more demanding significantly lowered blood flow -LRB- rCBF -RRB- in left IMPC , left and right insula , and right amygdala , and significantly raised blood flow in motor cortex and right precuneus .
18956636|The activation regions were present in the orbitofrontal gyrus , anterior cingulate gyrus , piriform cortex , insular gyrus , amygdala , thalamus , basal nuclei , temporal gyrus , and frontal gyrus .
18975528|Klver-Bucy -LRB- KBS -RRB- syndrome is a rare and complicated neurobehavioral syndrome in humans resulting from damage of bilateral anterior temporal portion , especially the amygdala .
18976348|Regions showing a significant negative correlation with QF included the bilateral rectus gyri -LRB- BA11 -RRB- in the orbitofrontal area , the bilateral medial frontal area -LRB- BA6 -RRB- , and the right amygdala .
18977818|The non-demented MZ co-twins showed reduced metabolism in inferior frontal , lateral temporal , parietal and medial temporal cortices as well as in the thalamus , putamen and right amygdala .
18981339|RESULTS : Subjects with MDD compared with healthy controls showed -LRB- 1 -RRB- increased activation in the right anterior insular region , dorsal anterior cingulate , and right amygdala during anticipation of painful relative to nonpainful stimuli , -LRB- 2 -RRB- increased activation in the right amygdala and decreased activation in periaqueductal gray matter and the rostral anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortices during painful stimulation relative to nonpainful stimulation , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- greater activation in the right amygdala during anticipation of pain , which was associated with greater levels of perceived helplessness .
18982530|Effective connectivity between amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex differentiates the perception of facial expressions .
18982530|We determined whether effective connectivity of amygdala with medial orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- MOFC -RRB- and lateral orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- LOFC -RRB- differentiates the perception of emotion faces in a manner consistent with the dimensional and/or categorical view .
18982530|Greater effective connectivity from left MOFC to amygdala differentiated positive and neutral expressions from negatively valenced angry , disgust , and fear expressions .
18982530|Greater effective connectivity from right LOFC to amygdala differentiated emotion expressions conducive to perceiver approach -LRB- happy , neutral , and fear -RRB- from angry expressions that elicit perceiver withdrawal .
18996489|Given the inherent differences between anger and fear , we hypothesised that anxiety would modulate the amygdala response to angry faces to a greater extent when attended .
18996489|Following previous research , we expected anxiety to show a stronger relationship with the amygdala response to unattended fearful faces .
18996489|The results showed that higher anxiety levels produced an increased right amygdala response to viewer directed angry facial expressions -LRB- versus neutral or fearful faces -RRB- only when attended .
18996489|By contrast , increased anxiety was associated with a greater left amygdala response to fearful faces -LRB- versus neutral or angry faces -RRB- in the unattended condition , with only borderline evidence for attended fear -LRB- relative to neutral -RRB- .
19001247|RESULTS : All three patients were right-handed men with nondominant TLE originating in the right amygdala .
19001247|CONCLUSION : Our findings , together with previously published data , suggest that foreign language ictal speech automatisms are more likely to occur in men with nondominant amygdala onset seizures , an observation that might reflect the sexual dimorphism observed in the right amygdala during emotional processing .
19001253|On direct comparison , subjects with prosopagnosia showed greater loss predominantly in the right amygdala , hippocampus , fusiform gyrus , and anterior temporal pole than those without prosopagnosia .
19008895|We found that healthy controls have a strong association between the 5-HTTLPR and GM volumes of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , left anterior gyrus cinguli , left amygdala as well as right hippocampus , whereas there is no such association in patients with major depression .
19013058|VBM of gray matter revealed a significant decrease of volume in the right rostral hippocampus , in the right amygdala and in the medial orbito-frontal cortex -LRB- gyrus rectus -RRB- bilaterally .
19015081|The triadic model implicates three major nodes in the regulation of motivated behavior , i.e. amygdala , medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- and striatum .
19015081|Although behavioral performance did not differ between social and nonsocial trials , BOLD signal changes during betting were significantly greater in the amygdala bilaterally and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- BA 9 -RRB- in the social condition relative to the nonsocial condition .
19015082|The role of the amygdala in implicit evaluation of emotionally neutral faces .
19015082|The amygdala is involved in the evaluation of novel stimuli , including faces .
19015082|We examined whether the amygdala is engaged during the evaluation of emotionally neutral faces along trait-specific dimensions such as trustworthiness and attractiveness or along a general valence dimension .
19015082|Using behavioral data from evaluation of faces on 14 trait dimensions and fMRI data from an implicit evaluation paradigm , we show that the extent to which the amygdala responds to variations of faces on specific dimensions is a function of the valence content of these dimensions .
19015082|Variations on dimensions with clear valence connotations -LRB- e.g. trustworthiness -RRB- engaged the amygdala more strongly than variations on dimensions with less clear valence connotations -LRB- e.g. dominance -RRB- .
19015082|In addition to the amygdala , several other regions -- right superior occipital gyrus , right middle temporal/occipital gyrus and bilateral fusiform gyri -- were involved in valence evaluation of faces .
19015082|However , the relation between these regions and face valence was accounted for by the amygdala 's response to faces .
19015082|The findings suggest that the amygdala -LRB- i -RRB- automatically evaluates novel faces along a general valence dimension ; and -LRB- ii -RRB- modulates a face responsive network of regions in occipital and temporal cortices .
19015086|aaron-boes@uiowa.edu Emerging data on the neural mechanisms of impulse control highlight brain regions involved in emotion and decision making , including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- , anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- and amygdala .
19015086|We assessed parent - and teacher-reported behavioral ratings of impulse control -LRB- motor impulsivity and non-planning behavior -RRB- in relation to vmPFC , ACC and amygdala volume , measured using structural magnetic resonance imaging and FreeSurfer .
19015094|The left amygdala knows fear : laterality in the amygdala response to fearful eyes .
19015094|The detection of threat is a role that the amygdala plays well , evidenced by its increased response to fearful faces in human neuroimaging studies .
19015094|A critical element of the fearful face is an increase in eye white area -LRB- EWA -RRB- , hypothesized to be a significant cue in activating the amygdala .
19015094|It is unknown how the amygdala differentiates between these increases in EWA and those that are specifically associated with fear .
19015094|Using functional magnetic resonance imaging , we show that the left amygdala distinguished between fearful eyes and gaze shifts despite similar EWA increases whereas the right amygdala was less discriminatory .
19015102|Although participants did not engage in explicit evaluation of the faces , the amygdala response changed as a function of face trustworthiness .
19015102|An area in the right amygdala showed a negative linear response-as the untrustworthiness of faces increased so did the amygdala response .
19015102|The response in the left amygdala was quadratic -- strongest for faces on both extremes of the trustworthiness dimension .
19019011|Baseline-maximal distension -LRB- C -LRB- 1 -RRB- - C -LRB- 4 -RRB- -RRB- yielded significant deactivations in : -LRB- i -RRB- bilateral occipital , lateral parietal and temporal cortex as well as medial parietal lobe -LRB- posterior cingulate and precuneus -RRB- and medial temporal lobe -LRB- hippocampus and amygdala -RRB- , -LRB- ii -RRB- right dorsolateral and dorso - and ventromedial PFC , -LRB- iii -RRB- left subgenual ACC and bilateral caudate head .
19019011|The right hippocampus/amygdala deactivation was specific to sham .
19019455|tomas.hajek@dal.ca BACKGROUND : The amygdala plays an important role in the regulation of emotions and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorders .
19019455|Studies of amygdala volumes in mood disorders have been conflicting , with findings of increased , decreased and unchanged amygdala volumes in patients relative to controls .
19019455|We present the largest meta-analysis of amygdala volumes in mood disorders and the first one to investigate modifying effects of clinical , demographic and methodological variables .
19019455|METHODS : We reviewed 40 magnetic resonance imaging studies investigating amygdala volumes in patients with unipolar or bipolar disorders .
19019455|RESULTS : The volumes of the left and right amygdala in bipolar -LRB- N = 215 -RRB- or unipolar -LRB- N = 409 -RRB- patients were comparable to controls .
19019455|Bipolar children and adolescents had significantly smaller left amygdala volumes relative to controls -LRB- SDM = -0.34 , 95 % CI = -0.65 ; -0.04 , z = -2.20 , p = 0.03 -RRB- , whereas bipolar adults showed a trend for left amygdala volume increases -LRB- SDM = 0.46 , 95 % CI = -0.03 ; 0.96 , z = 1.83 , p = 0.07 -RRB- .
19019455|Unipolar inpatients had significantly larger left -LRB- SDM = 0.35 , 95 % CI = 0.03 ; 0.67 , z = -2.17 , p = 0.03 -RRB- amygdala volumes than controls , with no significant amygdala volume changes in unipolar outpatients .
19019455|CONCLUSIONS : The absence of overall differences in amygdala volumes , in the presence of significant and sometimes mirror changes in patient subgroups , demonstrates marked heterogeneity among mood disorders .
19035096|The regions showing increased ALFF were distributed with center of limbic system , such as parahippocampal gyri , amygdala , hypothalamus , dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus and part of posterior insular lobe , as well as the neocortices such as primary sensorimotor cortices , occipital cortices , inferior temporal gyri , orbital gyri , and the subcortical structures of verbal brainstem and mesial cerebellum .
19035484|In contrast , increases in FA and decreases in gray matter volume were seen in the postcentral gyri , amygdalae , hippocampi , superior frontal gyri , and anterior cingulate gyri .
19047524|MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Volumetric measures of adolescents ' amygdala , hippocampus , and anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- frequency of observed maternal aggressive behavior during a mother-adolescent conflict-resolution interaction ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- adolescent depressive symptoms .
19047524|RESULTS : Boys with smaller right amygdalas reported more depressive symptoms .
19047524|Importantly , frequency of maternal aggressive behaviors moderated the associations between both the amygdala and ACC , and adolescent symptoms .
19047524|Particularly , in conditions of low levels of maternal aggressiveness , boys with larger right amygdalas , girls with smaller bilateral amygdalas , and both boys and girls with smaller left paralimbic ACC reported fewer symptoms .
19048432|Observing dynamically changing pupils activated STS and amygdala , regions engaged by non-static and salient facial features .
19048432|Discordance between observed and observer 's pupillary changes enhanced activity within bilateral anterior insula , left amygdala and anterior cingulate .
19061906|In both sexes , the contrast suffering-minus-happy humans revealed a difference in the activation of the occipito/temporal , right occipital -LRB- BA19 -RRB- , bilateral parahippocampal , left dorsal prefrontal cortex -LRB- DPFC -RRB- and left amygdala .
19061906|However , increased right amygdala and right frontal area activities were observed only in women .
19064747|RESULTS : PD patients with PG showed resting state overactivity in a right hemisphere network that included the orbitofrontal cortex , the hippocampus , the amygdala , the insula , and the ventral pallidum .
19081385|Activity within regions linked to affective processing -LRB- amygdala , medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex -RRB- predicted punishment magnitude for a range of criminal scenarios .
19085964|rjtst21@pitt.edu OBJECTIVE : The amygdalae have been a focus of mood disorder research due to their key role in processing emotional information .
19085964|In this study , we examined the morphometric basis for these functional changes in late-life depression -LRB- LLD -RRB- by analyzing both the size and shape of the amygdalae with the hypothesis that shape differences may be apparent even when overall volume differences are inconsistent .
19085964|Amygdalar size was quantified by computing total volume and amygdalar shape was quantified with a shape analysis method that we have developed .
19085964|RESULTS : No significant volumetric differences were found for either amygdala .
19085964|Nevertheless , localized regions of significant shape variation were detected for the left and right amygdalae .
19085964|CONCLUSIONS : In this LLD study , we have shown that , despite insignificant amygdalar volumetric findings , variations of amygdalar shape can be detected and localized .
19086020|Conversely , the comparison of happy versus neutral faces and sad versus neutral faces revealed valence-dependent activation in the amygdala , anterior insula cortex , and posterior midcingulate cortex .
19086332|Factors predicting treatment responsiveness are not known , although we have demonstrated that symptom improvement with the 5-HT3R antagonist alosetron is correlated with reduced amygdala activity .
19086332|Connectivity analysis revealed a positive relationship between activity in the left OFC and right amygdala .
19086332|The left OFC may fail to modulate amygdala response to visceral stimulation , thereby diminishing effectiveness of treatment .
19100810|Neurochemically , females had significantly higher levels of DA -LRB- in ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- , insular cortex and n. accumbens -RRB- and 5-HT -LRB- in vmPFC , amygdala , dorsal hippocampus and insula -RRB- than males .
19100810|In contrast , males had higher levels of the DA metabolite DOPAC or DOPAC/DA ratios than females in all five regions and higher levels of the 5-HT metabolite 5-HIAA or 5-HIAA/5-HT ratios in vmPFC , amygdala and insula , suggesting greater neurotransmitter utilization in males .
19103230|Short-term full kindling of the amygdala dissociates natural and periaqueductal gray-evoked flight behaviors of the rat .
19103230|As it regards , while the defensive behaviors produced by stimulation of dorsal periaqueductal gray matter -LRB- DPAG -RRB- resemble a panic attack , resistance to capture -LRB- RC -RRB- behaviors that ensue the kindling of the amygdala -LRB- AMY -RRB- are reminiscent of a phobic reaction .
19103294|There was no hemispheric difference in 5-HT -LRB- 1A -RRB- receptor binding in the hippocampus , amygdala , and insula .
19117274|Resolving the uncertainty reduced activity in a distributed area including the amygdala and anterior cingulate .
19117274|These results implicate the amygdala and anterior cingulate as serving a role in cost-weighted decision making .
19124693|Cannabidiol attenuated the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal in the amygdala and the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex while subjects were processing intensely fearful faces , and its suppression of the amygdalar and anterior cingulate responses was correlated with the concurrent reduction in SCR fluctuations .
19126572|In a multivariate imaging analysis it was shown that the sarcasm -LRB- and emotion recognition -RRB- deficit was dependent on a circuit involving the lateral orbitofrontal cortex , insula , amygdala and temporal pole , particularly on the right .
1913197|Loss of dendritic synapses in the medial amygdala associated with kindling .
1913197|Kindling stimulation was given in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , the septal area or the corpus callosum in the right hemisphere of adult rats .
19144740|Behavioral triggers of skin conductance responses and their neural correlates in the primate amygdala .
19144740|The amygdala plays a crucial role in evaluating the emotional significance of stimuli and in transforming the results of this evaluation into appropriate autonomic responses .
19144740|Lesion and stimulation studies suggest involvement of the amygdala in the generation of the skin conductance response -LRB- SCR -RRB- , which is an indirect measure of autonomic activity that has been associated with both emotion and attention .
19144740|We recorded skin conductance in parallel with single-unit activity from the right amygdala of two rhesus monkeys during a rewarded image viewing task and while the monkeys sat alone in a dimly lit room , drifting in and out of sleep .
19144740|This suggests that the amygdala contributes to the production or modulation of SCRs regardless of the source of sympathetic arousal .
19164119|MCI patients had increased rCBF in the left hippocampus -LRB- P < .001 -RRB- , right amygdala -LRB- P = .007 -RRB- , and rostral head of the right caudate nucleus and ventral putamen and globus pallidus -LRB- P = .003 -RRB- compared with that in control subjects .
19166948|These structures interact with brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex and the amygdalae .
19166948|This modeling strategy yielded pronounced activation in the ACC , right amygdala and thalamus .
19166948|Furthermore , our findings suggest a concerted effort of the ACC and the amygdala in the cognitive-emotional evaluation of pain .
19167503|The volumes of selected brain regions , including cortex , hippocampus , amygdala , thalamus , hypothalamus and lateral ventricles , were measured using Region-Of-Interest analysis from the MRI data and total volumes compared between the two strains .
19167503|RESULTS : GAERS had increased amygdala -LRB- right : p = 0.003 ; left p < 0.001 -RRB- , cortices -LRB- right : p = 0.006 ; left p = 0.012 -RRB- and ventricular volumes -LRB- p = 0.002 -RRB- when compared with NEC rats .
19170662|Finally , compared to HC subjects , PAD showed less activity in cortical and subcortical structures including putamen , insula , and amygdala during risk-taking decisions in the SST .
19172645|Whole brain voxelwise comparisons showed marked CBF decrease in anterior cingulate -LRB- bilateral -RRB- , caudate -LRB- bilateral -RRB- , cingulate gyrus -LRB- bilateral -RRB- , cuneus -LRB- left -RRB- , inferior frontal gyrus -LRB- left -RRB- , insula -LRB- left -RRB- , middle frontal gyrus -LRB- left -RRB- , precuneus -LRB- bilateral -RRB- , prefrontal cortex -LRB- bilateral -RRB- , and superior frontal gyrus -LRB- bilateral -RRB- in men and amygdala -LRB- bilateral -RRB- , hypothalamus -LRB- left -RRB- , hippocampus -LRB- bilateral -RRB- , and middle frontal gyrus -LRB- right -RRB- in women .
19175394|The effects of right and left amygdala kindling on the female reproductive system in rats .
19175394|Using the amygdala kindling model in rats , the present study examined the effects of seizures of limbic origin on the reproductive system .
19175394|METHODS : Female Wistar rats were kindled from the left or right basolateral amygdala to a criterion of 40 stage V seizures .
19179054|In contrast , elevated NAA and myo-inositol concentrations in the left medial temporal lobe could be associated with neuronal and glial cell changes in the amygdala .
19182175|The high-N group also displayed greater responses in the right amygdala , cerebellum , left middle frontal and bilateral parietal gyri to medium levels of fearful v. happy expressions .
19188862|Using in-vivo voltammetry , increases in extracellular dopamine release in response to predator odour and tail pinch stress were recorded bilaterally and simultaneously in either the infralimbic cortex or basolateral amygdala .
19200075|Context conditioning and extinction in humans : differential contribution of the hippocampus , amygdala and prefrontal cortex .
19200075|Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate the role of the hippocampus , amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- in a contextual conditioning and extinction paradigm provoking anxiety .
19200075|The amygdala , insula and inferior frontal cortex were differentially active during late acquisition .
19200075|Connectivity analyses revealed correlated activity between the left posterior hippocampus and dACC -LRB- BA32 -RRB- during early acquisition and the dACC , left posterior hippocampus and right amygdala during extinction .
19200075|These data are consistent with theoretical models that propose an inhibitory effect of the mPFC on the amygdala .
19211150|RESULTS : Reduced magnetization transfer ratio was observed in the TRD group relative to normal controls in the anterior cingulate , insula , caudate tail and amygdala-parahippocampal areas .
19215539|Electrical stimulation of the basolateral amygdala elicits only growth hormone secretion among six anterior pituitary hormones in the pentobarbital-anesthetized male rat .
19215539|Abstract In order to investigate the role of the basolateral amygdala on secretion of the adenohypophyseal hormones , the basolateral amygdala was electrically stimulated for 10 min through a chronically implanted electrode in the pentobarbital-anesthetized adult male rat .
19215539|Electrical stimulation of the basolateral amygdala increased plasma growth hormone , decreased plasma follicle-stimulating hormone and suppressed the increase in plasma adrenocorticotropin .
19215539|These results indicate that electrical stimulation of the basolateral amygdala in the pentobarbital-anesthetized adult male rat causes a simultaneous change in secretion of several adenohypophyseal hormones .
19218865|Hemispheric differences in amygdala contributions to response monitoring .
19218865|The amygdala detects aversive events and coordinates with the rostral anterior cingulate cortex to adapt behavior .
19218865|Both amygdalae showed increased activation during error versus correct antisaccade trials that was correlated with error-related activation in the corresponding rostral anterior cingulate cortex .
19218865|Together , activation in the right amygdala and right rostral anterior cingulate cortex predicted greater accuracy .
19218865|In contrast , the left amygdala activation predicted a higher error rate .
19218865|These findings support a role for the amygdala in response monitoring .
19218865|Consistent with proposed specializations of the right and left amygdala in aversive conditioning , we hypothesize that right amygdala-rostral anterior cingulate cortex interactions mediate learning to avoid errors , whereas left error-related amygdala activation underpins detrimental negative affect .
19219848|During tactile genital stimulation , deactivations in the right amygdala and left fusiform gyrus were found for both genders .
19224115|5-HTTLPR genotype influences amygdala volume .
19224115|hsch.gf@osnabrueck.ameos.de BACKGROUND : Functional imaging studies in healthy individuals revealed an association between 5-HTTLPR genotype and neuronal activity in the amygdala .
19224115|The aim of this study was firstly to investigate a possible overall impact of the 5-HTTLPR on amygdala volume in patients with bipolar disorder and healthy individuals and secondly to test a diagnosis specific influence of the 5-HTTLPR on amygdala volume .
19224115|METHODS : We performed a region of interest analysis of amygdala volume in 37 patients with bipolar I disorder and 37 healthy control subjects .
19224115|RESULTS : This study shows that carriers of the short allele -LRB- SL or SS -RRB- of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism exhibit a relatively increased volume of the right amygdala compared to homozygous L-allele carriers irrespective of diagnosis status .
19224115|CONCLUSIONS : The present findings are consistent with the view that the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism might modulate neuronal size or number in the amygdala .
19224115|It would be worthwhile investigating the relationship between serotonin transporter function and amygdala function and volume in further studies .
19230623|Resting state correlations of low frequency BOLD fluctuations -LRB- LFBF -RRB- in echoplanar functional magnetic resonance -LRB- fMRI -RRB- data were acquired from a priori defined regions of interests -LRB- ROIs -RRB- in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- pgACC -RRB- , dorsomedial thalamus -LRB- DMTHAL -RRB- , pallidostriatum -LRB- PST -RRB- and amygdala -LRB- AMYG -RRB- , to investigate corticolimbic functional connectivity in unmedicated BD patients in comparison to healthy subjects and MDD patients .
19232481|A continuous emotional task activates the left amygdala in healthy volunteers : -LRB- 18 -RRB- FDG PET study .
19232481|32924efe@comb.es Human amygdalar activation has been reported during facial emotion recognition -LRB- FER -RRB- studies , mostly using fast temporal resolution techniques -LRB- fMRI , H -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- 15 -RRB- O PET or MEG -RRB- .
19232481|We decided to test whether amygdala response during FER tasks could be assessed with this technique .
19232481|The first , an ET-CT contrast , showed left amygdalar activation .
19232481|In conclusion , our study reveals left amygdalar activation assessed with FDG PET , as well as other major emotion recognition-related brain areas during FER tasks .
19233298|Significant LAC-related MD increase was found in the right amygdala among female subjects only .
19233298|The current results suggest female brain vulnerability to alcohol , and a relation between subtle abnormality in the right amygdala and alcohol misuse .
19234776|The current study investigated biochemical abnormalities in the amygdala in 20 high functioning adults with autistic disorder or Asperger 's disorder and 19 typically developing adults matched on age and IQ .
19234776|Magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to measure N-acetyl aspartate -LRB- NAA -RRB- , creatine/phosphocreatine -LRB- Cre -RRB- , choline/choline containing compounds -LRB- Cho -RRB- , and Myoinositol -LRB- mI -RRB- in the right and left amygdala .
19234776|This suggests that altered metabolite levels in the amygdala may be associated with a more severe early developmental course in ASD .
19242292|RESULTS : Relative to the directed condition , the incidental condition elicited greater activation in the right amygdala and the right insula , the left middle frontal gyrus , and the left posterior cingulate cortex in patients with PBD , in contrast to the HC that showed greater activation in the right superior frontal gyrus .
19242292|CONCLUSIONS : Increased amygdala activation observed in patients with PBD elicited by incidental emotional processing relative to directed emotional processing may indicate more intense automatic emotional reactivity .
19251247|METHODS : -LSB- -LRB- 18 -RRB- F -RSB- fallypride positron emission tomography studies were performed in off-medication or never-medicated schizophrenic subjects -LRB- n = 11 , 6 men , 5 women ; mean age of 30.5 + / - 8.0 -LSB- SD -RSB- years ; 4 drug-naive -RRB- and age-matched healthy subjects -LRB- n = 11 , 5 men , 6 women , mean age of 31.6 + / - 9.2 -LSB- SD -RSB- -RRB- to examine dopamine D -LRB- 2 -RRB- receptor -LRB- DA D -LRB- 2 -RRB- r -RRB- levels in the caudate , putamen , ventral striatum , medial thalamus , posterior thalamus , substantia nigra , amygdala , temporal cortex , anterior cingulate , and hippocampus .
19255377|Common and distinct amygdala-function perturbations in depressed vs anxious adolescents .
19255377|Katja.Beesdo@tu-dresden.de CONTEXT : Few studies directly compare amygdala function in depressive and anxiety disorders .
19255377|OBJECTIVE : To compare amygdala response to varying attention and emotion conditions among adolescents with major depressive disorder -LRB- MDD -RRB- or anxiety disorders , relative to adolescents with no psychopathology .
19255377|MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Blood oxygen level-dependent signal in the amygdala , measured by means of event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging .
19255377|RESULTS : Left and right amygdala activation differed as a function of diagnosis , facial expression , and attention condition both when patients with comorbid MDD and anxiety were included and when they were excluded -LRB- group x emotion x attention interactions , P < or = .03 -RRB- .
19255377|Focusing on fearful face-viewing events , patients with anxiety and those with MDD both differed in amygdala responses from healthy participants and from each other during passive viewing .
19255377|However , both MDD and anxiety groups , relative to healthy participants , exhibited similar signs of amygdala hyperactivation to fearful faces when subjectively experienced fear was rated .
19255377|Attention modulates the degree to which common or distinct amygdala perturbations manifest in these patient groups , relative to healthy peers .
19284230|In vivo and ex vivo DT revealed markedly reduced limbic projections from the thalamus and SACC to the amygdala in the right -LRB- stroke-affected -RRB- hemisphere .
19284230|Reduced amygdalar-thalamic and amygdalar-SACC connections could be a contraindication to DBS for depression .
19297506|The severity of right temporal lobe atrophy was quantified using volumetric analysis of the whole temporal lobes , the amygdala and the hippocampus .
19297506|There was marked atrophy of the right hippocampus and right amygdala , with mean volumes reduced by 41 and 51 % , respectively -LRB- left hippocampus and amygdala volumes were reduced by 18 and 33 % , respectively -RRB- .
19300596|taylo066@mc.duke.edu BACKGROUND : The uncinate fasciculus connects limbic structures , such as the hippocampus and amygdala , with frontal regions .
19308794|Sex-related functional asymmetry of the amygdala : preliminary evidence using a case-matched lesion approach .
19308794|The amygdala is another structure that has been widely implicated in emotion processing and social decision-making , and the question arises as to whether the amygdala , in a manner akin to what has been observed for the prefrontal cortex , might have sex-related functional asymmetry in regard to social and emotional functions .
19308794|A preliminary test of this question was carried out in the current study , where we used a case-matched lesion approach and contrasted a pair of men cases and a pair of women cases , where in each pair one patient had left amygdala damage and the other had right amygdala damage .
19308794|The results provide support for the notion that there is sex-related functional asymmetry of the amygdala in regard to these functions - in the male pair , the patient with right-sided amygdala damage was impaired in these functions , and the patient with left-sided amygdala damage was not , whereas in the female pair , the opposite pattern obtained , with the left-sided woman being impaired and the right-sided woman being unimpaired .
19308794|These data provide preliminary support for the notion that sex-related functional asymmetry of the amygdala may entail functions such as social conduct , emotional processing , and decision-making , a finding that in turn could reflect -LRB- as either a cause or effect -RRB- differences in the manner in which men and women apprehend , process , and execute emotion-related information .
19321315|Disentangling the web of fear : amygdala reactivity and functional connectivity in spider and snake phobia .
19321315|Presentation of phobic as compared with non-phobic cues was associated with increased activation of the right amygdala and cerebellum as well as the left visual cortex and circumscribed frontal areas .
19321315|Furthermore , amygdala activation correlated positively with the subjective experience of distress .
19321315|Connectivity analyses of activity in the phobic state revealed increased functional couplings between voxels in the right amygdala and the periamygdaloid area , fusiform gyrus and motor cortex .
19321315|During non-phobic stimulation , prefrontal activity correlated negatively with amygdala rCBF , suggesting a phobia-related functional decoupling .
19321315|These results suggest that visually elicited phobic reactions activate object recognition areas and deactivate prefrontal areas involved in cognitive control over emotion-triggering areas like the amygdala , resulting in motor readiness to support fight or flight .
19321655|Medial prefrontal cortex 5-HT -LRB- 2A -RRB- density is correlated with amygdala reactivity , response habituation , and functional coupling .
19321655|Feedback inhibition of the amygdala via medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- is an important component in the regulation of complex emotional behaviors .
19321655|We employed a multimodal neuroimaging strategy to explore the relationship between threat-related amygdala reactivity , assessed using blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging , and mPFC 5-HT -LRB- 2A -RRB- density , assessed using -LSB- -LRB- 18 -RRB- F -RSB- altanserin positron emission tomography in 35 healthy adult volunteers .
19321655|We observed a significant inverse relationship wherein greater mPFC 5-HT -LRB- 2A -RRB- density was associated with reduced threat-related right amygdala reactivity .
19321655|Remarkably , 25-37 % of the variability in amygdala reactivity was explained by mPFC 5-HT -LRB- 2A -RRB- density .
19321655|We also observed a positive correlation between mPFC 5-HT -LRB- 2A -RRB- density and the magnitude of right amygdala habituation .
19321655|Furthermore , functional coupling between the amygdala and mPFC was positively correlated with 5-HT -LRB- 2A -RRB- density suggesting that effective integration of emotionally salient information within this corticolimbic circuitry may be modulated , at least in part , by mPFC 5-HT -LRB- 2A -RRB- .
19321655|Collectively , our results indicate that mPFC 5-HT -LRB- 2A -RRB- is strongly associated with threat-related amygdala reactivity as well as its temporal habituation and functional coupling with prefrontal regulatory regions .
19322727|Shy adults also exhibited significantly greater right amygdala activation in response to stranger faces than social adults .
19328661|Recent evidence from a functional MRI study examining visual processing of faces demonstrated abnormal activation patterns in regions including left-sided inferior frontal gyrus -LRB- IFG -RRB- and amygdala .
19328661|In addition , we compared volumes in specific regions of interest including the IFG , amygdala , caudate , and total grey and white matter and examined correlations with symptom severity .
19328661|However , there were significant positive correlations between scores on the BDD version of the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Scale -LRB- BDD-YBOCS -RRB- and volumes of the left IFG -LRB- r = 0.69 -RRB- and the right amygdala -LRB- r = 0.54 -RRB- .
19328661|These findings of correlations between BDD symptom severity and volumes of the left IFG and the right amygdala .
19335934|The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism impacts parahippocampal and amygdala volume in healthy humans : incremental support for a genetic risk factor for depression .
19335934|RESULTS : Region of interest -LRB- ROI -RRB- analyses revealed an association between the 66Met allele and smaller parahippocampal volumes and a smaller right amygdala .
19335934|CONCLUSIONS : This study demonstrates that the impact of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism is not confined to the hippocampus but also extends to the parahippocampal gyrus and the amygdala .
19336391|RESULTS : When processing facial expressions of emotions , both patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls activated the bilateral amygdala and right fusiform gyri .
19336391|When directly compared with controls , the extent of activation in bilateral amygdala , parahippocampal gyrus and fusiform gyrus , right superior frontal gyrus , and lentiform nucleus was significantly less in patients .
19336391|A relative failure to recruit the amygdala in patients occurred regardless of whether the task design was explicit or implicit , while differences in fusiform activation were evident in explicit , not implicit , tasks .
19336391|CONCLUSIONS : A marked underrecruitment of the amygdala , accompanied by a substantial limitation in activation throughout a ventral temporal-basal ganglia-prefrontal cortex `` social brain '' system may be central to the difficulties patients experience when processing facial emotion .
19336392|Here , we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine amygdala/ventral prefrontal cortex -LRB- vPFC -RRB- functional connectivity -LRB- FC -RRB- and its relation to aggression in schizophrenia .
19336392|Regions of interest were placed in the amygdala based on previously published work .
19336392|A voxelwise FC analysis was performed in which the mean time series across voxels for this bilateral amygdala seed was entered as a predictor in a multiple regression model with motion parameters and global , cerebrospinal fluid , and white matter signals as covariates .
19336392|Patients showed significant reductions in FC between amygdala and vPFC regions .
19336392|These results suggest that amygdala/vPFC FC is compromised in schizophrenia and that this compromise is associated with aggression .
19348735|Conversely , across all emotional conditions the parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala , fusiform gyrus , lingual gyrus , precuneus , inferior and middle occipital gyrus , posterior cingulated , middle temporal gyrus , inferior frontal and superior frontal gyri were activated bilaterally -LRB- p = 0.001 -RRB- .
19348735|There was a valence-specific lateralization of brain response during negative emotions processing in the left amygdala -LRB- p = 0.001 -RRB- .
19355926|Here , rTg4510 transgenic mice and their littermate controls were injected with fluorogold , a nanospecie tracer , or phosphate buffered saline -LRB- PBS -RRB- targeted to the right amygdala .
19355926|An immunofluorescent study revealed TUNEL positive cells that were heavily and extensively distributed in the periamygdalar region that overlapped with the fluorogold deposit region in rTg4510 mice , whereas control mice showed only sporadic distribution of TUNEL-positive cells .
19359446|Posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- may be associated with structural abnormalities in the amygdala .
19359446|To better characterize amygdala volume in PTSD , the authors conducted a meta-analysis comparing amygdala volumes in PTSD patients and comparison subjects .
19359446|Using electronic databases , the authors found nine studies comparing amygdala volumes in adult subjects with PTSD with amygdala volumes in comparison subjects -LRB- participants unexposed to trauma and participants exposed to trauma but without PTSD -RRB- .
19359446|Results showed no significant differences in amygdala volumes between the groups .
19359446|Within each group , the right amygdala was significantly larger than the left , indicating an asymmetrically lateralized amygdala volume that is preserved in trauma exposure and in PTSD .
19360104|Predator stress also potentiates right but not left CeA-PAG -LRB- central amygdala-PAG -RRB- transmission up to 12 days after stress .
19362152|Significant differences in ERPs to unpleasant as compared to neutral or pleasant pictures were frequently and consistently observed in recordings from various brain areas -- the mesial temporal cortex -LRB- the amygdala , the hippocampus , the temporal pole -RRB- , the lateral temporal cortex , the mesial prefrontal cortex -LRB- ACC and the medial frontal gyrus -RRB- , and the lateral prefrontal cortex .
19362707|luan@umich.edu BACKGROUND : Individuals with generalized social anxiety disorder -LRB- GSAD -RRB- exhibit exaggerated amygdala reactivity to aversive social stimuli .
19362707|These findings could be explained by microstructural abnormalities in white matter -LRB- WM -RRB- tracts that connect the amygdala and prefrontal cortex , which is known to modulate the amygdala 's response to threat .
19362707|CONCLUSIONS : These findings point to an abnormality in the uncinate fasciculus , the major WM tract connecting the frontal cortex to the amygdala and other limbic temporal regions , in GSAD , which could underlie the aberrant amygdala-prefrontal interactions resulting in dysfunctional social threat processing in this illness .
19365394|RESULTS : Viewing photographs of fattening food compared with non-food objects resulted in significantly greater activation in the brainstem ; hypothalamus ; left amygdala ; left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ; left orbitofrontal cortex ; right insular cortex ; bilateral striatum , including the nucleus accumbens , caudate nucleus , and putamen ; bilateral thalamus ; and occipital lobe .
19368654|Chronic stress score was correlated with activation of the bilateral amygdala , right posterior IC -LRB- post-IC -RRB- , left periaqueductal grey -LRB- PAG -RRB- , and right dorsal posterior cingulate gyrus -LRB- dPCC -RRB- during non-painful stimulation , and with activation of the right post-IC , right PAG , left thalamus -LRB- THA -RRB- , and right dPCC during painful distensions .
19371787|As compared with neutral actions , the perception of fear and anger behaviors elicited comparable activity increases in the left amygdala and temporal cortices as well as in the ventrolateral and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex .
19376256|Here , we identify increased 2-DG uptake for the delay group compared to the unpaired group in various areas including : the medial geniculate nuclei -LRB- MGN -RRB- , the amygdala , cingulate cortex , auditory cortex , medial dorsal thalamus , and frontal cortices .
19376256|The trace group also exhibited more increases lateralized to the right hemisphere , opposite to the side of US delivery , in various areas including : CA1 , subiculum , presubiculum , perirhinal cortex , ventral and dorsal MGN , and the basolateral and central amygdala .
19381996|The effect of unilateral amygdala removals on detecting fear from briefly presented backward-masked faces .
19381996|Previous research has shown that patients with unilateral amygdala removals have difficulties rating the intensity of fearful facial expressions .
19381996|The aim of the current study was to investigate whether patients with amygdala lesions would also be impaired at detecting fear from briefly presented , backward-masked faces .
19381996|Intriguingly , patients with amygdala damage found it more difficult to recognize fear from faces shown for unlimited durations than to detect fear from briefly presented faces .
19393039|Length of retaliation was associated with a functionally linked set of cortical and subcortical structures such as right frontal lobe , right anterior cingulate -LRB- BA 24 -RRB- , right uncus , left parietal lobe , left BA 11 , left cingulate , left BA 25 , left amygdala , left BA 30 , left BA 38 and BA 9 .
19394960|Reduced amygdala volume in newly admitted psychiatric in-patients with unipolar major depression .
19394960|Structural neuroimaging studies investigating amygdala volumes in patients suffering from major depression have yielded variable results .
19394960|Absolute amygdala volumes were significantly reduced in the patient group -LRB- by 13 % in left amygdala and 12 % in right amygdala -RRB- .
19394960|The effect of reduced amygdala volumes in patients remained significant after correction for brain volume -LRB- BV -RRB- and age .
19394960|Furthermore , amygdala volume measurements in the patient sample showed a significant inverse relationship to the number of preceding depressive episodes .
19394960|In patients , severity of disease -LRB- baseline HAMD scores -RRB- and baseline cortisol levels were not related to amygdala volume .
19394960|This study of a sample of unmedicated depressed in-patients adds to the small , yet growing , body of evidence linking untreated major depression to reduced amygdala volume .
19398536|We examined whether normative variations in maternal responses to adolescents ' positive affective behavior were associated with morphometric measures of the adolescents ' affective neural circuitry , namely the amygdala , orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- , and anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- .
19398536|In addition , boys whose mothers evidenced this pattern of behavior during the EPI had larger right amygdala volumes .
19406143|Approachability and the amygdala : insights from Williams syndrome .
19406143|Given that the amygdala has been identified as an integral component of the neural system underlying sociability , researchers have suggested that the abnormal amygdala volumes found in individuals with WS may play a role in their hypersociability .
19406143|The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between amygdala volume and hypersociability , as measured by approachability ratings , in 22 individuals with WS and 22 normal controls matched on chronological age , sex , and handedness .
19406143|We confirmed previous findings of increased amygdala volumes and higher approachability ratings of both ` positive ' and ` negative ' faces in individuals with WS .
19406143|A positive relationship between right amygdala volume and approachability ratings was found in individuals with WS , particularly ratings of ` negative ' faces .
19406143|These findings support the theory that amygdala dysfunction in WS is related to their hypersociability .
19414049|Bilateral posterior parietal , premotor and prefrontal regions along with the anterior cingulate appeared to be more activated by MATH stimuli , while READ stimuli predominantly activated bilateral medial occipito-temporal , amygdala/parahippocampal and sensorimotor cortices , and the right inferior frontal cortex .
19426163|RESULTS : Results suggest that resting state connectivity of the PCC with the perigenual anterior cingulate and the right amygdala is associated with current PTSD symptoms and that correlation with the right amygdala predicts future PTSD symptoms .
19426812|The amygdala is more activated during fearful face recognition in individuals with the s allele of 5-HTTLPR .
19426813|Specifically , we observed increased rIFC along with reduced amygdala activity when participants intentionally inhibited motor responses during the presentation of negatively-valenced stimuli , and greater inverse connectivity between these regions during motor inhibition in a PPI analysis .
19426813|Given the absence of intentional affect regulation , these results suggest that intentional inhibition of a motor response dampens the amygdala activation coincident with affective stimuli to the extent that rIFC activation is higher .
19428222|Changes in prefrontal and amygdala activity during olanzapine treatment in schizophrenia .
19428222|Earlier imaging studies in schizophrenia have reported abnormal amygdala and prefrontal cortex activity during emotion processing .
19428222|We investigated with functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- during emotion processing changes in activity of the amygdala and of prefrontal cortex in patients with schizophrenia during 8 weeks of olanzapine treatment .
19428222|Results showed a diagnosis by time interaction in left amygdala and a diagnosis by time by task interaction in right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex .
19428222|In particular , activity in left amygdala was greater in patients than in controls at the first scan during both explicit and implicit processing , while it was lower in patients at the second relative to the first scan .
19428222|These results suggest that longitudinal treatment with olanzapine may be associated with specific changes in activity of the amygdala and prefrontal cortex during emotional processing in schizophrenia .
19434621|In this same contrast , HCs exhibited greater right amygdala and posterior insula activations as well as greater thalamic deactivation than the SAP group .
19434621|Both groups exhibited anterior cingulate , dorsomedial prefrontal cortex , inferior frontal gyrus/insula , and amygdala activations as well as thalamic deactivation .
19435829|RESULTS : Before treatment , hypothyroid patients exhibited lower regional activity than control subjects in the bilateral amygdala , hippocampus , and perigenual anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , left subgenual ACC , and right posterior cingulate cortex .
19439600|Diffusion MRI was collected and a probabilistically defined tract of the uncinate fasciculus -LRB- UF -RRB- , a WM pathway connecting the amygdala to medial and orbital prefrontal cortex , was used to generate fractional anisotropy -LRB- FA -RRB- values for participants .
19446647|Regions of heightened activation included brainstem and bilateral amygdala , anterior cingulate and ventral and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- for conscious fear , and brainstem and right-sided amygdala , anterior cingulate and ventral , mPFC for nonconscious fear .
19448848|Direct comparison of the 2 groups showed that PCC / precuneus connectivity was also greater in healthy controls than in patients with PTSD in a number of areas previously associated with PTSD , including the right amygdala and the hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus .
19450794|Abnormal amygdala-prefrontal effective connectivity to happy faces differentiates bipolar from major depression .
19450794|We employed dynamic causal modeling to examine significant among-group alterations in effective connectivity -LRB- EC -RRB- between right - and left-sided neural regions supporting emotion regulation : amygdala and orbitomedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- OMPFC -RRB- .
19450794|RESULTS : During classification of happy faces , we found profound and asymmetrical differences in EC between the OMPFC and amygdala .
19450794|CONCLUSIONS : Abnormal , left-sided , top-down OMPFC-amygdala and right-sided , bottom-up , amygdala-OMPFC EC during happy labeling distinguish BD and MDD , suggesting different pathophysiological mechanisms associated with the two types of depression .
19452191|18FDG PET study of amygdalar activity during facial emotion recognition in schizophrenia .
19452191|32924efe@comb.es The role of the amygdala during facial emotion recognition -LRB- FER -RRB- tasks as well as its clinical implications in schizophrenia patients remains unclear .
19452191|We studied amygdalar response during a previously validated FER task using -LRB- 18 -RRB- -LSB- F -RSB- fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography -LRB- -LRB- 18 -RRB- FDG-PET -RRB- technique in ten right-handed healthy volunteers and 11 right-handed non acute patients with schizophrenia .
19452191|Left amygdalar hyperactivation among the schizophrenia group was shown in both emotional and control tasks when compared to healthy subjects .
19452191|The right amygdala showed no differential activation in any of the tasks .
19452191|Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia exhibit a non-task specific amygdalar hyperactivation during a continuous emotional and non-emotional task when compared to matched healthy controls .
19457047|After correcting for difference in brain volume , the institutionalised group had greater amygdala volumes , especially on the right , but no differences were observed in hippocampal volume or corpus callosum mid-sagittal area .
19457047|The left amygdala volume was also related to the time spent in institutions , with those experiencing longer periods of deprivation having a smaller left amygdala volume .
19457047|These pilot findings highlight the need for future studies to confirm the sensitivity of the amygdala to early deprivation .
19462002|In contrast , patients demonstrated a dropout of dACC and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- dmPFC -RRB- recruitment but activation of the lower limbic areas -LRB- including right amygdala -RRB- and brainstem .
19462002|CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE : This study provides evidence that stimulus order in the presentation of emotional stimuli has a markedly larger influence on the brain 's response in remitted PD than in controls , leading to abnormal responses of the dACC/dmPFC and lower limbic structures -LRB- including the amygdala -RRB- and brainstem .
19464062|BACKGROUND : Major Depressive Disorder is associated with amygdala volumetric alterations .
19464062|To date , it is still unclear -LRB- I -RRB- whether amygdala volumetric alterations constitute a state or a trait marker of MDD ; -LRB- II -RRB- what influences the direction of amygdala morphometric changes -LRB- i.e. , enlargement versus shrinkage -RRB- ; and -LRB- III -RRB- what the role of laterality is in amygdala volumetric alterations in MDD .
19464062|METHODS : We investigated amygdala volume in a sample of 31 currently depressed patients -LRB- cMDD -RRB- , 31 healthy subjects with a previous diagnosis of MDD -LRB- rMDD -RRB- and 31 healthy controls , using images obtained from a 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner .
19464062|RESULTS : We found that left amygdala volumes of rMDD subjects were significantly larger as compared to healthy controls , and tended to be larger when compared to cMDD subjects .
19464062|There was no difference in left amygdala volumes between cMDD patients and healthy controls .
19464062|Right amygdala volumes did not differ between groups .
19464062|CONCLUSIONS : Given that amygdala alterations were present only in remitted patients , we suggest that such alterations appear to be a state marker of MDD .
19464062|Left amygdala enlargement in the rMDD group may represent a neurobiological marker of vulnerability to relapse , or may reflect recovery from MDD , whereby volumetric changes have resulted from stress associated with the last depressive episode .
19480227|Evidence for metabolic hypothalamo-amygdala dysfunction in narcolepsy .
19480227|We aimed to test for metabolic changes in specific brain areas , `` regions of interest , '' thought to be involved in emotional processing , sleep regulation and pathophysiology of narcolepsy : hypothalamus , pontomesencephalic junction and both amygdalae .
19480227|Myo-Inositol -LRB- ml -RRB- / Cr was significantly lower in the right amygdala of the patients , compared to controls -LRB- P < 0.042 -RRB- .
19480227|Significant negative correlations only in the patients group were found between -LRB- total NAA -RRB- / Cr in hypothalamus and ml/Cr in the right amygdala -LRB- r = -0.89 , P < 0.001 -RRB- , between ml/Cr in hypothalamus and -LRB- total NAA -RRB- / Cr in the right amygdala -LRB- r = -63 , P < 0.05 -RRB- and between ml/Cr in the left amygdala and total NAA -RRB- / Cr in the pontomesencephalic junction -LRB- r = -0.69 , P < 0.05 -RRB- .
19480227|CONCLUSION : Our findings suggest amygdala involvement and possible hypothalamo-amygdala dysfunction in narcolepsy .
19481156|The surfaces of the left and right amygdala , hippocampus , thalamus , caudate nucleus , putamen , globus pallidus , and nucleus accumbens were assessed in 40 pairs of healthy comparison controls -LRB- CON -RRB- and their siblings -LRB- CON-SIB -RRB- and 25 pairs of patients with schizophrenia -LRB- SCZ -RRB- and their siblings -LRB- SCZ-SIB -RRB- in magnetic resonance -LRB- MR -RRB- images using large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping -LRB- LDDMM -RRB- and parallel transport techniques .
19481156|Our results revealed that asymmetries observed in CON subjects occurred in the amygdala and the anterior segment of the hippocampus with more pronounced expansion deformation in the right-sided structures -LRB- R > L asymmetry -RRB- but not in the basal ganglia and thalamus .
19481156|More specifically , exaggerations and reductions in the normative pattern of asymmetries were observed in the amygdala-hippocampus formation , basal ganglia , and thalamus .
19485743|Isolated amygdala neurocysticercosis in a patient presenting with dj vu and olfactory auras .
19485743|The authors describe a 17-year-old Hispanic boy who had a single enhancing bilobar mass in the right amygdala .
19485743|To the authors ' knowledge , this case is the first reported instance of 2 distinct mesial temporal aura semiologies associated with localized neurocysticercosis in the amygdala and successfully treated with resection .
19485743|Uniquely , the case demonstrates that both olfactory and dj vu auras can emanate from the amygdala .
19486944|The emotional arousal effects were mediated by the right amygdala .
19493626|Salivary testosterone and a trinucleotide -LRB- CAG -RRB- length polymorphism in the androgen receptor gene predict amygdala reactivity in men .
19493626|Manuck@pitt.edu In studies employing functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- , reactivity of the amygdala to threat-related sensory cues -LRB- viz. , facial displays of negative emotion -RRB- has been found to correlate positively with interindividual variability in testosterone levels of women and young men and to increase on acute administration of exogenous testosterone .
19493626|Many of the biological actions of testosterone are mediated by intracellular androgen receptors -LRB- ARs -RRB- , which exert transcriptional control of androgen-dependent genes and are expressed in various regions of the brain , including the amygdala .
19493626|Here we examined whether amygdala reactivity to threat-related facial expressions -LRB- fear , anger -RRB- differs as a function of AR CAG length variation and endogenous -LRB- salivary -RRB- testosterone in a mid-life sample of 41 healthy men -LRB- mean age = 45.6 years , range : 34-54 years ; CAG repeats , range : 19-29 -RRB- .
19493626|In partial correlations adjusted for testosterone level , reactivity in the ventral amygdala was lowest among men with largest number of CAG repeats .
19493626|Activation of dorsal amygdala , correlated positively with individual differences in salivary testosterone , also in right -LRB- r = 0.40 , p < 0.02 -RRB- and left -LRB- r = 0.32 , p < 0.05 -RRB- hemisphere , but was not affected by number of CAG repeats .
19493626|Hence , androgenic influences on threat-related reactivity in the ventral amygdala may be moderated partially by CAG length variation in the AR gene .
19493626|Because individual differences in salivary testosterone also predicted dorsal amygdala reactivity and did so independently of CAG repeats , it is suggested that androgenic influences within this anatomically distinct region may be mediated , in part , by non-genomic or AR-independent mechanisms .
19500158|Impact of the tryptophan hydroxylase 1 gene A218C polymorphism on amygdala activity in response to affective facial stimuli in patients with major depressive disorder .
19500158|Using 1.5-Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging , we investigated the possible relationship between TPH1 A218C polymorphism and amygdala response to negative facial stimuli in 26 right-handed female subjects with major depressive disorder -LRB- MDD -RRB- .
19500158|Subjects with the A allele of the TPH1 A218C polymorphism showed greater brain activity in the bilateral amygdala under the sad vs. the neutral condition compared with subjects homozygous for the C allele .
19500158|Our results suggest that the A218C polymorphism of the TPH1 gene serves as a modulator of amygdala activity in patients with MDD .
19501653|However , ACTH responders deactivated rostral mPFC -LRB- BA10 -RRB- / rostral ACC -LRB- BA32 -RRB- , whereas non-responders activated this same mPFC region , and deactivated amygdala , hippocampus , and temporal pole .
19513317|Brain MRI demonstrated a focal lesion in the right amygdala that was consistent with interictal epileptiform discharges in the right temporal region on electroencephalography -LRB- EEG -RRB- .
19513317|An anterior temporal lobectomy was performed , and the pathology investigation revealed numerous melanophages in the amygdala .
19524090|Our results revealed significant decreases in bilateral insula and left somato-motor activity during the recall of observer memories , paired with a small relative increase in right posterior amygdala activity coincident with the recall of field memories .
19526836|As to rCBF of the olfactory area , we examined left and right Z scores of hippocampus , parahippocampus , amygdala , and uncus at Talairach level 3 and the scores of the Brodmann area 28 , 34 , 35 , and 36 at Talairach level 5 .
19530218|Activity in limbic regions , including the amygdala and ventral striatum , has previously been shown to correlate with identification of emotional content in faces ; however , little work has been done describing how these signals may influence emotional face memory .
19530218|In a hypothesis-driven region of interest analysis , we found that neutral faces previously presented with a threatening affect recruited the left amygdala .
19530218|These effects of prior emotion were independent of task performance , with differences being seen in the amygdala and ventral striatum even if only incorrect trials were considered .
19545476|However , NK1 antagonism increased responses specifically during the presentation of happy facial expressions in both the rostral anterior cingulate and the right amygdala .
19545982|mampeluso@hotmail.com The amygdala participates in the detection and control of affective states , and has been proposed to be a site of dysfunction in affective disorders .
19545982|To assess amygdala processing in individuals with unipolar depression , we applied a functional MRI -LRB- fMRI -RRB- paradigm previously shown to be sensitive to amygdala function .
19545982|Voxel-level data sets were subjected to a multiple-regression analysis , and functionally defined regions of interest -LRB- ROI -RRB- , including bilateral amygdala , were analyzed with MANOVA .
19545982|Pearson correlation coefficients between amygdala activation and HAM-D score also were performed .
19545982|While both depressed and healthy groups showed increased amygdala activity when viewing emotive faces compared to geometric shapes , patients with unipolar depression showed relatively more activity than healthy subjects , particularly on the left .
19545982|Positive Pearson correlations between amygdala activation and HAM-D score were found for both left and right ROIs in the patient group .
19545982|This study provides in vivo imaging evidence to support the hypothesis of abnormal amygdala functioning in depressed individuals .
19553452|Cholinergic stimulation enhanced neural activity for successful versus unsuccessful spatial context encoding in the right hippocampus but reduced activity for successful versus unsuccessful spatial context retrieval in the right amygdala .
19560133|Both age groups activated amygdala bilaterally as well as the right hippocampus during successful encoding of the fearful faces .
19560133|Direct age comparisons revealed greater activation in right amygdala and bilateral hippocampus in the young , whereas older adults showed greater activation in the left insular and right prefrontal cortices .
19560907|Significant gray matter volume reductions were found in the bilateral dorsomedial and right ventromedial prefrontal cortices , right amygdala , anterior cingulate cortex , bilateral insular cortex , occipitotemporal gyrus and left cerebellar vermis in the patients compared with the controls .
19560907|Among these regions , the VBM revealed significant sexual dimorphism : volume reduction in the right amygdala and the bilateral insular cortex was significantly greater in the males , while reduction in the right superior temporal gyrus was greater in females .
19566756|x. Smaller amygdala is associated with anxiety in patients with panic disorder .
19566756|AIMS : Anxiety a core feature of panic disorder , is linked to function of the amygdala .
19566756|Volume alterations in the brain of patients with panic disorder have previously been reported , but there has been no report of amygdala volume association with anxiety .
19566756|METHODS : Volumes of hippocampus and amygdala were manually measured using magnetic resonance imaging obtained from 27 patients with panic disorder and 30 healthy comparison subjects .
19566756|In addition the amygdala was focused on , applying small volume correction to optimized voxel-based morphometry -LRB- VBM -RRB- .
19566756|VBM showed that structural alteration in the panic disorder group occurred on the corticomedial nuclear group within the right amygdala -LRB- coordinates -LSB- x , y , z -LRB- mm -RRB- -RSB- : -LSB- 26,-6 , -16 -RSB- , Z score = 3.92 , family-wise error-corrected P = 0.002 -RRB- .
19566756|The state anxiety was negatively correlated with the left amygdala volume in patients with panic disorder -LRB- r = -0.545 , P = 0.016 -RRB- .
19566756|CONCLUSIONS : These findings suggested that the smaller volume of the amygdala may be associated with anxiety in panic disorder .
19566756|Of note , the smaller subregion in the amygdala estimated on VBM could correspond to the corticomedial nuclear group including the central nucleus , which may play a crucial role in panic attack .
19569130|Furthermore , the anterior cingulate and prefrontal volume correlated with performance on the Continuous Performance Test while the right hippocampus and amygdala volume correlated with Visual Memory Test in the DLB group .
19573050|Increased right amygdala volume in lithium-treated patients with bipolar I disorder .
19573050|OBJECTIVE : The amygdala plays a major role in processing emotional stimuli .
19573050|Fourteen studies using structural magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- have examined the amygdala volume in paediatric and adult patients with bipolar disorder -LRB- BD -RRB- compared with healthy controls -LRB- HC -RRB- and reported inconsistent findings .
19573050|Lithium has been found to increase grey matter volume , and first evidence points towards an effect on regional brain volume such as the amygdala .
19573050|METHOD : We examined the amygdala volume of euthymic patients with BD treated with lithium -LRB- n = 15 -RRB- , without lithium -LRB- n = 24 -RRB- and HC -LRB- n = 41 -RRB- using structural MRI .
19573050|RESULTS : Patients treated with lithium exhibited in comparison to HC a larger right absolute -LRB- +17.9 % , P = 0.015 -RRB- and relative -LRB- +18 % , P = 0.017 -RRB- amygdala volume .
19573050|There was no significant difference in amygdala volume between patients without lithium treatment and HC .
19573964|Converging evidence suggests that neurological profiles of individuals with CD , compared to peers , are characterized by reduced P300 brain wave amplitude , deactivation of the anterior cingulated cortex and reduced activation in the left amygdala in response to negative stimuli , and reduced right temporal lobe volume .
19594507|Bipolar and healthy individuals did not differ in amygdala activity in response to either emotion .
19594507|In bipolar individuals , there was no significant association between medication load and abnormal activity in these regions , but a negative relationship between age of illness onset and amygdala activity in response to mild fearful faces -LRB- p = 0.007 -RRB- .
19603243|Furthermore , left hippocampal sclerosis patients showed lower connectivity than right hippocampal sclerosis patients in left middle temporal gyrus , ventral medial prefrontal cortex , and left amygdala .
19603410|Pathological amygdala activation during working memory performance : Evidence for a pathophysiological trait marker in bipolar affective disorder .
19603410|While these patterns of brain activation were completely preserved in the bipolar patients , only the patients exhibited activation of the right amygdala during the articulatory rehearsal task .
19603410|These findings indicate that the right amygdala is pathologically activated in euthymic bipolar patients during performance of a circuit-specific working memory task -LRB- articulatory rehearsal -RRB- .
19616415|First-episode patients with schizophrenia showed smaller gray matter volume in the cingulate cortex bilaterally , in the left orbitofrontal gyrus , in the right inferior frontal and superior temporal gyrus , in the right temporal pole , in the left and right hippocampus , in the left parahippocampus , left amygdala , and in the left fusiform gyrus compared to the UHR patients .

19616634|We present additional data on demographic attributes of our sample and correlations analyzed separately on left and right hemispheres of the amygdala and hippocampus .
19622684|Rachel.Yehuda@va.gov The authors aimed to examine central glucocorticoids effects by measuring relative glucose metabolic rate -LRB- rGMR -RRB- in the hippocampus , amygdala , and anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- and the relationship between amygdala and ACC activity .
19622684|Group differences in hemispheric laterality of rGMR were observed following placebo administration , reflecting lower rGMR in the right hippocampus and ventral amygdala , and higher rGMR in the left ventral amygdala in the PTSD + group compared to the PTSD - group .
19622684|The net effect of HCORT was to restore a normal inverse association between the ACC and amygdala in the PTSD + group , but disrupt this neural network in the PTSD - group .
19622684|The magnitude of improvement in working memory correlated with greater hemispheric laterality in the dorsal amygdala following HCORT in both groups .
19625541|Hemispheric lateralization of pain processing by amygdala neurons .
19625541|Recent biochemical and behavioral data suggest right-hemispheric lateralization of amygdala functions in pain .
19625541|Our previous electrophysiological studies showed pain-related neuroplasticity in the latero-capsular division of the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeLC -RRB- in the right brain hemisphere .
19625541|Under normal conditions , CeLC neurons in the left amygdala had smaller receptive fields than those in the right , but the magnitude of background and evoked activity was not significantly different .
19625541|A protein kinase A -LRB- PKA -RRB- inhibitor decreased the activity of right CeLC neurons after arthritis induction but had no effect in the left amygdala .
19625541|The results show for the first time laterality of pain-related electrophysiological activity changes in individual amygdala neurons .
19625541|Whereas both left and right amygdala neurons receive nociceptive inputs and can become sensitized in principle , a yet unknown mechanism prevents PKA activation and pain-related changes in the left amygdala .
19627640|Typically , responses in limbic regions such as the amygdala are increased while activity in cortical regulatory regions such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- is diminished .
19627640|Responses in the amygdala did not distinguish the groups .
19627640|We suggest that this increase may reflect a compensatory cortical control mechanism with the effect of limiting emotional dysregulation in limbic regions such as the amygdala .
19633214|RESULTS : Less gray matter in the high-risk group relative to controls was observed in anterior cingulate regions , left amygdala , and right insula .
19633214|Lower gray matter volumes in FES compared with controls were also found in the anterior cingulate and right insula but not the amygdala .
19633214|Subtraction analysis revealed less frontotemporal , striatal , and cerebellar gray matter in FES than the high-risk group ; the high-risk group had less gray matter in left subcallosal gyrus , left amygdala , and left inferior frontal gyrus compared with FES .
19633214|Subtraction analysis confirmed lower gray matter volumes through ventral-dorsal anterior cingulate , right insula , left amygdala and thalamus in chronic schizophrenia relative to FES .
19643146|Effects of unilateral amygdala dopamine depletion on behaviour in the elevated plus maze : role of sex , hemisphere and retesting .
19643146|The amygdala has been shown to be functionally asymmetrical in both rats and humans and its involvement in stress and emotion processing is well documented .
19643146|Given that amygdala function is importantly modulated by dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- , the present study examined the effects of left vs. right unilateral DAergic depletion targeting the basolateral amygdala in male and female rats .
19643146|Significant SexxHemisphere interactions were observed for all measures related to open arm exploration , as right amygdala DA depletion produced an anxiolytic effect in males , increasing open arm exploration , but reduced this behaviour in females .
19643146|It is suggested that the role of amygdala DA on stress-related behaviour and physiology reflects inherent differences in amygdala function dependent on both sex and hemisphere .
19657971|Additionally , regions-of-interest -LRB- ROI -RRB- analyses indicated significant positive associations in the left amygdala , and trends towards significance in the right amygdala and left insula .
19660562|Is the contribution of the amygdala to the sex - and enhancement-related effects of emotional memory time-dependent ?
19660562|Whether the sex-related lateralization of amygdala function -LRB- i.e. , the female-left/male-right effect -RRB- in the emotional enhancement of memory -LRB- EEM -RRB- is time-dependent remains unclear .
19660562|We found that the right amygdala predicted 20-min EEM , while the left amygdala predicted 24-h EEM .
19660562|The sex-related lateralization of amygdala function was not detected in either the 20-min or the 24-h EEM .
19660562|Our results further confirm and extend the idea that the amygdala exhibits a lateralized and time-dependent dissociation , occurring even in the 24-h EEM relative to the 20-min EEM .
19660562|The present and previous studies indicate that sex-related lateralization of amygdala function occurs in the 2 - to 3-week EEM , but it does not occur in the 1-week , 24-h , or less than 30-min EEM , suggesting that this effect on emotional memory may also be time-dependent .
19663654|Volumes of the hippocampus and amygdala in patients with borderline personality disorder : a meta-analysis .
19663654|The hippocampus and amygdala form part of the limbic system , which plays a central role in controlling such expressions of emotional reactivity .
19663654|There are mixed results in the literature regarding whether patients with BPD have smaller hippocampal and amygdalar volume relative to healthy controls .
19663654|To clarify the precise nature of these mixed results , we performed a meta-analysis to aggregate data on the size of the hippocampus and amygdala in patients with BPD .
19663654|A significantly smaller volume was found in both the right and left hippocampi and amygdala of patients with BPD compared to healthy controls .
19663654|These findings raise the possibility that reduced hippocampal and amygdalar volumes are biological substrates of some symptoms of BPD .
19665877|The amygdala , a core structure centrally involved in socioemotional functioning , has been implicated in the neuropathology of autism .
19665877|Volumetric analysis of the amygdala was also performed .
19665877|The results showed that children with autism exhibited intact emotion matching , while showing diminished activation of the fusiform gyrus -LRB- FG -RRB- and the amygdala .
19665877|Conversely , the autism group showed deficits in person matching amidst some FG and variable amygdala activation .
19665877|No significant between-group differences in the volume of the left or right amygdala were found .
19665877|There were associations between age , social anxiety and amygdala volume in the children with autism such that smaller volumes were generally associated with more anxiety and younger age .
19665877|In summary , the data are consistent with abnormalities in circuits involved in emotion and face processing reported in studies of older subjects with autism showing reductions in amygdala activation related to emotion processing and reduced fusiform activation involved in face processing .
19673745|However , whereas control participants showed stronger activation in the amygdala and hippocampus when viewing faces with emotional -LRB- relative to neutral -RRB- expressions , the alcoholics responded in an undifferentiated manner to all facial expressions .
19673745|In the alcoholic participants , amygdala activity was inversely correlated with an increase in lateral prefrontal activity as a function of their behavioral deficits .
19673745|Prefrontal modulation of emotional function as a compensation for the blunted amygdala activity during a socially relevant face appraisal task is in agreement with a distributed network engagement during emotional face processing .
19673745|CONCLUSIONS : Deficient activation of amygdala and hippocampus may underlie impaired processing of emotional faces associated with long-term alcoholism and may be a part of the wide array of behavioral problems including disinhibition , concurring with previously documented interpersonal difficulties in this population .
19679929|Three patients had hippocampal sclerosis and two had a benign tumour in the amygdala region .
19679929|This difference was not as marked for the two patients with lesion in the amygdala region .
19683582|Compared to normal controls , addicts showed reduced activation in right amygdala in response to the affective pictures , consistent with previous reports of blunted subjective experience for affective stimuli in addicts .
19683585|Neuroticism modulates amygdala-prefrontal connectivity in response to negative emotional facial expressions .
19683585|While evidence exists for a modulatory role of neuroticism on task induced brain activity , it is unknown how neuroticism affects brain connectivity , especially the crucial coupling between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex .
19683585|Activity and functional amygdala connectivity -LRB- psycho-physiological interaction -LSB- PPI -RSB- -RRB- related to faces of negative emotional valence -LRB- angry , fearful and sad -RRB- was compared to neutral facial expressions , while neuroticism scores were entered as a regressor .
19683585|PPI analyses revealed that right amygdala-dmPFC connectivity for angry and fearful compared to neutral faces was positively correlated with neuroticism scores .
19683585|In contrast , left amygdala-anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- connectivity for angry , fearful and sad compared to neutral faces was negatively related to neuroticism levels .
19683585|Second , in line with previous reports on ACC function , the negative correlation between amygdala-ACC connectivity and neuroticism scores might indicate that those high in neuroticism display diminished control function of the ACC over the amygdala .
19686780|Resilience against predator stress and dendritic morphology of amygdala neurons .
19686780|The amygdala was studied because it modulates fear and its function is affected by stress .
19686780|Moreover , stress-induced plasticity of the amygdala has been related to induction of anxiety , a comorbid symptom of psychiatric conditions like PTSD .
19686780|Subsequently we investigated if well-adapted -LRB- less anxious -RRB- and mal-adapted -LRB- extremely anxious -RRB- stressed animals differed in the structure of dendritic trees of their output neurons of the right basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- .
19689504|x. Genetic variation in the G72 -LRB- DAOA -RRB- gene affects temporal lobe and amygdala structure in subjects affected by bipolar disorder .
19689504|We hypothesised that reductions in temporal lobe and amygdala gray matter would be associated with variation at two loci in the gene for which evidence of genetic linkage has been repeatedly demonstrated .
19689504|METHODS : We examined the temporal lobe and amygdala gray matter associations of the risk variants M23 and M24 at the 5 ' end of the gene encoding G72 in 81 controls and 38 people with bipolar disorder .
19689504|M23 was also associated with reductions in right amygdala gray matter density .
19689504|CONCLUSIONS : Genetic variation at single nucleotide polymorphisms in the G72 gene previously associated with bipolar disorder is related to reductions in temporal pole and amygdala gray matter structure in people with bipolar disorder .
19695961|Here we report about the unique seizure symptom of transformation towards the opposite gender in a patient with a right amygdalar tumor , which we classify as ictal delusional misidentification syndrome .
19720500|Lack of laterality in the effects of right and left amygdala kindling on weight gain in female rats .
19720500|A similar phenomenon is seen in female rats that are kindled from the amygdala .
19720500|Interestingly , it has been reported that kindling of the left amygdala causes more weight gain than kindling of the right amygdala .
19720500|METHODS : Female Wistar rats were kindled from the left or right basolateral amygdala to a criterion of 40 stage 5 seizures .
19726029|The amygdala has long been a site of intense interest in the search for neuropathology in autism , given its role in emotional and social behavior .
19726029|An interesting hypothesis has emerged that the amygdala undergoes an abnormal developmental trajectory with a period of early overgrowth in autism ; however this finding has not been well established at young ages nor analyzed with boys and girls independently .
19726029|METHODS : We measured amygdala volumes on magnetic resonance imaging scans from 89 toddlers at 1-5 years of age -LRB- mean = 3 years -RRB- .
19726029|RESULTS : Toddlers who later received a confirmed autism diagnosis -LRB- 32 boys , 9 girls -RRB- had a larger right -LRB- p < .01 -RRB- and left -LRB- p < .05 -RRB- amygdala compared with typically developing toddlers -LRB- 28 boys , 11 girls -RRB- with and without covarying for total cerebral volume .
19726029|Strikingly , girls differed more robustly from typical in amygdala volume , whereas boys accounted for the significant relationship of amygdala size with severity of clinical impairment .
19726029|CONCLUSIONS : This study provides evidence that the amygdala is enlarged in young children with autism ; the overgrowth must begin before 3 years of age and is associated with the severity of clinical impairments .
19732477|We predicted that people with intellectual impairment and schizotypal features would exhibit amygdala volume reduction as one of the neuroanatomical abnormalities associated with schizophrenia .
19732477|Amygdala volume was compared in these three groups and the relationship between symptomatology and amygdala volume investigated .
19732477|RESULTS : Right amygdala volume was significantly increased in the elevated risk group compared with the intellectually impaired controls -LRB- p = 0.05 -RRB- .
19732477|A significant negative correlation was seen between left amygdala volume and severity of negative symptoms within this group -LRB- p < 0.05 -RRB- , but not in either control group .
19732477|Within this population reduced amygdala volume may be associated with negative-type symptoms and be part of an extended phenotype that reflects particularly elevated risk and/or early manifestations of the development of psychosis .
19735293|The orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- and the amygdala are critical structures subserving these functions .
19735293|We used the Iowa Gambling Task -LRB- IGT -RRB- and the Ekman 60 faces test which are sensitive to the integrity of OFC and amygdala dysfunctions in 24 early PD patients and 24 controls .
19735293|Group analysis using voxel-based morphometry -LRB- VBM -RRB- showed significant and corrected -LRB- P < 0.05 FEW-small volume correction -RRB- gray matter -LRB- GM -RRB- loss in the right amygdala and bilaterally in the OFC in PD patients .
19735293|We conclude that : -LRB- i -RRB- impairment in decision-making and recognition of facial emotions occurs at the early stages of PD , -LRB- ii -RRB- these neuropsychological deficits are accompanied by degeneration of OFC and amygdala , and -LRB- iii -RRB- bilateral OFC reductions are associated with impaired recognition of emotions , and GM volume loss in left lateral OFC is related to decision-making impairment in PD .
19736355|Localization of deformations within the amygdala in individuals with psychopathy .
19736355|yaling.yang@loni.ucla.edu CONTEXT : Despite the repeated findings of impaired fear conditioning and affective recognition in psychopathic individuals , there has been a paucity of brain imaging research on the amygdala and no evidence suggesting which regions within the amygdala may be structurally compromised in individuals with psychopathy .
19736355|OBJECTIVE : To detect global and regional anatomical abnormalities in the amygdala in individuals with psychopathy .
19736355|RESULTS : Individuals with psychopathy showed significant bilateral volume reductions in the amygdala compared with controls -LRB- left , 17.1 % ; right , 18.9 % -RRB- .
19736355|Surface deformations were localized in regions in the approximate vicinity of the basolateral , lateral , cortical , and central nuclei of the amygdala .
19736355|Significant correlations were found between reduced amygdala volumes and increased total and facet psychopathy scores , with correlations strongest for the affective and interpersonal facets of psychopathy .
19736355|CONCLUSIONS : Results provide the first evidence , to our knowledge , of focal amygdala abnormalities in psychopathic individuals and corroborate findings from previous lesion studies .
19736355|Findings support prior hypotheses of amygdala deficits in individuals with psychopathy and indicate that amygdala abnormalities contribute to emotional and behavioral symptoms of psychopathy .
19739247|Maturation of the hippocampal formation and amygdala in Macaca mulatta : a volumetric magnetic resonance imaging study .
19739247|cpayne2@emory.edu Malformations of the hippocampal formation and amygdala have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders ; yet relatively little is known about their normal structural development .
19739247|The purpose of this study was to characterize the early developmental trajectories of the hippocampus and amygdala in the rhesus macaques -LRB- Macaca mulatta -RRB- using noninvasive MRI techniques .
19739247|The amygdala increased 86.49 % in males and 72.94 % in females with males exhibiting a larger right than left amygdala .
19739247|For both structures , the most substantial volumetric increases were seen within the first month , but the hippocampal formation appeared to develop more slowly than the amygdala with the rate of hippocampal maturation stabilizing around 11 months and that of amygdala maturation stabilizing around 8 months .
19739247|Differences in volumetric developmental trajectories of the hippocampal formation and amygdala largely mirror differences in the timing of the functional development of these structures .
19742050|Neuroimaging research on the neurobiology of chronic PTSD -LRB- posttraumatic stress disorder -RRB- has revealed structural and functional alterations primarily affecting areas of the medial temporal lobe -LRB- hippocampus , amygdala , and parahippocampal gyrus -RRB- and the frontal cortex known to be associated with the disorder .
19742050|When confronted with traumatic -LRB- relative to negatively valenced non-traumatic -RRB- memory , the PTSD patient exhibited evidence for increased neural activity in the right and the left superior temporal lobe , the amygdala , the left angular gyrus , and the medial frontal gyrus , while the non-PTSD patient exposed to identical conditions showed increased activations in frontal and parietal regions .
19748075|Automatic mood-congruent amygdala responses to masked facial expressions in major depression .
19748075|METHODS : In 30 acutely depressed inpatients and 26 healthy control subjects , automatic amygdala responses to happy and sad facial expressions were assessed by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- at 3 Tesla .
19748075|A robust emotion by group interaction was observed in the right amygdala .
19748075|Furthermore , amygdala responsiveness to happy facial expression was negatively correlated with current depression severity .
19748075|CONCLUSIONS : Depressed patients exhibit potentiated amygdala reactivity to masked negative stimuli along with a reduced responsiveness to masked positive stimuli compared with healthy individuals .
19748075|Thus , depression is characterized by mood-congruent processing of emotional stimuli in the amygdala already at an automatic level of processing .
19748516|A subgroup analysis compared the performance of patients affected by MRI-verified abnormalities of the hippocampus or amygdala .
19748516|Patients with hippocampus abnormality and patients with amygdala abnormality showed comparable deficits .
19763994|The amount of destroyed neural tissue is extensive and includes bilateral damage to core limbic and paralimbic regions , including the hippocampus , amygdala , parahippocampal gyrus , temporal poles , orbitofrontal cortex , basal forebrain , anterior cingulate cortex , and insular cortex .
19769471|RESULTS : There were significant decreases -LRB- p < 0.05 -RRB- between the pre - and postprogram baseline scans in the right amygdala , dorsal medial cortex , and sensorimotor area .
19776221|Stress reduction correlates with structural changes in the amygdala .
19776221|Neurobiological studies have implicated the amygdala as a brain structure crucial in stress responses .
19776221|Whereas hyperactive amygdala function is often observed during stress conditions , cross-sectional reports of differences in gray matter structure have been less consistent .
19776221|We conducted a longitudinal MRI study to investigate the relationship between changes in perceived stress with changes in amygdala gray matter density following a stress-reduction intervention .
19776221|PSS change was used as the predictive regressor for changes in gray matter density within the bilateral amygdalae .
19776221|Reductions in perceived stress correlated positively with decreases in right basolateral amygdala gray matter density .
19793982|Consistent with defense systems models , postencounter threat elicited activity in forebrain areas , including subgenual anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- sgACC -RRB- , hippocampus , and amygdala .
19793982|During the circa-strike condition , subjects showed increased coupling between the midbrain and mid-dorsal ACC and decreased coupling with the sgACC , amygdala , and hippocampus .
19793982|This region showed decreased coupling with the amygdala , insula , and ventromedial prefrontal cortex .
19801154|After chemical challenge , cases showed hypoperfusion in the olfactory , right and left hippocampus , right parahippocampus , right amygdala , right thalamus , right and left Rolandic and right temporal cortex regions -LRB- p < or = 0.01 -RRB- .
19803681|Transient neural activation in human amygdala involved in aversive conditioning of face and voice .
19803681|Previous studies using fMRI and human subjects have reported that the amygdala plays a role in this phenomenon .
19803681|In an fMRI study , there was greater amygdala activation in response to the faces that had been paired with the voice than to those that had not .
19803681|The right amygdala showed transient activity in the early stage of acquisition .
19803681|A psychophysiological interaction analysis indicated that the subcortical pathway from the medial geniculate body to the amygdala played a role in conditioning .
19803681|Modulation of the subcortical pathway by voice stimuli preceded the transient activity in the amygdala .
19803681|The finding that an ecologically valid stimulus elicited the conditioning and amygdala response suggests that our brain is automatically processing unpleasant stimuli in daily life .
19804836|Our results clearly show that right amygdala responds more to threatening than to teasing situations irrespective of the observers ' task .
19804836|When observers ' attention is not explicitly directed to the situation , this heightened amygdala activation goes together with increased activity in body sensitive regions in fusiform gyrus , extrastriate body area-human motion complex and superior temporal sulcus and is associated with a better behavioral performance of the participants during threatening situations .
19818382|By contrast , increased demands in the emotion task -LRB- reappraisal -RRB- were associated with increased activity in ventromedial PFC along with decreased amygdala activity .
19823984|Results indicated that being liked activated primary reward - and self-related regions , including the nucleus accumbens , midbrain -LRB- in an area corresponding to the ventral tegmentum -RRB- , ventromedial prefrontal cortex , posterior cingulate cortex -LRB- including retrosplenial cortex -RRB- , amygdala , and insula/opercular cortex .
19823984|Participants showed greater activation of ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala in response to being liked by people that they regarded highly compared to those they regarded less so .
19828596|Integration of gaze direction and facial expression in patients with unilateral amygdala damage .
19828596|Past studies have shown that amygdala damage can impair recognition of facial expressions , particularly fear , as well as processing of gaze direction ; but the mechanisms responsible for these deficits remain debated .
19828596|Recent accounts of human amygdala function suggest that it is a critical structure involved in self-relevance appraisal .
19828596|Here we investigated facial emotion recognition and its interaction with gaze in patients with unilateral amygdala damage -LRB- n = 19 -RRB- , compared to healthy controls -LRB- n = 10 -RRB- , using computer-generated dynamic face stimuli expressing variable intensities of fear , anger or joy , with different gaze directions -LRB- direct versus averted -RRB- .
19828596|Our results confirm a critical role for the amygdala in self-relevance appraisal , showing an interaction between gaze and emotion in healthy controls , a trend for such interaction in left-damaged patients but not in right-damaged patients .
19828596|These findings do not only provide new insights on human amygdala function , but may also help design novel neuropsychological tests sensitive to amygdala dysfunction in various patient populations .
19833214|Significant pharmacological effects on BOLD-signal were found in the amygdala , medial frontal gyrus , parahippocampal , fusiform and middle temporal gyri .
19833214|Post-hoc t-tests revealed decreased BOLD-signal in the right amygdala and left parahippocampal gyrus in both pharmacological conditions , compared to placebo .
19833214|Both escitalopram and citalopram attenuated BOLD-signal in the amygdala and parahippocampal cortex to emotionally significant stimuli compared to control stimuli .
19846724|The ventral striatum -LRB- VS -RRB- is thought to serve as a gateway whereby associative information from the amygdala and prefrontal regions can influence motor output to guide behavior .
19850137|Associations between the size of the amygdala in infancy and language abilities during the preschool years in normally developing children .
19850137|In this longitudinal study , using T1 structural MRI , we identified links between amygdala volume in normally developing , naturally sleeping , 6-month infants and their subsequent language abilities at 2 , 3 and 4 years .
19850137|Significant and consistent correlations were found between amygdala size and language abilities .
19850137|Children with larger right amygdalae at 6 months had lower scores on expressive and receptive language measures at 2 , 3 , and 4 years .
19850137|Associations between amygdala size and language outcomes have been reported in children with autism .
19850137|The findings presented here extend this association to normally developing children , supporting the idea that the amygdalae might play an important but as yet unspecified role in mediating language acquisition .
19853585|In the ironic sentence condition , the bilateral superior frontal gyrus , middle frontal gyrus , inferior frontal gyrus , medial prefrontal cortex , superior temporal gyrus , inferior parietal lobule , caudate , thalamus , the left insula , and amygdala were activated .
19853585|In the literal sentence condition , the right superior frontal gyrus , the bilateral middle frontal gyrus , inferior frontal gyrus , medial prefrontal cortex , superior temporal gyrus , inferior parietal lobule , caudate , the left insula , the right thalamus , and the left amygdala were activated .
19874870|Hippocampi and amygdalae were manually traced from the 3D magnetic resonance imaging of five affected family members , 10 non-affected relatives , and 15 unrelated matched controls .
19874870|Affected and non-affected relatives were characterized by larger left amygdalae -LRB- 18 % , p = 0.030 -RRB- , smaller right hippocampus -LRB- up to 18 % , p < 0.0005 -RRB- , and reduced hippocampal asymmetry -LRB- p < 0.001 -RRB- than controls .
19874902|However , good correlations between the methods were found for most regions , with the highest correlations shown for the ventricles , whole brain and left medial-inferior temporal gyrus -LRB- r > 0.9 -RRB- , followed by the bilateral amygdala and hippocampus , left superior temporal gyrus , right medial-inferior temporal gyrus and left temporal lobe -LRB- r > 0.8 -RRB- .
19874902|Overlap ratios differed between methods bilaterally in the amygdala , superior temporal gyrus , temporal lobe , left fusiform gyrus and right parahippocampal gyrus -LRB- p < 0.01 -RRB- .
19878138|The aim of this study was to investigate whether in adult patients with ADHD hippocampal or amygdala volumes differs from that in healthy controls and patients with major depression -LRB- MD -RRB- .
19878138|In ADHD , more hyperactivity and less inattention were associated with smaller right amygdala volumes , and more symptoms of depression with larger amygdala volumes .
19878138|CONCLUSION : This study supports findings that the amygdala plays an important role in the systemic brain pathophysiology of ADHD .
19878138|Whether patients with ADHD and larger amygdala volumes are more vulnerable to affective disorders needs further investigation .
19880294|Performing first a random effects analysis of the fMRI data to identify activated regions , we obtained 352 data-point time series for six brain regions : bilateral amygdala , hippocampus and two prefrontal regions -LRB- Brodmann Areas 9 and 45 -RRB- .
19880294|Moreover , the direction of the largest principal component was a significant differentiator between the control and patient populations : the left and right amygdala coefficients were substantially higher in the case of patients , and the coefficients of Brodmann Area 9 were , to a lesser extent , higher in controls .
19884610|MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Scores on the Vietnamese versions of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 -LRB- HSCL -RRB- and Harvard Trauma Questionnaire for depression and posttraumatic stress disorder , respectively ; cerebral regional cortical thickness ; and manual volumetric morphometry of the amygdala , hippocampus , and thalamus .
19884610|Trauma/torture events were associated with bilateral amygdala volume loss -LRB- left , P = .045 ; right , P = .003 -RRB- .
19889986|We investigated 32 patients with chronic pain due to primary hip osteoarthritis and found a characteristic gray matter decrease in patients compared with controls in the anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , right insular cortex and operculum , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- , amygdala , and brainstem .
19889986|After surgery , all 10 patients were completely pain free and we observed a gray matter increase in the DLPFC , ACC , amygdala , and brainstem .
19892319|RESULTS : In patients , but not healthy individuals , val -LRB- risk -RRB- allele load predicted less regional cerebral blood flow in the right dorsolateral PFC , right superior temporal gyrus , and left precuneus , but greater rCBF in the amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus .
19900527|Anticonvulsant effect of aqueous extract of Valeriana officinalis in amygdala-kindled rats : possible involvement of adenosine .

19910719|Dopaminergic modulation of amygdala activity during emotion recognition in patients with Parkinson disease .
19910719|In healthy subjects , levodopa administration leads to a decreased amygdala activation in response to emotional tasks .
19910719|To evaluate the effect of levodopa on amygdala activation , we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging study in nondemented , nondepressed PD patients compared with healthy volunteers .
19910719|A similar right-amygdala activity was seen in both healthy subjects and PD patients in the placebo session .
19910719|Nondemented , nondepressed PD patients thus seem to have relatively preserved DA mesolimbic projections , and consequently , the same dose of levodopa needed to correct the lack of DA in the severely depleted putamen -LRB- motor part of striatum -RRB- would incidentally overdose the mesolimbic projections toward the amygdala .
19911168|Relative increases in rCMglu were observed in frontal cortical regions while relative decreases occurred in the putamen and right amygdala after both doses .
19914044|Reduced anxiety and fatigue in A1 + men were significantly associated with greater activity within a right orbitofrontal region previously implicated in cognitive control , and less activity in structures associated with anxiety -LRB- amygdala -RRB- , fatigue -LRB- thalamus -RRB- , and craving/reinforcement -LRB- striatum -RRB- .
19925853|Along electrodes traversing the amygdala the majority of LEPs were recorded from dorsal contacts near the central nucleus of the amygdala and the nucleus basalis .
19926861|Emotions induced by pleasant or unpleasant pictures modulated the responses to painful electrical stimulations in the right insula , paracentral lobule , parahippocampal gyrus , thalamus , and amygdala .
19926861|In contrast , activity in the thalamus , amygdala , and several prefrontal areas was associated with the modulation of spinal reflex responses .

19931399|savitzj@mail.nih.gov MRI-based reports of both abnormally increased and decreased amygdala volume in bipolar disorder -LRB- BD -RRB- have surfaced in the literature .
19931399|Two major methodological weaknesses characterizing extant studies are treatment with medication and inaccurate segmentation of the amygdala due to limitations in spatial and tissue contrast resolution .
19931399|The amygdala was manually segmented by one rater blind to diagnosis , using coronal images .
19931399|The unmedicated BD patients displayed smaller left and right amygdala volumes than their matched control group -LRB- p < 0.01 -RRB- .
19931399|Conversely , the BD subjects undergoing medication treatment showed a trend towards greater amygdala volumes than their matched HC sample -LRB- p = 0.051 -RRB- .
19931399|Right and left amygdala volumes were larger -LRB- p < 0.05 -RRB- or trended larger , respectively , in the medicated BD sample compared with the unmedicated BD sample .
19931399|The two control groups did not differ from each other in either left or right amygdala volume .
19931399|Here we extend these results to the amygdala .
19931399|We raise the possibility that neuroplastic changes in the amygdala associated with BD are moderated by some mood stabilizing medications .
19931400|BDNF gene polymorphism -LRB- Val66Met -RRB- predicts amygdala and anterior hippocampus responses to emotional faces in anxious and depressed adolescents .
19931400|The current study investigated the association between BDNF genotype and amygdala-hippocampal responses to emotional stimuli in adolescents with anxiety disorders and/or major depressive disorder -LRB- MDD -RRB- and in healthy adolescents .
19931400|Twenty-seven unmedicated patients with acutely-impairing current anxiety disorders and/or MDD and 31 healthy adolescents , matched on age , gender and IQ , rated their fear of fearful , angry , neutral and happy facial expressions during collection of fMRI data on the amygdala and hippocampus .
19931400|Left and right amygdala and hippocampal responses were analyzed using repeated-measures analyses of variance models , with diagnosis -LRB- patients , healthy -RRB- and genotype -LRB- Met-carriers , Val/Val homozygotes -RRB- as between-group factors and facial expression -LRB- fearful , angry , neutral , happy -RRB- as a within-subject factor .
19931400|Significant effects of diagnosis and diagnosis-by-genotype interactions -LRB- F 's > 4 , p 's < 0.05 -RRB- characterized activations in amygdala and anterior hippocampal regions .
19937724|Within all other regions known to subserve the perceptual audiovisual integration of human social signals -LRB- i.e. , amygdala , fusiform gyrus , thalamus -RRB- , no such linked responses were observed .
19942229|Moreover , NR showed a significantly lower GM density as compared to R in bilateral posterior cingulate , as well as anterior insula , anterior parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala in the right hemisphere .
19951270|Arterial spin labeling demonstrates that focal amygdalar glutamatergic agonist infusion leads to rapid diffuse cerebral activation .
19951270|OBJECTIVES : To investigate acute effects of intra-amygdalar excitatory amino acid administration on blood flow , relaxation time and apparent diffusion coefficient in rat brain .
19951270|MATERIALS AND METHODS : Several days after MR-compatible cannula placement in right basolateral amygdala , anesthetized rats were imaged at 7 T. Relative cerebral blood flow -LRB- CBF -RRB- was measured before and 60 min after infusion of 10 nmol KA , cAMPA , ATPA , or normal saline using arterial spin labeling .
19951270|rCBF , T -LRB- 2 -RRB- and ADC values were evaluated in bilateral basolateral amygdala , hippocampus , basal ganglia , frontal and parietal regions .
19951270|CONCLUSIONS : Intra-amygdalar injection of GluR agonists evoked bilateral seizure activity and increased rCBF , greater for KA and AMPA than selective ATPA GluR5 activation .
19955360|Additional analysis suggested that impairment in fear recognition can result from damage to the IFOF and not the amygdala .
19959343|agilbert2@nshs.edu Coronary Artery Disease -LRB- CAD -RRB- and Major Depressive Disorder -LRB- MDD -RRB- commonly co-occur and may be linked by a network of brain regions involved in emotion regulation , including the orbitofrontal cortex , amygdala/parahippocamal region and insula .
19959343|We found decreased grey matter volumes in the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex , bilateral amygdala/parahippocampal gyrus and right insula in CAD+MDD versus CTRL subjects and decreased grey matter volumes in the bilateral amygdala/parahippocampal regions in CAD+MDD versus CAD subjects .
19959914|Manual tracing of hippocampal and amygdalar volumes and visual rating of white matter lesions were made .
19959914|Hippocampal and amygdalar volumes were not associated with age , except for the right amygdala -LRB- B -0.159 , 95 % CI -0.28 to -0.03 , p = 0.016 -RRB- .
19961836|Group analysis of fMRI data revealed that the left ventral striatum -LRB- VS -RRB- and amygdala activated in response to the CS + in all the three groups .

19961836|Enhancing dopamine transmission via amphetamine was associated with reduced task differences and significant functional connectivity for both CS + and CS - conditions between the left VS seed and regions modulated by DA , such as the left VTA/SN , right caudate , left amygdala , left middle frontal gyrus -LRB- BA 46 -RRB- , and bilateral ventromedial PFC -LRB- BA 10 -RRB- .
19961836|Blocking dopamine transmission via haloperidol was associated with significant functional connectivity across an alternate network of regions including the left amygdala seed and the right insula , the left ACC -LRB- BA 24/32 -RRB- , bilateral IPL -LRB- BA 40 -RRB- , precuneus -LRB- BA 7 -RRB- , post-central gyrus , middle frontal gyrus -LRB- BA 46 -RRB- , and supplementary motor area -LRB- SMA , BA 6 -RRB- to the CS + versus the CS - .

19962442|dannlow@uni-muenster.de A functional polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene -LRB- 5-HTTLPR -RRB- has been reported to modulate amygdala responsiveness to negative environmental cues .
19962442|However , it remains unclear whether 5-HTTLPR modulates amygdala responses specifically to negative stimuli or rather to emotionally salient stimuli in general .
19962442|In 44 healthy subjects , amygdala responses to subliminally presented happy and sad facial expressions were assessed by means of fMRI at 3 Tesla .
19962442|We observed a robust emotion by genotype group interaction in the right amygdala .
19962442|Risk allele carriers -LRB- S or L -LRB- G -RRB- -RRB- showed similar amygdala responses to happy faces compared to homozygous L -LRB- A -RRB- L -LRB- A -RRB- carriers but increased amygdala responses to sad faces .
19962442|The right amygdala was the only anatomical region across the whole brain demonstrating this interaction at a reasonable threshold .
19962442|It appears that whereas 5-HTT gene variation modulates automatic amygdala responsiveness to sad faces , no such association was found for happy faces .
19962861|At baseline , Trait Anxiety Inventory measures covaried positively with relative brain activity bilaterally in the dorsal anterior cingulate , superior temporal gyri , parahippocampal gyri , amygdala , hippocampus , ventral striatum , and right insula ; state anxiety showed a similar pattern .
19962861|Change in trait anxiety covaried positively with changes in relative activity in right amygdala and hippocampus .
20004364|Higher anhedonia was associated with reduced activation to positive versus negative stimuli in bilateral amygdala and right ventral striatum in patients and in bilateral caudate in control subjects .
20004364|Reduced activation of the striatum and amygdala may contribute to symptoms of anhedonia by failing to signal the salience of positive events .
20005953|Here , we tested the hypothesis that previously observed histological and neurochemical changes in the striatum of amygdala-kindled rats as a model of temporal lobe epilepsy are reflected in alterations of spontaneous striatal firing rates and patterns .
20005953|Because experimental histological and clinical imaging studies indicated a bilateral involvement of the striatum in epilepsy-induced neuroplasticity , in vivo single-unit recordings were done bilaterally 1 day after a kindled seizure in rats kindled via the right amygdala .
20007242|During remembering of high self-involvement events , connections between the left hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex were ` in synchrony ' with connections between the medial prefrontal cortex and the right amygdala-hippocampal complex .
20007242|By contrast , the hippocampal-prefrontal connection was ` out-of-sync ' with the prefrontal-amygdala connection during retrieval of low self-involvement memories .
20007242|This result is discussed in terms of two memory systems -LRB- one that is hippocampal-based and one that is amygdala-hippocampal-based -RRB- that may be involved to varying degrees depending upon the characteristics of a remembered event .
20007465|Positive correlations between olfactory performance and gray matter volume were observed in the right piriform cortex in early PD patients and in the right amygdala in moderately advanced patients .
20011048|An event-related beamformer source analysis model was applied in three time windows following the first face presentations : 80 to 130 ms , 140 to 190 ms , and 210 to 260 ms. The frontal lobe and the right internal temporal lobe part , including the amygdala , reacted as soon as 80 ms of latency to fear occurring in the peripheral vision .
20026086|Errors recruit both cognitive and emotional monitoring systems : simultaneous intracranial recordings in the dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus and amygdala combined with fMRI .
20026086|More surprisingly , we found that the left amygdala also participated to error monitoring -LRB- although no emotional stimuli were used -RRB- , but with a very different neurophysiological profile as compared with the dorsal cingulate cortex .
20026086|Additional fMRI investigation in the same patient confirmed a differential involvement of the dorsal cingulate cortex vs. amygdala in error monitoring during this go/nogo task .
20026086|Finally , these intracranial results for the left amygdala were replicated in a second patient with intracranial electrodes in the right amygdala .
20026086|Altogether , these results suggest that the amygdala may register the motivational significance of motor actions on a trial-by-trial basis , while the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex may provide signals concerning failures of cognitive control and behavioral adjustment .
20026086|More generally , these data shed new light on neural mechanisms underlying self-monitoring by showing that even `` simple '' motor actions recruit not only executive cognitive processes -LRB- in dorsal cingulate -RRB- but also affective processes -LRB- in amygdala -RRB- .
20026221|Here we measured the effects of COMT Val108/158Met genotype on the volume of two regions within the medial temporal lobe , the amygdala and hippocampus , in patients with schizophrenia and healthy control subjects .
20026221|An automated atlas-based segmentation algorithm was used to generate volumetric measures of the amygdala and hippocampus .
20026221|Across patients and controls , each copy of the COMT met allele was associated on average with a 2.6 % increase in right amygdala volume , a 3.8 % increase in left amygdala volume and a 2.2 % increase in right hippocampus volume .
20040244|Hippocampal subdivision and amygdalar volumes in patients in an at-risk mental state for schizophrenia .
20040244|Recent studies involving patients at UHR showed contradictory results for hippocampal volume , and only 1 study reported that amygdalar volume was unchanged between healthy patients and those at UHR .
20040244|We measured hippocampal and amygdalar volumes from MRI scans by use of BRAINS2 to manually trace the regions of interest .
20040244|First-episode patients had significantly smaller left amygdalar volumes than did healthy individuals or those at UHR .
20040244|CONCLUSION : Our findings suggest that parts of the hippocampal-amygdalar complex are involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia .
20040244|Further investigations are needed to determine whether structural changes of the left amygdala play a role during transition from the prodromal phase to the first manifest episode of schizophrenia .
20045473|In the task relative to the control condition , the right amygdala was activated both in patients with AN-R and in patients with AN-BP .
20045736|Unattended emotional faces elicit early lateralized amygdala-frontal and fusiform activations .
20045736|The amygdalae are known to play a key role in emotion processing .
20045736|It is suggested that the amygdalae process threat-related information through a fast subcortical route and slower cortical feedback .
20045736|The present study investigated event-related neural responses during processing of facial emotions in the unattended hemifield using magnetoencephalography -LRB- MEG -RRB- and found activations of the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex to fear as early as 100 ms. The right amygdala exhibited temporally dissociated activations to input from different visual fields , suggesting early subcortical versus later cortical processing of fear .
20056020|Structures of interest were : the temporal lobe , the amygdala-hippocampus complex -LRB- AHC -RRB- and the frontal lobe .
20056024|These deficits are associated with changes in brain activation in the amygdala and the superior temporal sulcus -LRB- STS -RRB- .
20056024|Region-of-interest analysis of functional brain imaging data revealed no difference between groups during aToM , but a hyperactivation in the schizophrenia group in the left amygdala and right STS during emotion recognition and the processing of neutral facial expressions .
20060103|Within the patient group , more severe AVH were associated with reduced neural coupling between left TPJ and bilateral anterior cingulate as well as the bilateral amygdala .
20071507|Subjects were scanned using negative valence/high arousal versus neutral visual stimuli that we demonstrated activated stress response circuitry -LSB- amygdala , hypothalamus , hippocampus , brainstem , orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- , medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- , and anterior cingulate gyrus -LRB- ACG -RRB- -RSB- .
20071507|Using SPM8b , there were few significant differences in blood oxygenation level-dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- signal changes in men compared to EF women , except ventromedial nucleus -LRB- VMN -RRB- , lateral hypothalamic area -LRB- LHA -RRB- , left amygdala , and ACG .
20079775|Imaging data showed that the left amygdala was activated during the encoding conditions of negative pictures relative to neutral pictures , and the left orbitofrontal cortex was activated during the encoding conditions of high reward pictures relative to low reward pictures .
20079775|Although we could not find correlations between recognition performance and activity of these three regions , we speculate that the right hippocampus may integrate the effects of emotion -LRB- processed in the amygdala -RRB- and monetary reward -LRB- processed in the orbitofrontal cortex -RRB- on episodic memory encoding .
20093991|Sex-related differences in amygdala activity influences immediate memory .
20093991|deane.aikins@yale.edu Despite a well-established relationship between amygdala activation during learning and long-term memory , contributions of amygdala to immediate memory have not been studied to date .
20093991|We used functional magnetic resonance imaging at 1.5-T field strength to determine whether amygdala responses to emotional pictures would predict performance on an immediate recognition memory test .
20093991|Sex differences in amygdala activation were related to false-positive error rates in recognizing unpleasant pictures .
20093991|Specifically , increased right amygdala activation during unpleasant picture viewing was related to lower false-positive rates for men and higher false-positive rates for women .
20093991|Our results indicate that increased amygdala activation while viewing unpleasant pictures may preferentially facilitate immediate recognition memory in men relative to women .
20096792|During the `` Live '' interaction , as compared to the Recorded conditions , greater activation was seen in brain regions involved in social cognition and reward , including the right temporoparietal junction -LRB- rTPJ -RRB- , anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , right superior temporal sulcus -LRB- rSTS -RRB- , ventral striatum , and amygdala .
20110703|In this study , we determined the volumes of the hippocampus , the entorhinal cortex -LRB- EC -RRB- and the amygdala to provide biological evidence for AD in SMI .
20110703|Individuals with SMI had reduced volumes of the hippocampus bilaterally -LRB- right p = 0.001 ; left p < 0.001 -RRB- , the bilateral EC -LRB- right p = 0.031 , left p = 0.006 -RRB- and the right amygdala -LRB- p = 0.01 -RRB- compared to the control group .
20110703|CONCLUSION : Volume reduction of bilateral hippocampus , bilateral EC and right amygdala supports the concept of SMI as a very early manifestation of AD prior to MCI .
20127873|In our previous studies , we suggested that amygdala -LRB- AMG -RRB- and premotor cortex -LRB- PM -RRB- play a role in the preparation of the observers ' motor response required by the situation .
2012905|The amygdala was smaller on the left than the right in controls but not in schizophrenics .
20141298|In addition , dispositional mindfulness was negatively correlated with resting activity in the amygdala , bilaterally , whereas depressive symptomatology was positively correlated with activity in the right amygdala .
20141298|Similarly , when viewing emotional faces , amygdala reactivity was positively correlated with depressive symptomatology and negatively correlated with dispositional mindfulness , an effect that was largely attributable to differences in resting activity .
20141298|These findings indicate that mindfulness is associated with intrinsic neural activity and that changes in resting amygdala activity could be a potential mechanism by which mindfulness-based depression treatments elicit therapeutic improvement .
20148332|During acquisition , fMRI results showed increased activation for the conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS + -LRB- unpaired -RRB- -RRB- when compared with the non-conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS - -RRB- in the right amygdala , the insulae , the anterior cingulate cortex and the parahippocampal gyrus , all regions known to be involved in emotional processing .
20148332|In addition , a linearly decreasing activation in the right amygdala/hippocampus for the CS - across the acquisition phase was found .
20150341|ellen-vanderplas@uiowa.edu Research into the neural underpinnings of fear and fear-related pathology has highlighted the role of the amygdala .
20150341|For instance , bilateral damage to the amygdaloid complex is associated with decreased appreciation of danger and recognition of fear in humans , whereas enlarged amygdala volume is associated with internalizing syndromes .
20150341|It is unknown whether amygdala volume and fearfulness are related in the absence of pathology .
20150341|We examined the correlation between normal fearfulness and amygdala morphology in 116 healthy children and adolescents -LRB- 60 boys , 56 girls , age 7-17 years -RRB- .
20150341|Fearfulness was measured using the parent ratings on the Pediatric Behavior Scale and amygdala volumes were determined by manual tracing .
20150341|We found a positive correlation between right amygdala volume in girls -LRB- r = 0.29 -RRB- .
20150341|Given the role of enlarged amygdala volume in pathology , these findings may indicate that variation in amygdala morphology marks susceptibility to internalizing disorders .
20153813|Topographic and source analysis identified four distinct processing steps between 200 and 1000 ms. Activation started ipsilateral to the stimulated nostril in the mesial and lateral temporal cortex -LRB- amygdala , parahippocampal gyrus , superior temporal gyrus , insula -RRB- .
20154357|Role of amygdala and hippocampus in the neural circuit subserving conditioned defeat in Syrian hamsters .
20154357|psycmm@langate.gsu.edu We examined the roles of the amygdala and hippocampus in the formation of emotionally relevant memories using an ethological model of conditioned fear termed conditioned defeat -LRB- CD -RRB- .
20154357|To test for a functional connection between the VH and basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , we used a classic functional connectivity design wherein injections are made unilaterally in brain areas either on the same or opposite sides of the brain .
20159144|Abnormal left and right amygdala-orbitofrontal cortical functional connectivity to emotional faces : state versus trait vulnerability markers of depression in bipolar disorder .
20159144|The FC was computed as linear and nonlinear dependence measures between amygdala and OFC time series .
20159144|Effects of group , laterality , and emotion intensity upon amygdala-OFC FC and amygdala-OFC FC white matter fractional anisotropy -LRB- FA -RRB- relationships were examined .
20159144|RESULTS : The BD versus HC showed significantly greater right amygdala-OFC FC -LRB- p < or = .001 -RRB- in the sad experiment and significantly reduced bilateral amygdala-OFC FC -LRB- p = .007 -RRB- in the happy experiment .
20159144|Depressed but not remitted female BD versus female HC showed significantly greater left amygdala-OFC FC -LRB- p = .001 -RRB- to all faces in the sad experiment and reduced bilateral amygdala-OFC FC to intense happy faces -LRB- p = .01 -RRB- .
20159144|There was a significant nonlinear relationship -LRB- p = .001 -RRB- between left amygdala-OFC FC to sad faces and FA in HC .
20159144|In BD , antidepressants were associated with significantly reduced left amygdala-OFC FC to mild sad faces -LRB- p = .001 -RRB- .
20159144|CONCLUSIONS : In BD , abnormally elevated right amygdala-OFC FC to sad stimuli might represent a trait vulnerability for depression , whereas abnormally elevated left amygdala-OFC FC to sad stimuli and abnormally reduced amygdala-OFC FC to intense happy stimuli might represent a depression state marker .
20159144|Nonlinear amygdala-OFC FC-FA relationships in BD and HC require further study .
20162030|Over the following days , the patient had no further haemoptysis and so far clinical examination showed no evidence of the original mass -LRB- slight haemorrhagic suffusion of the right anterior amygdala region -RRB- .
20163442|A significant relationship between loss of hippocampal connections and regional GMV atrophy was found involving the putamen , pallidum , middle and inferior temporal areas , amygdala and ceberellar hemisphere .
20169080|Additionally , liquid-specific tonic activation increases were found in subcortical regions -LRB- amygdala , dorsal striatum , nucleus accumbens -RRB- , indicating an anatomical double dissociation in the locus of sustained activation .
20184808|Because faces provide nonverbal cues that support social interactions , many studies of ASD have examined neural structures that process faces , including the amygdala , ventromedial prefrontal cortex and superior and middle temporal gyri .
20184808|RESULTS : In response to emotional faces , those in the ASD group showed greater right amygdala activation than those in the control group .
20184808|A preliminary psychophysiological connectivity analysis showed that ASD participants had stronger positive right amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex coupling and weaker positive right amygdala and temporal lobe coupling than controls .
20184808|CONCLUSION : When attention bias to emotional faces was equivalent between ASD and control groups , ASD was associated with greater amygdala activation .
20184808|Preliminary analyses showed that ASD participants had stronger connectivity between the amygdala ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- a network implicated in emotional modulation -RRB- and weaker connectivity between the amygdala and temporal lobe -LRB- a pathway involved in the identification of facial expressions , although areas of group differences were generally in a more anterior region of the temporal lobe than what is typically reported for emotional face processing -RRB- .
20184810|Reduced amygdalar and hippocampal size in adults with generalized social phobia .
20184810|eirle@gwdg.de BACKGROUND : Structural and functional brain imaging studies suggest abnormalities of the amygdala and hippocampus in posttraumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder .
20184810|METHODS : In total , 24 patients with generalized social phobia -LRB- GSP -RRB- and 24 healthy controls underwent 3-dimensional structural magnetic resonance imaging of the amygdala and hippocampus and a clinical investigation .
20184810|RESULTS : Compared with controls , GSP patients had significantly reduced amygdalar -LRB- 13 % -RRB- and hippocampal -LRB- 8 % -RRB- size .
20184810|The reduction in the size of the amygdala was statistically significant for men but not women .
20191578|MRS techniques were used to study brain metabolites in the amygdala , thalami , and prefrontal cortex of these women .
20191578|RESULTS : In comparison with healthy controls , patients with FM showed higher levels of glutamate/glutamine -LRB- Glx -RRB- compounds -LRB- mean + / - SD 11.9 + / - 1.6 arbitrary units -LSB- AU -RSB- versus 13.4 + / - 1.7 AU in controls and patients , respectively ; t = 2.517 , 35 df , corrected P = 0.03 -RRB- and a higher Glx : creatine ratio -LRB- mean + / - SD 2.1 + / - 0.4 versus 2.4 + / - 1.4 , respectively ; t = 2.373 , 35 df , corrected P = 0.04 -RRB- in the right amygdala .
20191578|In FM patients with increased levels of pain intensity , greater fatigue , and more symptoms of depression , inositol levels in the right amygdala and right thalamus were significantly higher .
20191578|CONCLUSION : The distinctive metabolic features found in the right amygdala of patients with FM suggest the possible existence of a neural dysfunction in emotional processing .
20200600|During nonconscious perception of facial affect , healthy adults commonly activate a right-lateralized pathway comprising the superior colliculus , pulvinar , and amygdala .
20200600|Left amygdala activation differed among the three affects , showing reductions to masked anger and increases to masked fear and happy faces .
20200600|During masked fear , left amygdala activation correlated positively with extrastriate cortex and temporal poles and negatively with precuneus and middle cingulate gyrus .
20200600|Responses of the left amygdala to masked anger correlated positively with right parahippocampal gyrus and negatively with dorsal anterior cingulate .
20207467|This attention effect appears to be mediated through a neural network consisting of the amygdala , anterior cingulate , and visual cortex .
20207692|Reactivity in the right anterior insula was predictive of individuals ' subjective experience of anxious anticipation for both aversive and neutral stimuli , whereas the amygdala was predictive of anticipatory anxiety for aversive stimuli .
20207692|In addition , anxious anticipatory activation in the left insula and left amygdala covaried with participants ' level of trait anxiety , particularly when the anticipated event was proximal .
20215924|A genome-wide association study of amygdala activation in youths with and without bipolar disorder .
20215924|A previous functional magnetic resonance imaging study found that amygdala activation during a face-processing task differed between pediatric patients with bipolar disorder -LRB- BD -RRB- and healthy controls .
20215924|After quality control , 104,043 SNPs were tested against normalized amygdala activation scores obtained from the right and left hemispheres .
20215924|RESULTS : Right amygdala activation under the hostility contrast was most strongly associated with an SNP in the gene DOK5 -LRB- rs2023454 , p = 4.88 x 10 -LRB- -7 -RRB- , false discovery rate = 0.05 -RRB- .
20215924|CONCLUSIONS : To our knowledge , this is the first genome-wide association study of amygdala activation in adolescents with BD .
20215924|Although preliminary , these data suggest that DOK5 and perhaps several other genes influence the magnitude of amygdala activation during face processing , particularly in those with BD .
20215939|Adolescents with MDD demonstrated lower fractional anisotropy -LRB- FA -RRB- in the WM tract connecting subgenual ACC to amygdala in the right hemisphere .
20223639|-LRB- 3 -RRB- Patients with mesial auras showed significant ipsilateral GMV reductions in hippocampus and amygdala , particularly right TLE group , who presented greater extension of GMV reduction in the entorhinal cortex .
20223639|Significant reductions in hippocampus , amygdala and insula were seen in patients with anterior mesio-lateral auras .
20225222|However , hyper-connectivity observed with other regions -LRB- right hippocampus and amygdala , and other cortical structures -RRB- suggests a more pervasive alteration of brain connectivity in this disease .
20226638|Correlation between amygdala volume and age in bipolar disorder - a systematic review and meta-analysis of structural MRI studies .
20226638|The amygdala has gained special interest regarding the neuropathology of bipolar disorder -LRB- BD -RRB- .
20226638|Structural magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- studies with patients suffering from BD have yielded quite inconsistent results with respect to amygdala volume .
20226638|We performed a meta-analysis of structural MRI studies that investigated right and left amygdala volume in pediatric and adult patients with BD .
20226638|The aim was to assess the heterogeneous findings and to investigate whether a correlation between amygdala volume and the patient 's age exists .
20226638|Studies were searched for in `` Pub Med '' -LRB- last search June 2007 -RRB- , and data for right and left amygdala volume in cm -LRB- 3 -RRB- were extracted and combined in a meta-analysis .
20226638|The impact of age on the difference in amygdala volume between patients and HC was assessed by meta-regression .
20226638|The amygdala volume was bilaterally reduced in the overall sample of patients with BD and the pediatric subsample .
20226638|A meta-regression analysis revealed a positive correlation between mean age and amygdala volume in patients with BD .
20226638|We speculate that amygdala volume is reduced at the onset of the disease and increases with age .
20233962|In contrast , depression was associated with more activity in the anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- dorsal ACC and rostral ACC -RRB- and the bilateral amygdala .
20233962|Results imply that depression , particularly when accompanied by anxious arousal , may result in a failure to implement top-down processing by appropriate brain regions -LRB- left DLPFC , right IFG -RRB- due to increased activation in regions associated with responding to emotionally salient information -LRB- right DLPFC , amygdala -RRB- .
20236805|Temperament at 5 years of age predicts amygdala and orbitofrontal volume in the right hemisphere in adolescence .
20236805|Region of interest measures were traced for the OFC and the amygdala , and confirmed with voxel based morphometry .
20236805|Also , larger amygdala volume was associated with more time spent proximal to the mother .
20236805|Behavioral control , including both over - and under-control , is likely to be subserved by neural circuitry associated with emotion regulation including the right OFC and the amygdala .
20237128|Without methylphenidate , -LSB- 11C -RSB- - raclopride binding potential values were greater in apathetic patients bilaterally in the orbitofrontal , dorsolateral prefrontal , posterior cingulate and temporal cortices , left striatum and right amygdala , reflecting greater dopamine D2/D3 receptor density and/or reduced synaptic dopamine level in these areas .
20237871|In contrast , cerebral glucose metabolism was significantly decreased in both cerebellum , the left thalamus , the left olfactory , the right middle temporal gyrus , the right amygdala , and the right insula -LRB- P -LRB- uncorrected -RRB- < 0.005 -RRB- .
20303066|In chronic patients , longer duration of illness was associated with increased gray matter in a cluster that included basal ganglia , subgenual ACC , and amygdala .
20307012|haleh.farahbod@gmail.com Neuroimaging experiments of amygdala activity during rest have shown abnormal amygdalar lateralization in Major Depressive Disorder -LRB- MDD -RRB- .
20307012|The current study is an exploratory investigation of the use of the neuroimaging technique Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography -LRB- LORETA -RRB- to measure current source density -LRB- CSD -RRB- in the amygdala .
20307012|Results showed that for both MDD and control groups , the right amygdala displayed higher overall activity -LRB- across frequencies -RRB- than the left , both at rest , and while viewing neutral faces .
20307012|Results also showed that controls displayed significant differences between resting and viewing neutral images across all four bands in the right amygdala , with all four bands having higher CSD values in the right amygdala .
20308792|Mean diffusivity -LRB- MD -RRB- values increased progressively across the three groups in the bilateral hippocampus , amygdala , and in the right caudate .
20336623|Chronic nicotine exposure produces lateralized , age-dependent dendritic remodeling in the rodent basolateral amygdala .
20336623|hadley.bergstrom@usuhs.mil This study investigated the dendritic morphology of neurons located in the right and left basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and infralimbic -LRB- IL -RRB- cortex following chronic nicotine exposure during adolescence or adulthood .
20336658|Data of micro - -LRB- mean diffusivity , MD -RRB- and macro - -LRB- volume -RRB- structural changes of six bilateral deep gray matter structures -LRB- thalamus , caudate nucleus , putamen , hippocampus , amygdala , and globus pallidus -RRB- were analyzed with reference to years of formal education .
20339549|For centrally presented faces , the emotions were separated fast , first in the right superior temporal sulcus -LRB- STS ; 35-48 ms -RRB- , followed by the right amygdala -LRB- 57-64 ms -RRB- and medial pre-frontal cortex -LRB- 83-96 ms -RRB- .
20339549|For faces presented in the periphery , the emotions were separated first in the ipsilateral amygdala and contralateral STS .
20339549|We conclude that amygdala and STS likely play a different role in early visual processing , recruiting distinct neural networks for action : the amygdala alerts sub-cortical centers for appropriate autonomic system response for fight or flight decisions , while the STS facilitates more cognitive appraisal of situations and links appropriate cortical sites together .
20344883|In comparison of two different palm skin temperature change groups , more significant activation over bilateral caudate head , right lentiform and periaqueductal gray -LRB- PAG -RRB- were found in the temperature-increased group , but palm temperature-decreased patients revealed more significant activation over bilateral anterior cingulated cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , insula , primary somatosensory gyrus -LRB- SI -RRB- , orbitofrontal cortex , occipital cortex , hippocampus and amygdala formation .
20350171|Among preferentially activated regions for personally familiar over famous faces , robust suppression in differential activation was exhibited in the bilateral medial and anterior temporal structures , left amygdala , and right posterior STS , all of which are known to process episodic and semantic information .
20350176|fMRI analyses revealed that the right amygdala predicted subsequent emotional memory in the shallow more than deep condition , whereas the right ventrolateral PFC demonstrated the reverse pattern .
20350176|Furthermore , the association of these regions with the hippocampus was modulated by valence : the amygdala-hippocampal link was strongest for negative stimuli , whereas the prefrontal-hippocampal link was strongest for positive stimuli .
20350176|Taken together , these results suggest two distinct activation patterns underlying emotional memory formation : an amygdala component that promotes memory during shallow encoding , especially for negative information , and a prefrontal component that provides extra benefits during deep encoding , especially for positive information .
20350587|In contrast , epsilon4 + subjects showed activity decreases in the right amygdala during successful item recognition and in the prefrontal cortex bilaterally during spatial context retrieval when compared to epsilon4 - subjects .
20357121|Medial temporal memory predictors were modulated by scene repetition : the right anterior hippocampus and right amygdala predicted memory for novel scenes only , whereas posterior hippocampi predicted memory for repeated scenes only .
20360158|The HC and RLAI groups demonstrated greater activation in the left amygdala in response to intensively fearful faces , and in right cerebellum to intensively happy faces compared with CONV patients .
20360158|Our results suggest that networks implicated in the allocation of attentional resources -LRB- VMPFC -RRB- and emotion processing -LRB- amygdala , cerebellum -RRB- are differentially affected in patients on CONV versus RLAI .
20371508|Amygdala activity to affective stimuli is well characterized in healthy volunteers with greater amygdala activity to both negative and positive stimuli relative to neutral stimuli , and greater activity to negative relative to positive stimuli .
20371508|We investigated the relationship between conversion disorder and affect by assessing amygdala activity to affective stimuli .
20371508|We also assessed functional connectivity between the amygdala and regions associated with motor preparation .
20371508|Post hoc analyses revealed that whereas healthy volunteers had greater right amygdala activity to fearful versus neutral compared with happy versus neutral as expected , there were no valence differences in patients with conversion disorder .
20371508|The time course analysis also revealed greater right amygdala activity in patients with conversion disorder for happy stimuli -LRB- t = 2.96 , P = 0.006 -RRB- -LRB- with a trend for fearful stimuli , t = 1.81 , P = 0.08 -RRB- compared with healthy volunteers , with a pattern suggestive of impaired amygdala habituation even when controlling for depressive and anxiety symptoms .
20371508|Using psychophysiological interaction analysis , patients with conversion disorder had greater functional connectivity between the right amygdala and the right supplementary motor area during both fearful versus neutral , and happy versus neutral ` stimuli ' compared with healthy volunteers .
20371508|These results were confirmed with Granger Causality Modelling analysis indicating a directional influence from the right amygdala to the right supplementary motor area to happy stimuli -LRB- P < 0.05 -RRB- with a similar trend observed to fearful stimuli -LRB- P = 0.07 -RRB- .
20393457|After physostigmine , cocaine-addicted subjects showed altered rCBF , relative to controls , in limbic regions , including the left hippocampus , left amygdala , and right insula .
20398771|Additionally , we confirmed activation of the right amygdala and right thalamus to the masked surprised faces , which was previously proved to be involved in the unconscious emotional perception system .
20412835|Neural correlates to seen gaze-direction and head orientation in the macaque monkey amygdala .
20412835|Human neuropsychological studies suggest that the amygdala is implicated in social cognition , in which cognition of seen gaze-direction , especially the direct gaze , is essential , and that the perception of gaze direction is modulated by the head orientation of the facial stimuli .
20412835|In the present study , neuronal activity was recorded from the macaque monkey amygdala during performance of a sequential delayed non-matching-to-sample task based on gaze direction .
20412835|Most amygdalar face neurons discriminated both gaze direction and head orientation , and exhibited a significant interaction between the two types about information .
20412835|The results suggest that information of both gaze and head direction is integrated in the amygdala , and that the amygdala is implicated in detection of direct gaze .
20415605|This is consistent with previous research indicating that the VLPFC may facilitate effective responding to underlying neural correlates of anxiety in other brain regions , such as the amygdala .
2043270|Delta activity from amygdala in squirrel monkeys -LRB- Saimiri sciureus -RRB- : influence of social and environmental context .
2043270|A previous study reported that power in the delta band of the amygdala is selectively elevated when primates are exposed to affectively ladened stimuli -LRB- Kling , Steklis , & Deutsch , 1979 -RRB- .
2043270|Finally , recordings in an environment in which shock training had previously occurred showed a striking lateralization of delta activity in the right amygdala but not in the cortex .
20435098|There are lack of significant effects in the mean glucose metabolism of both hemispheres in hippocampus and amygdala induced by CMS possibly because of various reasons .
20439388|RESULTS : Patients showed greater regional mu-opioid BP -LRB- ND -RRB- than did comparison subjects at baseline -LRB- neutral state -RRB- bilaterally in the orbitofrontal cortex , caudate , and nucleus accumbens and in the left amygdala , but lower BP -LRB- ND -RRB- in the posterior thalamus .
20439388|Sadness induction was associated with greater reductions in BP -LRB- ND -RRB- -LRB- endogenous opioid system activation -RRB- in the patient group than in the comparison group in the pregenual anterior cingulate , left orbitofrontal cortex , left ventral pallidum , left amygdala , and left inferior temporal cortex .
20443979|RESULTS : Applying single MRI variables for the differentiation of AD versus CN , the area under curve -LRB- AUC -RRB- of receiver operating characteristic curves -LRB- ROCCs -RRB- was highest for rVOL variables -LRB- maximum of 0.972 for right amygdala -RRB- .
20443979|A composite marker selected and weighted by logistic regression containing left amygdalar rCBF , left hippocampal and right amygdalar rVOLs gave a diagnostic accuracy for AD versus CN of 100 % .
20446172|Previous research suggests hypoactivity in response to the visual perception of faces in the fusiform gyri and amygdalae of individuals with autism .
20446172|Here , using functional magnetic resonance imaging , we report `` normalization '' of activity in the right fusiform gyrus , but not the amygdalae , when individuals with autism were compelled to perform visual scanpaths that involved fixating on the eyes of a fearful face .
20450277|Tractography of the amygdala and hippocampus : anatomical study and application to selective amygdalohippocampectomy .
20450277|OBJECT : The aim of this study was to evaluate , using diffusion tensor tractography , the white matter fibers crossing the hippocampus and the amygdala , and to perform a volumetric analysis and an anatomical study of the connections of these 2 structures .
20450277|Volumetric regions of interest were manually created to delineate the amygdala , the hippocampus , and the volume of resection .
20450277|With respect to the fibers crossing the amygdala , the authors identified the stria terminalis and the uncinate fasciculus .
20450277|CONCLUSIONS : This diffusion tensor tractography study allowed for good visualization of some of the connections of the amygdala and hippocampus .
20456928|In our recent studies using the inkblot stimuli , enlargement of the amygdala was revealed in association with frequent production of unique responses to the inkblot stimuli .
20456928|On the basis of these results , we hypothesized that the amygdala is involved in modulation of the connectivity among the frontotemporal regions identified in the activation analysis .
20456928|This analysis revealed that the amygdala imposed a positive modulation on the connection from the anterior prefrontal region to the temporopolar region , and a negative modulation on the connection from the temporopolar region to the occipitotemporal regions .
20459886|Altered microstructure integrity of the amygdala in schizophrenia : a bimodal MRI and DWI study .
20459886|BACKGROUND : The amygdala plays a central role in the fronto-limbic network involved in the processing of emotions .
20459886|Structural and functional abnormalities of the amygdala have recently been found in schizophrenia , although there are still contradictory results about its reduced or preserved volumes .
20459886|METHOD : In order to address these contradictory findings and to further elucidate the possibly underlying pathophysiological process of the amygdala , we employed structural magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- and diffusion weighted imaging -LRB- DWI -RRB- , exploring amygdalar volume and microstructural changes in 69 patients with schizophrenia and 72 matched healthy subjects , relating these indices to psychopathological measures .
20459886|RESULTS : Measuring water diffusivity , the apparent diffusion coefficients -LRB- ADCs -RRB- for the right amygdala were found to be significantly greater in patients with schizophrenia compared with healthy controls , with a trend for abnormally reduced volumes .
20459886|Also , significant correlations between mood symptoms and amygdalar volumes were found in schizophrenia .
20459886|CONCLUSIONS : We therefore provide evidence that schizophrenia is associated with disrupted tissue organization of the right amygdala , despite partially preserved size , which may ultimately lead to abnormal emotional processing in schizophrenia .
20459886|This result confirms the major role of the amygdala in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and is discussed with respect to amygdalar structural and functional abnormalities found in patients suffering from this illness .
20478833|Asymmetrical use of eye information from faces following unilateral amygdala damage .
20478833|frederic.gosselin@umontreal.ca The human amygdalae are involved in processing visual information about the eyes within faces , and play an essential role in the use of information from the eye region of the face in order to judge emotional expressions , as well as in directing gaze to the eyes in conversations with real people .
20478833|However , the roles played here by the left and right amygdala individually remain unknown .
20478833|Here we investigated this question by applying the ` Bubbles ' method , which asks viewers to discriminate facial emotions from randomly sampled small regions of a face , to 23 neurological participants with focal , unilateral amygdala damage -LRB- 10 to the right amygdala -RRB- .
20478833|The findings have implications for the amygdala 's role in emotion recognition and gaze direction during face processing .
20493671|Functional connectivity between ventral prefrontal cortex and amygdala at low frequency in the resting state in bipolar disorder .
20493671|lara.chepenik@yale.edu Trait abnormalities in bipolar disorder -LRB- BD -RRB- within the ventral prefrontal cortex -LRB- vPFC -RRB- and the amygdala suggest dysfunction in their connectivity .
20493671|This study employed low frequency resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- LFRS-fMRI -RRB- to analyze functional connectivity between the vPFC and the amygdala in BD .
20493671|LFRS-fMRI identified a negative correlation in vPFC-amygdala activity , and the magnitude of this correlation was greater in healthy participants than in subjects with BD .
20494265|OBJECTIVE : The amygdala and hippocampus are key components of the neural system mediating emotion perception and regulation and are thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of autism .
20494265|Although some studies in children with autism suggest that there is an enlargement of amygdala and hippocampal volume , findings in adolescence are sparse .
20494265|METHOD : We measured amygdala and hippocampus volume in a homogeneous group of adolescents with autism -LRB- 12 through 18 years ; n = 23 -RRB- and compared them with an age - , sex - , and IQ-matched control group -LRB- n = 29 -RRB- using a validated automated segmentation procedure in 1.5-T magnetic resonance images .
20494265|Post-hoc analysis showed that the right amygdala and left hippocampus were significantly enlarged -LRB- p = .010 ; p = .015 -RRB- in the autism compared with the control group .
20494265|There were no significant correlations between age and amygdala or hippocampus volume .
20494265|CONCLUSIONS : The abnormal enlargement of the amygdala and hippocampus in adolescents with autism adds to previous findings of enlargement of these structures in children with autism .
20497231|Age and genotype interacted in the left amygdala , in which the predicted effect of genotype on responses to rejection stimuli was seen in the adults , but not in the adolescents .
20498343|Coinciding with this sustained hippocampal activation , the amygdala , insula , anterior cingulate , and fusiform gyrus showed greater activation during the suppression of negative memories than during suppression of neutral memories .
20510373|Aversive stimuli lead to differential amygdala activation and connectivity patterns depending on catechol-O-methyltransferase Val158Met genotype .
20510373|However , studies on COMT-genotype effects on activity of the amygdala , a brain region centrally involved in affective processing , have yielded inconsistent results .
20510373|Here we investigated the impact of the COMT Val158Met polymorphism on amygdala activity and connectivity during processing of emotional and neutral pictures using functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- in 56 healthy participants .
20510373|Homozygosity for the low-activity Met allele was positively correlated with increased activation in the right amygdala in response to unpleasant , but not pleasant pictures .
20510373|In addition , the Met allele exerted an additive effect on the positive connectivity between the right amygdala and orbitofrontal regions .
20510373|Our results support previous reports of a COMT-genotype-dependent difference in amygdala responsivity as well as connectivity , and highlight the importance of naturally occurring genetic variations in the catecholaminergic system for neural activity underlying affective processing .
20512377|The VEN-containing regions connect to the frontal pole as well as to other parts of frontal and insular cortex , the septum , and the amygdala .
20515226|Highly arousing emotions were associated with increased BOLD signal intensities in the left thalamus , globus pallidus , caudate , parahippocampal gyrus , amygdala , premotor cortex , and cerebellar vermis .
20520767|More critically , during animal negative valence scenes , they had decreased amygdala activation and increased activation of the lingual gyri , the left cuneus , the posterior cingulate cortex and several areas mainly located in the frontal lobes , including the ACC , the IFG and the middle frontal gyrus .
20525743|The present fMRI study of script-driven imagery in 20 women demonstrates that social E-P , independent of valence , more strongly recruits brain regions involved in social - and self-referential processing , specifically the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex , posterior cingulate/precuneus , bilateral temporal poles , bilateral temporoparietal junction and right amygdala .
20535125|Our results showed age was positively correlated with the activation of right occipital fusiform gyrus and amygdala , and negatively correlated with the activation of right insula and inferior frontal gyrus .
20537659|Deep brain stimulation of the amygdala alleviates post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms in a rat model .
20537659|Recently , functional neuroimaging studies have suggested that amygdala hyperactivity is responsible for the symptoms of PTSD .
20537659|We tested whether DBS of the amygdala could be used to treat PTSD symptoms .
20537659|10 Sprague-Dawley rats underwent the placement of an electrode in the right basolateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- BLn -RRB- .
20541374|Hippocampus and amygdala volumes were measured by manual volumetry .
20541374|In comparisons of AD with MCI , rCBF was reduced in the posterior cingulum only , while profound rVOL reductions occurred in both right and left amygdala and in the right hippocampus , and as a trend , in the left hippocampus .
20541374|Brain volumes of the hippocampus and the amygdala were uncorrelated with the respective rCBF variables in both MCI and AD .
20541374|Hippocampal but not amygdalar volumes were associated with presence of one or two APOE epsilon4 alleles in MCI and mild AD , while there was no association of APOE epsilon4 allele with rCBF .
20546170|RESULTS : The VBM indicated significantly smaller regional gray matter volume in regions including the bilateral temporal polar and occipital cortices and the left amygdala in subjects with ADHD compared with controls .
20546170|Significantly smaller regional gray matter volumes were demonstrated in more extensive regions including the bilateral temporal polar cortices , bilateral amygdala , right occipital cortex , right superior temporal sulcus , and left middle frontal gyrus after controlling for the confounding effect of comorbid ODD and CD .
20553895|Second , there were longer-term effects : response reduction was found in the orbital/insular cortex for stimuli that were most versus least similar to the acoustic mean of all preceding stimuli , and , in the anterior temporal pole , the deep posterior STS and the amygdala , for stimuli that were most versus least similar to the trained voice-identity category mean .
20554871|Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 in the amygdala modulates pain-like behavior .
20554871|The central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- has been identified as a site of nociceptive processing important for sensitization induced by peripheral injury .
20554871|Finally , we present evidence of right hemispheric lateralization of mGluR5 modulation of amygdalar nociceptive processing .
20554871|We demonstrate that unilateral pharmacological activation of mGluR5 in the CeA produces distinct behavioral responses depending on whether the right or left amygdala is injected .
20554871|We also demonstrate significantly higher levels of mGluR5 expression in the right amygdala compared with the left under baseline conditions , suggesting a potential mechanism for right hemispheric lateralization of amygdala function in pain processing .
20557486|Compared with soundscapes that evoked no -LRB- neutral -RRB- emotional response , those evoking a pleasant or unpleasant emotional response engaged an additional neural circuit including the right amygdala .
20598238|The group by time interaction revealed significant voxels in the right amygdala-hippocampus complex -LRB- p < 0.05 , family-wise error corrected by use of the bilateral amygdala and hippocampus mask image as a small volume -RRB- , indicating a posttreatment blood oxygen level - dependent signal decrease in the citalopram group .
20598238|CONCLUSION : These results indicate that serotonergic and noradrenergic antidepressants have a differential effect on brain activity , especially in the amygdala and hippocampus .
20599362|Compared with viewing neutral faces , and irrespective of group , citalopram enhanced left anterior cingulate blood oxygen level dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- response to happy faces , right posterior insula and right lateral orbitofrontal responses to sad faces , and reduced amygdala responses bilaterally to fearful faces .
20599842|Parallel anxiolytic-like and antinociceptive actions of diazepam in the anterior basolateral amygdala and dorsal periaqueductal gray .
20599842|OBJECTIVE : This study was conducted to analyze the relationship between the anxiolytic-like and antinociceptive effects of diazepam when injected into the anterior basolateral amygdala -LRB- ABLA -RRB- and the dorsal periaqueductal gray -LRB- dPAG -RRB- .
20600336|Right prefrontal HF-rTMS attenuates right amygdala processing of negatively valenced emotional stimuli in healthy females .
20600336|In this fMRI study , we focused on lateralized amygdala functioning when processing salient emotional visual stimuli after one high-frequency -LRB- HF -RRB- - rTMS session .
20600336|In a ` uniform sample ' of 20 right-handed , non-depressed , healthy female subjects we examined whether one HF-rTMS session applied to the left -LRB- n = 10 -RRB- or right -LRB- n = 10 -RRB- dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- would influence amygdala responses to positively and negatively valenced baby faces .
20600336|Whereas one left-sided HF-rTMS session did not affect amygdala processing of the positive or negative stimuli , after a single right-sided HF-rTMS session we found a significant right amygdala activity attenuation during the processing of negatively valenced baby faces .
20600646|In a separate experiment we explored focal seizure -LRB- afterdischarge -RRB- threshold as well as seizure propagation rates in treated rats , using a 25 consecutive day standard amygdala kindling paradigm .
20619317|We identified that the two most important brain areas were the right nodule and right uvula , following acupuncture at PC6 , and the right amygdala and right inferior parietal lobe following , acupuncture at PC7 .
20620879|Conversely , activity in a set of interrelated temporal lobe structures , including the amygdala , was attenuated as the level of fear increased when choosing to overcome fear .
20621741|Fredrik.ahs@psyk.uu.se The amygdala , situated in the anterior medial temporal lobe -LRB- MTL -RRB- , is involved in the emotional enhancement of memory .
20624690|Corticotropin-releasing factor in the rat amygdala differentially influences sensory-discriminative and emotional-like pain response in peripheral neuropathy .
20624690|The central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- is involved in processing and regulation of pain .
20624690|While the right CeA had a dominant role in modulation of pain-related responses in sham controls , left as well as right CeA contributed to pain modulation in neuropathic animals.PERSPECTIVE : An increase in free endogenous corticotropin-releasing factor in the central nucleus of the amygdala was accompanied by increased cutaneous hypersensitivity and decreased emotional painlike behavior in neuropathic animals .
20624690|This finding indicates that CRF in the amygdala may have differential effects on sensory and emotional aspects of neuropathic pain .
20630708|Neural markers of remission in first-episode schizophrenia : a volumetric neuroimaging study of the hippocampus and amygdala .
20630708|More specifically , significantly smaller hippocampal volumes but not amygdala volumes have been identified at onset in first-episode schizophrenia -LRB- FES -RRB- patients .
20630708|So , we examined the relationship between hippocampus and amygdala volumes and early remission status .
20630708|METHODS : We compared hippocampus and amygdala volumes between 40 non-remitted and 17 remitted FES patients and 57 healthy controls .
20630708|Groups did not differ in body , head , or amygdala volumes bi-laterally .
20634975|Decreases in metabolism in these regions were not associated with craving ; in contrast the voxel-wise SPM analysis identified significant correlations with craving in anterior orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- p < 0.005 -RRB- , amygdala , striatum and middle insula -LRB- p < 0.05 -RRB- .
20638303|Association between structural abnormalities and fMRI response in the amygdala in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy .
20638303|Sarah.Broicher@swissepi.ch OBJECTIVE : The goal of this study was to investigate whether dysplastic amygdalae show an impaired response as revealed by functional MRI -LRB- fMRI -RRB- .
20638303|T1 - , T2-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery -LRB- FLAIR -RRB- MRI sequences were assessed for the detection and categorisation of structural amygdalar abnormalities according to size and MR signal intensity .
20638303|Of the 25 patients , five patients had probable dysplastic amygdala -LRB- pDA -RRB- : two right - and three left-sided .
20638303|RESULTS : A fearful face paradigm led to significant amygdalar activation in all but one patient -LRB- p < 0.05 -RRB- .
20638303|In 15 -LRB- 60 % -RRB- of the patients amygdalar activation was found contralateral and in four -LRB- 16 % -RRB- ipsilateral to the side of seizure onset .
20638303|Bilateral amygdalar activation was registered in five -LRB- 20 % -RRB- patients .
20638303|In two patients with right-sided and one with left-sided pDA , fMRI activation was observed only in the contralateral amygdala .
20638303|In two out of three patients with left-sided pDA we found significant ipsilateral amygdalar fMRI-responses .
20638303|CONCLUSION : Unilateral pDA does not necessarily affect the amygdalar fMRI BOLD-response .
20655320|Association between amygdala response to emotional faces and social anxiety in autism spectrum disorders .
20655320|nkleinha@u.washington.edu Difficulty interpreting facial expressions has been reported in autism spectrum disorders -LRB- ASD -RRB- and is thought to be associated with amygdala abnormalities .
20655320|Further , within the ASD group , greater social anxiety was associated with increased activation in right amygdala and left middle temporal gyrus , and decreased activation in the fusiform face area .
20656041|nkleinha@u.washington.edu Recent evidence suggests that a rapid , automatic face detection system is supported by subcortical structures including the amygdala , pulvinar , and superior colliculus .
20656041|The control group exhibited additional significant responses in the right amygdala , right pulvinar , and bilateral superior colliculi .
20656041|In the direct group comparison , the controls showed significantly greater activation in the left amygdala , bilateral fusiform gyrus , right pulvinar , and bilateral superior colliculi .
20667170|BACKGROUND : The Met allele of the catechol-O-methyltransferase -LRB- COMT -RRB- valine-to-methionine -LRB- Val158Met -RRB- polymorphism is known to affect dopamine-dependent affective regulation within amygdala-prefrontal cortical -LRB- PFC -RRB- networks .
20667170|METHOD : We employed functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure activation in the amygdala , ventromedial PFC -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- and ventrolateral PFC -LRB- vlPFC -RRB- during sad facial affect processing in family members with BD -LRB- n = 40 -RRB- , MDD and anxiety disorders -LRB- n = 22 -RRB- or no psychiatric diagnosis -LRB- n = 25 -RRB- and 50 healthy controls .
20667170|RESULTS : Irrespective of clinical phenotype , the Val158 allele was associated with greater amygdala activation and the Met158 allele with greater signal change in the vmPFC and vlPFC .
20667170|Signal changes in the amygdala and vmPFC were not associated with disease expression .
20673548|k.thomaes@vumc.nl OBJECTIVE : Classic posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- is associated with smaller hippocampus , amygdala , and anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- volumes .
20678494|Integrated object-and-motion-dependent activation was found bilateral in inferior and middle temporal gyri , right superior temporal gyrus , right superior parietal lobule , left dorsal putamen , and right amygdala .
2068205|Both YM-14673 -LRB- 1 mg/kg -RRB- and TRH -LRB- 10 mg/kg -RRB- administered 15 and 30 min prior to electrical stimulation of the amygdala , respectively , significantly shortened the AD duration in full-kindled rats .
20688087|These investigations have typically aimed to either characterize the contributions of the amygdala and medial temporal lobe -LRB- MTL -RRB- memory system , replicating results in animals , or delineate the neural correlates of specific behavioral phenomena .
20688087|The meta-analysis revealed consistent clusters within bilateral amygdala , anterior hippocampus , anterior and posterior parahippocampal gyrus , the ventral visual stream , left lateral prefrontal cortex and right ventral parietal cortex .
20688087|The results within the amygdala and MTL support a wealth of findings from the animal literature linking these regions to arousal-mediated memory effects .
20688087|In particular , we propose that the amygdala interacts with these structures to promote enhancements in perceptual processing , semantic elaboration , and attention , which serve to benefit subsequent memory for emotional material .
20702500|We previously reported that crude threat cues -LRB- backward masked fearful faces -RRB- facilitate spatial attention through a network of brain regions consisting of the amygdala , anterior cingulate and contralateral visual cortex .
20709096|Finally , we examined the effects of 1 or 10days of 2-hour restraint on CRF and CRF receptor gene expression in the amygdala , hippocampus , frontal cortex , and hypothalamus in order to determine whether a temporal pattern of gene expression parallels the change in the behavioral response to stress .
20709096|The major findings of the present study are that 1 -RRB- restraint stress attenuates the increase in PPI caused by repeated testing in both WKY and BN rats , and BN rats are more sensitive to the effects of restraint on PPI than WKY rats , 2 -RRB- restraint-induced increases in corticosterone levels mirror the effect of restraint on PPI in WKY rats but not in BN rats , 3 -RRB- laterality effects on gene expression were observed for the amygdala , whereby restraint increases CRF gene expression in the left , but not right , amygdala , and 4 -RRB- some restraint-induced changes in CRF and CRF receptor gene expression precede changes in PPI while other changes coincide with altered PPI in a rat strain - and brain region-dependent manner .
20709330|RESULTS : In participants with anorexia nervosa , drinking chocolate milk in the hunger condition induced significant activations in the right amygdala and in the left medial temporal gyrus relative to healthy controls .
20709330|Activations located in the amygdala and in the extrastriate body area might reflect fear of weight gain , representing one of the core symptoms of anorexia nervosa .
20713504|As predicted , significant interactions between sex and the effect of puberty were observed in regions with high sex steroid hormone receptor densities ; sex differences in the right hippocampus , bilateral amygdala , and cortical gray matter were greater in more sexually mature adolescents .
20713504|Our results demonstrate puberty-related maturation of the hippocampus , amygdala , and cortical gray matter that is not confounded by age , and is different for girls and boys , which may contribute to differences in social and cognitive development during adolescence , and lasting sexual dimorphisms in the adult brain .
20718693|The activity of the hippocampus and amygdala nucleus was monitored with electroencephalogram -LRB- EEG -RRB- throughout 24 weeks posttransplantation .
20728872|Between-group differences in H , which was always reduced in the ASC group , were seen in most regions previously reported to be involved in autism , including cortical midline structures , medial temporal structures , lateral temporal and parietal structures , insula , amygdala , basal ganglia , thalamus , and inferior frontal gyrus .
20729768|Sex differences in the correlation of emotional control and amygdala volumes in adolescents .
20729768|We examined male and female adolescents -LRB- 8-18 years of age -RRB- that were scanned with structural brain MRI and looked for a correlation between volume of the right or the left amygdala and parent-reported ability of emotional control .
20729768|A sex difference was found in the correlation between emotional control and the corrected volume of the left amygdala -LRB- that is the amygdala volume adjusted for total cranial volume -RRB- .
20729768|In girls , smaller left amygdala volumes were associated with better emotional control .
20729768|In boys , larger left amygdala volumes were associated with better emotional control .
20729768|These findings suggest that healthy girls and boys show a difference in the correlation between parental reports of emotional control and the left amygdala volume .
20732901|The amygdala was also activated by emotion .
20732901|Furthermore , emotion increased functional connectivity between the vACC and activity in the amygdala and the dACC .
20733346|Additionally , there was no difference in activity of the amygdala .
20739018|We focused , on the basis of prior research , on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- , amygdala , and accumbens .
20740648|luigi.degennaro@uniroma1.it Microstructural analyses by MRI brain scans and by DTI analysis of MR images were used to investigate the possible relationship between deep gray matter structures -LRB- amygdala and hippocampus -RRB- and dreaming in healthy subjects .
20740648|Thirty-four subjects ranging in age 20s to 70s underwent to a MRI protocol for the assessment of volume and mean diffusivity -LRB- MD -RRB- in the amygdala and hippocampus and were asked to fill out a dream diary via audiotape recording upon morning awakening for two weeks .
20740648|Particularly , a higher MD of the left amygdala , reflecting a decreased microstructural integrity , was associated with shorter dream reports and lower scores on emotional load .
20740648|Bizarreness of dream reports was negatively correlated with the left amygdala volume and positively correlated with the right amygdala MD. .
20740648|These findings indicate some direct relationships between volumetric and ultrastructural measures of the hippocampus-amygdala complex and specific qualitative features of dreaming .
20808693|On the other hand , the predominant brain activation areas following exposure to urban scenic views in contrast with natural scenes included the middle and inferior occipital gyri , parahippocampal gyrus , hippocampus , amygdala , anterior temporal pole , and inferior frontal gyrus .
20809213|RESULTS : Whole-brain analysis showed significant group  emotion interactions in a right amygdala-hippocampal region and left fronto-striatal cortex .
20817488|We examined hippocampal , amygdalar and anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- volumes in female patients with recurrent familial pure depressive disorder -LRB- rFPDD -RRB- .
20817488|We used semi-automated software for magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- to measure the volumes of the hippocampus , amygdala , ACC and subgenual prefrontal cortex -LRB- SGPFC -RRB- in 15 female patients with familial recurrent major depression -LRB- MD -RRB- and 15 healthy female subjects .
20818541|Conscious and unconscious processing of fear after right amygdala damage : a single case ERP-study .
20818541|j.h.c.heutink@rug.nl In this study , we describe a 58-year-old male patient -LRB- FZ -RRB- with a right-amygdala lesion after temporal lobe infarction .
20818541|This indicates that intact right amygdala function is not necessary for aversive conditioning .
20818541|Previous studies have stressed the importance of the right amygdala for discriminating facial emotional expressions and for classical conditioning .
20818541|Our study suggests that the right amygdala is necessary for explicit recognition of fear , while implicit recognition of fear and classical conditioning may still occur following lesion of the right amygdala .
20823079|The activation of the striatal system under scopolamine challenge was accompanied by the activation of the amygdala .
20843875|Abnormally reduced dorsomedial prefrontal cortical activity and effective connectivity with amygdala in response to negative emotional faces in postpartum depression .
20843875|The authors examined activity in response to negative emotional faces in the dorsomedial pre-frontal cortex and amygdala , key emotion regulatory neural regions of importance to both mothering and depression .
20843875|A two-way analysis of variance was performed examining main effects of condition and group and group-by-condition interaction on activity in bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortical and amygdala regions of interest .
20843875|In depressed mothers , there was also a significant negative correlation between left amygdala activity and postpartum depression severity and a significant positive correlation between right amygdala activity and absence of infant-related hostility .
20843875|There was reliable top-down connectivity from the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex to the left amygdala in healthy , but not depressed , mothers .
20843875|CONCLUSIONS : Significantly diminished dorsomedial prefrontal cortex activity and dorsomedial prefrontal cortical-amygdala effective connectivity in response to negative emotional faces may represent an important neural mechanism , or effect , of postpartum depression .
20843875|Reduced amygdala activity in response to negative emotional faces is associated with greater postpartum depression severity and more impaired maternal attachment processes in postpartum depressed mothers .
20845228|tschacher@spk.unibe.ch To investigate the functional connectivity among amygdala , insula , and auditory cortex during affective auditory stimulation and its relevance for psychotherapy , the authors recorded , using functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- , the blood oxygenation level-dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- responses of these brain regions in 20 healthy adults while listening to affective sounds -LRB- laughing and crying -RRB- .
20845228|Associations between amygdalar and cortical regions , however , were negative ; specifically , activations of the left auditory cortex preceded decreases of the right amygdala .
20845228|This suggested that affect regulation using cognitive control may have been achieved through active inhibition of amygdalar structures by the cortex .
20851718|Identification of hyperactive intrinsic amygdala network connectivity associated with impulsivity in abstinent heroin addicts .
20851718|Resting-state functional connectivity MRI was employed to measure abnormalities in the intrinsic amygdala functional connectivity -LRB- iAFC -RRB- network activity and the Barratt Impulsive Scale , 11th version was used to measure impulsivity .
20851718|In the CN group , the left pre-somamotor area-amygdala connectivity was positively correlated , and right orbital frontal cortex-amygdala and precuneus-amygdala connectivity were negatively correlated with impulsivity scores .
20854918|Memory for reward location is enhanced even though acetylcholine efflux within the amygdala is impaired in rats with damage to the diencephalon produced by thiamine deficiency .
20854918|lsavage@binghamton.edu A rodent model of diencephalic amnesia produced by thiamine deficiency -LRB- pyrithiamine-induced thiamine deficiency -LSB- PTD -RSB- -RRB- was implemented to assess both changes in behavior and acetylcholine -LRB- ACh -RRB- efflux in the amygdala across four training sessions of a delayed alternation task .
20854918|Although ACh efflux in the amygdala increased during delayed alternation testing in all groups , the NOP-trained rats had a greater rise in training-related ACh release in the post-training period .
20854918|This suggests that increased amygdalar cholinergic activation is more critical for processing spatial information than episodic reward information .
20854918|These data correspond with the idea that cholinergic activation of the amygdala promotes processing in other neural systems .
20858472|We found that FA and ? -LRB- 1 -RRB- were significantly lower in the ASD group than in the control group in the white matter around left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- , posterior superior temporal sulcus/temporo-parietal junction , right temporal pole , amygdala , superior longitudinal fasciculus , occipitofrontal fasciculus , mid - and left anterior corpus callosum , and mid - and right anterior cingulate cortex .
20869122|Association between depression severity and amygdala reactivity during sad face viewing in depressed preschoolers : an fMRI study .
20869122|gaffreym@wustl.edu BACKGROUND : Previous research has indicated that symptom severity and amygdala reactivity during the viewing of facial expressions of emotion are related in depression .
20869122|A region of interest approach was used in order to examine the relationship between amygdala activation and depression severity .
20869122|RESULTS : Findings indicated that depressed preschoolers exhibited a significant positive relationship between depression severity and right amygdala activity when viewing facial expressions of negative affect .
20869122|The results suggest that , similar to older children and adults with depression , amygdala responsivity and degree of depression severity are related as early as age 3 .
20869847|Suicidal attempts and increased right amygdala volume in schizophrenia .
20869847|Physical volumetric measures were calculated for the lateral ventricles , thalamus , hippocampus , amygdala , caudate , putamen , pallidum and accumbens using an automatic segmentation method on T1-weighted high-resolution -LRB- voxel size 1  1  1mm -LRB- 3 -RRB- -RRB- images .
20869847|Multivariate and follow-up univariate ANOVAs revealed a selective increase in volume in the right amygdala of patients with a history of suicidality compared both to patients without such a history and HC .
20869847|Moreover , in the entire patient group increased right amygdala volume was related to increased self-aggression .
20869847|Our findings suggest that right amygdala hypertrophy may be a risk factor for suicide attempts in patients with schizophrenia and this could be relevant for suicide prevention .
20870689|We found a significant reduction in -LSB- -LRB- 11 -RRB- C -RSB- Ro15 4513 binding in the nucleus accumbens , parahippocampal gyri , right hippocampus and amygdala in the alcohol-dependent compared with the healthy control group .
20888391|Based on the Harvard-Oxford subcortical structural atlas we investigated the microstructure of grey matter nuclei such as the nucleus accumbens , the amygdala , the putamen , the pallidum and the thalamus .
20888391|The microstructure assessment of the amygdala and nucleus accumbens in TS revealed a significant difference for the left nucleus accumbens and the right amygdala .
20888391|The other pattern is characterized by the increase in radial diffusivity in the amygdala and the correlation between radial diffusivity in the nucleus accumbens and tic measures indicating potentially altered myelination .
20920513|The amygdala and decision-making .
20920513|For example , decision-making is believed to involve areas of the brain involved in emotion -LRB- e.g. , amygdala , ventromedial prefrontal cortex -RRB- and memory -LRB- e.g. , hippocampus , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -RRB- .
20920513|In this article , we will present findings related to the amygdala 's role in decision-making , and differentiate the contributions of the amygdala from those of other structurally and functionally connected neural regions .
20920513|Decades of research have shown that the amygdala is involved in associating a stimulus with its emotional value .
20920513|This tradition has been extended in newer work , which has shown that the amygdala is especially important for decision-making , by triggering autonomic responses to emotional stimuli , including monetary reward and punishment .
20920513|Patients with amygdala damage lack these autonomic responses to reward and punishment , and consequently , can not utilize `` somatic marker '' type cues to guide future decision-making .
20920513|Studies using laboratory decision-making tests have found deficient decision-making in patients with bilateral amygdala damage , which resembles their real-world difficulties with decision-making .
20920513|Additionally , we have found evidence for an interaction between sex and laterality of amygdala functioning , such that unilateral damage to the right amygdala results in greater deficits in decision-making and social behavior in men , while left amygdala damage seems to be more detrimental for women .
20920513|We have posited that the amygdala is part of an `` impulsive , '' habit type system that triggers emotional responses to immediate outcomes .
20920847|Absence of gender effect on amygdala volume in temporal lobe epilepsy .
20920847|This study evaluated the effect of gender on amygdala volume in patients with TLE-MTS .
20920847|Significant ipsilateral amygdala volume reduction was observed for patients with right and left TLE .
20920847|No gender effect on amygdala volume was observed .
20920847|Contralateral amygdalar asymmetry was observed for patients with right and left TLE .
20920847|Although no gender effect was observed on amygdala volume , ipsilateral amygdala volume reductions in patients with TLE might be related to differential rates of cerebral maturation between hemispheres .
20923694|Right prefrontal HF-rTMS resulted in impaired disengagement from angry faces , associated with decreased activation within the right DLPFC , dorsal anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- dACC -RRB- and left superior parietal gyrus , combined with increased activity within the right amygdala .
20927311|After treatment , patients ' glucose metabolism increased significantly in global brain areas : the right precentral gyrus , right middle frontal gyrus , right amygdala , right caudate body , right putamen , left middle frontal gyrus , left precentral gyrus , left insula , left parahippocampal gyrus , and left inferior frontal gyrus -LRB- All areas were significant at uncorrected p < 0.001 and cluster level corrected p < 0.05 -RRB- .
20934190|First , prior to treatment and relative to controls , patients exhibited overall reduced activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- , diminished discrimination between emotional and neutral items in the amygdala , caudate , and hippocampus , and enhanced responses to negative versus positive stimuli in the left anterior temporal lobe -LRB- ATL -RRB- and right dorsolateral PFC. Second , CBT-related symptom improvement in MDD patients was predicted by increased activity at baseline in ventromedial PFC as well as the valence effects in the ATL and dorsolateral PFC. Third , from pre - to post-treatment , MDD patients exhibited overall increases in ventromedial PFC activation , enhanced arousal responses in the amygdala , caudate , and hippocampus , and a reversal of valence effects in the ATL .
20939663|Valence dependent asymmetric release of norepinephrine in the basolateral amygdala .
20939663|Emerging evidence from literature on humans suggests the valence of emotionally laden environmental stimuli may dictate whether amygdala activation is greater in one hemisphere relative to the contralateral side .
20939663|However , only a paucity of animal studies attempt to unravel the mechanisms underlying the selective , valence-dependent initiation of activity in the amygdala of opposing hemispheres .
20939663|The present studies assessed whether exposure to positive or negative appetitive conditions in an operant learning task differentially impacts norepinephrine activation of the left versus right amygdala , respectively .
20939663|Norepinephrine concentrations in the left but not right basolateral amygdala were elevated in groups presented with a positive experience of an unexpected increase in food reward after bar pressing -LRB- p < .01 -RRB- , relative to respective controls .
20939663|In contrast , exposure to negatively valenced events involving a reduction in expected food rewards after bar pressing or presentation of a footshock during fear conditioning produced significant increases in norepinephrine output sampled from only the right but not left basolateral amygdala .
20939663|These findings demonstrate that the valence of a learning event is selective in initiating asymmetric activation of the basolateral amygdala .
20946960|Cognitive versus automatic mechanisms of mood induction differentially activate left and right amygdala .
20946960|mdyck@ukaachen.de The amygdala plays a key role in emotional processing .
20946960|The specific contribution of the amygdala during the experience of one 's own emotion , however , remains controversial and requires clarification .
20946960|There is a long-standing debate on hemispheric lateralization of emotional processes , yet few studies to date directly investigated differential activation patterns for the left and right amygdala .
20946960|Limited evidence supports right amygdala involvement in automatic processes of emotion and left amygdala involvement in conscious and cognitively controlled emotion processing .
20946960|The present study investigated differential contributions of the left and right amygdala to cognitive and automatic mechanisms of mood induction .
20946960|Using functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- , we examined hemispheric amygdala responses during two mood induction paradigms : a purely visual method presenting face stimuli and an audiovisual method using faces and music .
20946960|The left amygdala exhibited comparable activation levels for both methods .
20946960|The right amygdala , in contrast , showed increased activity only for the audiovisual condition and this activity was increasing over time .
20946960|The left amygdala showed augmented activity with higher intensity ratings of negative emotional valence .
20946960|The modulation of the left amygdala responses by subjective experience may reflect individual differences in the cognitive effort used to induce the mood .
20946960|Thus , the central role of the amygdala may not be restricted to the perception of emotion in others but also extend into processes involved in regulation of mood .
20946962|Regardless of task , stronger activation to threatening vs. neutral pictures was found in several regions such as the amygdala , anterior insula , anterior cingulate cortex , primary somatosensory cortex and medial prefrontal cortex .
20950283|This phobia group also presented a lower activity peak in the left amygdala compared with spider phobics .
20950283|Importantly , looking at the dynamics of BOLD responses , both phobia groups showed a quicker time-to-peak in the right amygdala than controls , but only spider phobics also differed from controls in this parameter within the left amygdala .
20952166|People with autistic spectrum disorders -LRB- ASD , including Asperger syndrome -RRB- may have developmental abnormalities in the amygdala-hippocampal complex -LRB- AHC -RRB- .
20952166|The bulk volume of the amygdala and the hippocampus did not differ significantly between groups , but there was a significant difference in the effect of age on the hippocampus in controls .
20957557|Impaired recognition of fear in a Chinese man with bilateral cingulate and unilateral amygdala damage .
20957557|LJM , a 41-year-old schizophrenic Chinese man with bilateral anterior cingulate gyrus -LRB- Brodmann 's area 24 -RRB- lesions and also a small lesion in right amygdala after an operation , was compared with normal as well as brain-damaged and schizophrenic controls in identification of morphed facial expressions of six basic emotions .
20957557|The dissociation between recognition of fear and other emotions supported the view that the brain has separable networks for processing different emotions , and that the right amygdala as well as the anterior part of bilateral cingulate gyrus are possible substrates involved in the special network for perception of fear .
20964954|Trait dissociation as measured by the Dissociative Experiences Scale correlated negatively with the right amygdala and the left putamen .
20964954|Correlational analyses lend support to cortical hyperinhibition of the amygdala as a function of dissociation .
20974266|Against expectations no incongruence effects could be found in the amygdala .
20974266|Further analyses revealed that , independent of emotional valence congruency , the left amygdala was consistently activated when the information from both modalities was emotional .
20974266|If a neutral stimulus was present in one modality and emotional in the other , activation in the left amygdala was significantly attenuated .
20974266|Furthermore in audiovisual pairing amygdala responses seem to signal also the absence of any neutral feature rather than only the presence of an emotionally charged one .
21030008|Bipolar patients taking lithium displayed significantly increased hippocampal and amygdala volume compared with patients not treated with lithium and healthy comparison subjects .
21030482|Prior to forming face-behavior associations , a cluster in the right amygdala responded more strongly to untrustworthy than to trustworthy faces .
21030482|Interestingly , individual differences in the initial amygdala response to face trustworthiness prior to learning modulated the relationship between dmPFC activity and learning .
21030482|This finding suggests that the activity of the amygdala can affect the interaction between dmPFC activity and learning .
21041620|Laterobasal amygdalar enlargement in 6 - to 7-year-old children with autism spectrum disorder .
21041620|CONTEXT : There is substantial imaging evidence for volumetric abnormalities of the amygdala in younger children with autism spectrum disorder -LRB- ASD -RRB- .
21041620|The amygdala can be divided into functionally distinct laterobasal , superficial , and centromedial subregions .
21041620|To date , we are not aware of any in vivo reports specifically assessing subregional amygdalar abnormalities in individuals with ASD .
21041620|OBJECTIVES : To evaluate alterations in subregional amygdalar morphology in children with ASD compared with typically developing -LRB- TD -RRB- children and to examine the relationships with ASD symptom severity .
21041620|DESIGN : A cross-sectional study encompassing a narrow age range of children with ASD and age-matched TD children that evaluated magnetic resonance imaging-defined subregional morphology of the amygdala using a novel subregional analytic method .
21041620|MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Volume and subregional measures of the amygdala and measures of social and communication functioning .
21041620|RESULTS : The ASD group exhibited larger right and left amygdalae , by 12.7 % and 11.0 % , respectively , relative to the TD group .
21041620|Subregional analysis revealed that the ASD group had enlarged laterobasal amygdalar subregions , relative to the TD group , after adjusting for age , sex , and hemispheric cerebral volume -LRB- P < .05 , false discovery rate corrected and with clustered surface points > 15 -RRB- .
21041620|CONCLUSION : The current study demonstrates bilateral enlargement of laterobasal subregions of the amygdala in 6 - to 7-year-old children with ASD and that subregional alterations are associated with deficits in social and communicative behavior .
21047879|OBJECTIVE : The purpose of the study was to clarify the significance of amygdalar enlargement -LRB- AE -RRB- in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy -LRB- TLE -RRB- detected by MRI .
21047879|Enlarged amygdalae showed iso - to slightly high intensity in FLAIR images without enhancement .
21047879|Unilateral AE was not seen in the other three groups for amygdalar volume and LI -LRB- p < 0.05 -RRB- .
21050725|Activation in the amygdala , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- , and right temporal pole depended on mood state .
21051038|Functional magnetic resonance imaging brain activation in bipolar mania : evidence for disruption of the ventrolateral prefrontal-amygdala emotional pathway .
21054920|The labelling deficit was related to increased recruitment of the right amygdala , left inferior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex .
21054920|These results indicate that accessing semantic knowledge about negative information triggers increased amygdala and left inferior frontal gyrus processing , which subsequently impairs task-relevant behaviour .
21056631|The objective of this study was to develop a reliable method for the shape analysis of the amygdala , a structure that is important in gaining a better understanding of the limbic system in the human brain .
21056631|The goal of this study was threefold ; to develop -LRB- 1 -RRB- a robust method for aligning the contour of the amygdala ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- a reproducible method for extracting surface parameters of the amygdala using a spherical mapping technique ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- a standardized approach for statistical assessment and visualization of shape alterations by applying the probabilistic maps of amygdalar subregions .
21056631|This technique was validated by conducting an artificial phantom study and by assessing sex-related amygdalar shape differences using T1-weighted images from healthy volunteers .
21056631|In the human study , the average radii of the centromedial -LRB- CM -RRB- subregion in the left amygdala and laterobasal -LRB- LB -RRB- , superficial -LRB- SF -RRB- and CM subregions in the right amygdala were different between sexes -LRB- t-tests , p = 0.02 , 0.04 , 0.04 , and 0.002 , respectively -RRB- .
21056631|In addition , focal regions with larger radii in amygdalae of men than those of women were found predominantly on the surfaces of bilateral SF and bilateral CM subregions , after the volumes of the amygdala had been scaled to the unit volume -LRB- 1000mm -LRB- 3 -RRB- -RRB- -LRB- Mann-Whitney U-test , false discovery rate corrected p < 0.05 , clustered vertex points > 25 -RRB- .
21056631|Regions with smaller radii in amygdalae of men were found predominantly on the anterior surfaces of the right LB and SF subregions -LRB- Mann-Whitney U-test , false discovery rate corrected p < 0.05 , clustered vertex points > 25 -RRB- .
21056631|The current method may be used for measuring subtle local shape changes of the amygdala in various psychiatric or neurologic disorders .
21059346|Effects of spatial frequency and location of fearful faces on human amygdala activity .
21059346|The amygdala has previously been reported to be preferentially responsive to low-spatial frequency -LRB- LSF -RRB- rather than to high-spatial frequency -LRB- HSF -RRB- filtered images of faces presented at the center of the visual field .
21059346|Furthermore , it has been proposed that the amygdala might be especially sensitive to affective stimuli in the periphery .
21059346|In the present study we investigated the impact of spatial frequency and stimulus eccentricity on face processing in the human amygdala and fusiform gyrus using functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- .
21059346|In contrast to previous findings , we found that the amygdala responds to LSF and HSF stimuli in a similar manner regardless of the location of the affective stimuli in the visual field .
21059346|Our findings argue against the view that LSF information plays a crucial role in the processing of facial expressions in the amygdala and of a higher sensitivity to affective stimuli in the periphery .
21066884|Meanwhile , ALFF in brain areas of left temporal pole , superior temporal gyrus , mid-temporal gyrus , uncus , bilateral forepart of callosal gyrus , right amygdala , right inferior gyri orbitales were decreased by Ac , also showing significant difference between ST36 Ac and non-acupoint Ac -LRB- P < 0.05 -RRB- .
21073483|Preprocessing and statistical analyses , covaried for age , were conducted in SPM99 using a search territory that included superior , middle , and inferior frontal gyri -LRB- trigone region -RRB- , anterior cingulate gyrus -LRB- CG -RRB- , and left and right amygdala .
21075146|Functional lateralization of the baso-lateral amygdala neural circuits modulating the motivated exploratory behaviour in rats : role of histamine .
21075146|In this work the participation of the baso-lateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- on lateralized motivated exploratory behaviour and the possible influence of histamine neurons in these mechanisms were studied in rats .
21075146|In the APM , lidocaine treatment increased equally the exploration of the `` single wall '' and `` high and low walls '' arms of the labyrinth , independently if blocking of electrical activity of the BLA neurons was performed in the left or right amygdala .
21075146|In conclusion , present evidence support the lateralized participation of the amygdala on exploratory behaviour and histamine neurons appear to mediate part of these differential modulations .
21075229|An exploratory connectivity analysis showed that activity in these prefrontal regions was linked and was also associated with activity in brain regions typically responding to threat , the right anterior insula and amygdala .
2108014|We postulate that the subcortical hypometabolism is secondary to decreased efferent activity from temporal lobe structures , in particular amygdala and hippocampus , to subcortical nuclei .
21081170|Evidence for a general face salience signal in human amygdala .
21081170|andreia.santos@zi-mannheim.de In the social neuroscience of face processing , multiple roles are attributed to amygdala : signalling of fear/threat-stimuli , of emotional expression , and general salience .
21081170|The current study aimed at a direct comparison of amygdala activation attributable to these conditions by contrasting amygdala responses to matched emotional -LRB- threatening and non-threatening -RRB- and of non-emotional salient faces in a visual search paradigm using cartoon faces .
21081170|While significant amygdala activation was obtained for all trials with salient faces -LRB- compared to those containing only non-target faces -RRB- , no significant differences in activation emerged between emotional threatening , emotional non-threatening , and non-emotional targets .
21081170|Moreover , right and left amygdala activation for target trials was found correlated to the behavioural measure of target detection .
21081170|These findings provide evidence for a general role of the amygdala in signalling salience in a visual search independent of modality .
21081170|Given the critical involvement of the amygdala in several neuropsychiatric disorders , the current findings may contribute to further our understanding on dysfunctional neural circuits in these disorders .
21088708|Several studies have investigated the neural responses triggered by emotional pictures , but the specificity of the involved structures such as the amygdala or the ventral striatum is still under debate .
21088708|As expected , unpleasant pictures strongly activated the right and left amygdala , the right hippocampus , and the medial occipital lobe , whereas pleasant pictures elicited significant activations in left occipital regions , and in parts of the medial temporal lobe .
21088708|The direct comparison of unpleasant and pleasant pictures , which were comparable in arousal clearly indicated stronger amygdala activation in response to the unpleasant pictures .
21088708|Most important , correlational analyses revealed on the one hand that the arousal of unpleasant pictures was significantly associated with activations in the right amygdala and the left caudate body .
21088708|These findings support the notion that the amygdala is primarily involved in processing of unpleasant stimuli , particularly to more arousing unpleasant stimuli .
21093493|In an effort to reconcile these findings we measured hippocampal , amygdala and 3rd ventricle shapes in 26 schizophrenic patients -LRB- 10 PNS , 7 PHS , 9 NNS -RRB- and 12 healthy controls matched for age and gender .
21093493|Proportional deformations of the right medial amygdala , a key segment of this neurocircuit , were seen in both polydipsic groups , and correlated with the volume of the 3rd ventricle , which lies adjacent to the neuroendocrine nuclei .
21103008|Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia jointly contributed to clusters in the right hemisphere , but schizophrenia was almost exclusively associated with additional gray matter deficits -LRB- left insula and amygdala -RRB- in the left hemisphere .
21103008|However , relative to neurotypical controls , lower gray matter volume in schizophrenia is more extensive and includes the amygdala .
21106206|Exposure to a brief inescapable foot shock led to a volume reduction in both left HPC and right central amygdala two months later .
21106206|Together these data demonstrate that traumatic experience in mice causes a reduction in HPC and central amygdala volume possibly due to a shrinkage of axonal protrusions .
21106607|Diazepam attenuated the activation of right amygdala and right orbitofrontal cortex and enhanced the activation of right anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- to fearful faces .
21106607|These results suggest that benzodiazepines can differentially modulate brain activation to aversive stimuli , depending on the stimulus features and indicate a role of amygdala and insula in the anxiolytic action of benzodiazepines .
21108955|It has been reported that bilateral amygdala damage in humans compromises the recognition of fear and anger in nonverbal vocalizations -LRB- Scott et al. , 1997 -RRB- .
21108955|To focus more narrowly on the role of amygdala subparts , we differentiated patients with complete amygdala damage vs. damage limited to the basolateral complex of the amygdala .
21108955|The results confirmed for the first time that unilateral amygdala lesion including the basolateral complex can selectively impair recognition of fear and surprise expressed by voices , supporting the notion that the amygdala is a multimodal structure .
21108955|Interestingly , this impairment was observed in patients with incomplete resection of the amygdala that spared the central nucleus and the corticomedial complex , suggesting that a resection of the basolateral complex is sufficient to affect fear recognition .
21111829|Hunger modulated the response to food pictures in the right amygdala and left lateral OFC , and energy content modulated the response in the hypothalamus/ventral striatum .
21116109|As our primary interest was evaluating the potential role of 5?R in forebrain regulation of reproductive behavior , we quantified 5?R2 expression in the preoptic area , amygdala -LRB- AMY -RRB- , and ventromedial hypothalamus -LRB- VMH -RRB- .
21118656|c.eckart@uke.de BACKGROUND : So far , the neural network associated with posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- has been suggested to mainly involve the amygdala , hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex .
21121975|To investigate the potential for local effects of this enzyme in reproductive behaviour , we used in situ hybridisation for aromatase mRNA to examine expression during the BS and nonbreeding season -LRB- NBS -RRB- in areas of the brain that control male sexual behaviours -LSB- preoptic area -LRB- POA -RRB- and amygdala -LRB- AMY -RRB- -RSB- , as well as one regulating female reproductive behaviours ventromedial hypothalamus -LRB- VMH -RRB- .
21122994|Enhanced transport of Mn -LRB- 2 + -RRB- were found in the anterior cingulate cortex , midcingulate cortex , retrosplenial cortex , ventral medial caudate-putamen , nucleus accumbens , and amygdala in the noxious-stimulated group .
21122994|Enhancements in the anterior cingulate cortex , midcingulate cortex , ventral medial caudate-putamen , nucleus accumbens , and amygdala , but not the retrosplenial cortex , were attenuated by an intraperitoneal injection of morphine -LRB- 5mg/kg and 1mg/kg/h , intraperitoneal -RRB- .
21126995|Finally , by using a voxel-based statistical mapping method to identify lesions associated with a greater severity of anosognosia , we found that damage to the insula -LRB- particularly its anterior part -RRB- and adjacent subcortical structures was determinant for anosognosia for hemiplegia in the hyperacute period , while additional lesions in the premotor cortex , cingulate gyrus , parietotemporal junction and medial temporal structures -LRB- hippocampus and amygdala -RRB- were associated with the persistence of anosognosia for hemiplegia in the subacute phase .
21127721|Enhanced right amygdala activity in adolescents during encoding of positively valenced pictures .
21127721|vasa@kennedykrieger.org While studies among adults implicate the amygdala and interconnecting brain regions in encoding emotional stimuli , few studies have examined whether developmental changes occur within this emotional-memory network during adolescence .
21127721|The present study examined whether adolescents and adults differentially engaged the amygdala and hippocampus during successful encoding of emotional pictures , with either positive or negative valence .
21127721|Age group differences in brain activity in the amygdala and hippocampus during encoding of the pictures that were later successfully and unsuccessfully recalled were separately compared for the positive and negative pictures .
21127721|Adolescents , relative to adults , demonstrated enhanced activity in the right amygdala during encoding of positive pictures that were later recalled compared to not recalled .
21127721|There were no age group differences in amygdala or hippocampal activity during successful encoding of negative pictures .
21127721|The findings of preferential activity within the adolescent right amygdala during successful encoding of positive pictures may have implications for the increased reward and novelty seeking behavior , as well as elevated rates of psychopathology , observed during this distinct developmental period .
21128874|roger.jou@yale.edu OBJECTIVE : This study indirectly tested the hypothesis that individuals with autism spectrum disorders -LRB- ASDs -RRB- have impaired neural connections between the amygdala , fusiform face area , and superior temporal sulcus , key processing nodes of the ` social brain ' .
21128874|These findings provide preliminary support for aberrant neural connectivity between the amygdala , fusiform face area , and superior temporal sulcus-temporal lobe structures critical for normal social perception and cognition .
21129938|Using high-resolution MRI , we tested the hypothesis that adult ADHD patients exhibit gray and/or white matter volume -LRB- GMV , WMV -RRB- abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- , cingulate cortex -LRB- CC -RRB- , hippocampus and amygdala , also evaluating putative associations between volumetric data and symptoms of ADHD .
21129938|We found significantly smaller GMV in the right and left anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- but no GMV/WMV difference in the PFC , hippocampus and amygdala .
21140464|In a preliminary diffusion tensor imaging study of the connections of FI , we found that the VEN-containing regions connect with the frontal pole as well as with other parts of frontal and insular cortex , the septum , and the amygdala .
21146506|Among overweight/obese the associations between GM ADC and fibrinogen were significantly positive -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- in the left and right amygdala and the right parietal region .
21162046|Men displayed greater stress-related activations in the mPFC , rostral ACC , posterior insula , amygdala , and hippocampus than women , whereas women showed greater alcohol-cue-related activity in the superior and middle frontal gyrus -LRB- SFG/MFG -RRB- than men .
21172325|Reliable patterns of overlap included the superior temporal sulcus , anterior temporal lobe , lateral inferior parietal cortex -LRB- angular gyrus -RRB- , posterior cingulate cortex , dorsomedial and ventral prefrontal cortex , inferior frontal gyrus , and the amygdala .
21195392|RESULTS : Patients demonstrated enhanced activation of left amygdala and right insula during the initial viewing of aversive stimuli .
21195392|The attempt to increase negative emotions resulted in enhanced activity in amygdala and insula , whereas no group differences were found .
21208749|Variant in oxytocin receptor gene is associated with amygdala volume .
21208749|Applying a manual tracing procedure to high-resolution structural magnetic resonance images , amygdala volumes were measured in 51 girls genotyped on OXTR rs2254298 -LRB- G > A -RRB- , a single nucleotide polymorphism associated with psychopathology .
21208749|Results of this study indicate that despite having greater gray matter volume , participants homozygous for the G allele were characterized by smaller volumes of both left and right amygdala than were carriers of the A allele .
21215733|The inversion effect for neutral and emotional facial expressions on amygdala activity .
21215733|sato@pri.kyoto-u.ac.jp Neuroimaging studies have reported activation of the amygdala in response to faces and emotional facial expressions .
21215733|The way in which visual facial information is processed in the amygdala remains , however , unknown .
21215733|Here we investigated amygdala activity during the presentation of upright and inverted facial expressions of neutral and fearful emotions by measuring functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- while healthy subjects passively viewed these stimuli .
21215733|The right amygdala was found to be more active in response to upright compared to inverted faces displaying both neutral and fearful emotions .
21215733|These results suggest that the amygdala is involved in configural/holistic visual processing for faces and emotional facial expressions .
21232571|Food pictures compared with scenery yielded bilateral activation in visual areas as well as in the left insula and amygdala in both conditions .
21232571|These data suggest that cognitive manipulations affect the response to food cues in the prefrontal cortex , in areas involved in the planning and control of motivated behaviors , while the amygdala and insula responded equally in both conditions , consistent with a more basic role in homeostatically driven appetitive behavior .
21235721|The further presence of right temporal lobe-amygdala involvement may have predisposed to specific sexual preoccupation in some patients .
21246665|Cognitive appraisal and life stress moderate the effects of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism on amygdala reactivity .
21246665|cedric.lemogne@egp.aphp.fr The short allele of the serotonin-transporter-linked promoter region -LRB- 5-HTTLPR -RRB- polymorphism is associated with increased amygdala activation in response to emotional stimuli .
21246665|Although top-down processes may moderate this association , available evidence is conflicting , showing the genotype influence on amygdala reactivity to be either decreased or increased during emotion regulation .
21246665|Because the effects of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism on amygdala reactivity are also conditional on self-reported life stress , differences in life stress exposure may account for this apparent discrepancy .
21246665|Here , we hypothesized that self-reported life stress would moderate the relationships between genotype , cognitive appraisal , and amygdala reactivity .
21246665|First , there was a genotype  condition interaction in the right amygdala : short allele carriers displayed increased amygdala activation and decreased functional connectivity with the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex in self-referential processing versus emotion labeling .
21246665|Second , in line with our hypothesis , there was a genotype  condition  stress interaction in bilateral amygdala the amygdala activation during self-referential processing was negatively correlated with self-reported life stress in short allele carriers and positively in individuals homozygous for the long allele , whereas an opposite pattern was observed during emotion labeling .
21246665|These results confirm that the influence of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism on amygdala reactivity is at least partially under cognitive control .
21256599|However , during successful encoding of positive words , patients exhibited a larger recruitment of a set of areas , comprising cingulate gyrus , right inferior - and left medial-frontal gyrus as well as the right anterior hippocampus/amygdala .
21261758|In addition , regions of close proximity were observed in the anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC ; nicotine and cocaine -RRB- and amygdala -LRB- alcohol , nicotine and cocaine -RRB- .
21266462|Neural responses to mortality threat were greater than to pain threat in right amygdala , left rostral anterior cingulate cortex , and right caudate nucleus .
21267363|Hypothesis-driven region-of-interest analysis revealed hypoactivation of right amygdala in HR subjects .
21273352|RESULTS : Our analysis revealed 2 large clusters of age-related metabolic decrease in the overall sample , 1 in the left orbitofrontal cortex and the other in the right temporolimbic region , encompassing the hippocampus , the parahippocampal gyrus , and the amygdala .
21276593|Childhood trauma history differentiates amygdala response to sad faces within MDD .
21276593|merdia.grant@vanderbilt.edu OBJECTIVE : Heightened amygdala reactivity to aversive stimuli in major depression is regarded as a core feature of the underlying physiology but individual differences in amygdala response may also arise secondary to persistent changes in limbic function during early neurodevelopment relative to stressors such as childhood trauma .
21276593|We sought to determine whether heightened amygdala response is a core feature of depression or a general risk factor for psychopathology secondary to early life stress .
21276593|RESULTS : We observed a robust positive correlation between physical abuse and right amygdala response .
21276593|A much weaker relationship with other forms of abuse and neglect was also found , suggesting differences between abuse subtypes and amygdala response .
21276593|Group differences in amygdala response suggest heightened reactivity was not characteristic of persons with depression in general but was true primarily in those with a significant history of abuse .
21276593|CONCLUSION : These findings suggest the relationship between childhood trauma and risk for depression is mediated by heightened amygdala response but varies by abuse type .
21277170|Subsequently , rats were kindled by daily electrical stimulation of the right amygdala as a model of temporal lobe epilepsy .
21284912|Manual segmentation of the amygdala was performed on a structural T1 image .
21284912|Both groups exhibited increased brain activity during the perception of emotional faces relative to neutral ones in multiple brain regions , including multiple prefrontal regions bilaterally , the right amygdala , right cingulate cortex and cuneus .
21284912|In schizophrenia , the severity of flat affect correlated significantly with neural activity in several brain areas including the amygdala and parahippocampal region bilaterally .
21284912|CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that many of the brain regions involved in emotional face perception , including the amygdala , are equally recruited in both schizophrenia and controls , but flat affect can also moderate activity in some other brain regions , notably in the left amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus bilaterally .
21284912|There were no significant group differences in the volume of the amygdala .
21284913|Volumetric measures of the hippocampus , the entorhinal cortex and the amygdala were obtained manually .
21291958|We observed that Neuroticism correlated negatively with regional activity of the middle frontal gyrus and precuneus ; Extraversion correlated positively with regional activity of the striatum , precuneus , and superior frontal gyrus ; Openness correlated positively with the thalamus and amygdala , and negatively with the superior frontal gyrus ; Conscientiousness correlated positively with regional activity of the middle frontal gyrus and correlated negatively with the cerebellum .
21292451|The effect of diagnosis , genotype and their interaction was examined in predefined volumes of interest in the basal ganglia , hypothalamus and amygdala extracted using SPM5 .
21292451|RESULTS : Carriers of the CACNA1C rs1006737 risk allele showed increased grey matter density in the right amygdala and right hypothalamus irrespective of diagnosis .
21296361|Heavy-cannabis users showed significantly smaller volumes of the right -LRB- p < 0.04 -RRB- and left -LRB- p < 0.02 -RRB- hippocampus , but no significant differences in the amygdala region compared to controls .
21304831|WS compared to TD showed reduced right amygdala activation during presentation of negative faces , as in the previous literature .
21308791|Neuropsychological performance and inflammatory markers in the blood were assessed at baseline and 1 year later together with amygdala and hippocampal volume as well as WML .
21308791|While there was no significant difference in MTL volume at baseline , the placebo group exhibited more atrophy for right amygdala and left hippocampus at follow-up .
21309440|Z-scored LORETA analysis showed increased current source densities -LRB- CSD -RRB- at the right amygdala in both subjects during the induced panic symptoms .
21309440|Yet , a very significant increase at the amygdala was found in both cases .
21309440|These findings show a major role of amygdalar hyperactivity in both fear-related conditions for the two patients , and are discussed in relation to existing models of PD in general .
21315628|In addition , wind-up pain also activated the sublenticular extended amygdala -LRB- SLEA -RRB- and the brain stem .
21315749|A negative correlation was observed between negative affectivity and activation of the amygdala , fusiform gyrus , insula and hippocampus .
21316204|Group comparisons demonstrated increased activity of the right amygdala in the sample of restrictive AN patients .
21316204|Our results are in support of other recently published functional imaging studies and point to a pivotal role of the right amygdala in AN .
21316204|The constellation of increased activity of the amygdala and decreased activity of the cingulate cortex likely represents parts of a negative feedback loop of emotional processing .
21316204|Disgust ratings correlated with the amygdala signal negatively , which points to the complex role of this structure within eating disorders .

Previous studies have observed a sex-dependent lateralization of amygdala activation related to emotional memory .
21316467|Specifically , it was shown that the activity of the right amygdala correlates significantly stronger with memory for images judged as arousing in men than in women , and that there is a significantly stronger relationship in women than in men between activity of the left amygdala and memory for arousing images .
21316467|Using a large sample of 235 male adolescents and 235 females matched for age and handedness , we investigated the sex-specific lateralization of amygdala activation during an emotional face perception fMRI task .
21316467|Performing a formal sex by hemisphere analysis , we observed in males a significantly stronger right amygdala activation as compared to females .
21316467|Our results indicate that adolescents display a sex-dependent lateralization of amygdala activation that is also present in basic processes of emotional perception .
21338692|Within the cocaine-dependent group , years of cocaine use were inversely associated with the volume of the bilateral middle frontal gyrus , left superior frontal gyrus , parahippocampus , posterior cingulate , amygdala , insula , right middle temporal gyrus and cerebellum .
21339052|We found a CPM effect characterized by an initial increased activation in the orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- and amygdala at 250-300 ms poststimulus , which was correlated with the extent of psychophysical pain reduction .
21339052|Our findings show that the prefrontal pain-controlling areas of OFC and amygdala increase their activity in parallel with subjective pain reduction under CPM , and that this increased activity occurs prior to reductions in activations of the pain sensory areas .
21339052|In conclusion , achieving pain inhibition by the CPM process seems to be under control of the OFC and the amygdala .
21339500|Local amygdala structural differences with 3T MRI in patients with Alzheimer disease .
21339500|OBJECTIVE : Histologic studies show that the amygdala is affected by Alzheimer disease -LRB- AD -RRB- pathology , and its medial aspect is the most involved .
21339500|We aimed to assess in vivo local structural differences in the amygdala of patients with AD using high-field MRI .
21339500|The radial atrophy mapping technique was used to reconstruct the 3-dimensional surface of the amygdala .
21339500|A digital atlas of the amygdalar nuclei was used to infer which nuclei were involved .
21339500|RESULTS : Both amygdalar volumes were significantly smaller in patients with AD -LRB- right 1,508 mm  , SD 418 ; left 1,646 , SD 419 -RRB- than controls -LRB- right 2,129 mm  , SD 316 ; left 2,077 , SD 376 ; p < 0.002 -RRB- .
21339500|CONCLUSIONS : We found in vivo local structural differences in the amygdala of patients with AD .
21344018|Of particular interest is the observed amygdala activity depending on the stimulated tooth that might indicate a role in somatotopic encoding .
21345342|In addition , selective modulations by either REAP or ESUP were found depending on the negative valence of scenes -LRB- medial fusiform gyrus , anterior insula , dmPFC -RRB- , and on their nonsocial -LRB- middle insula -RRB- or social -LRB- bilateral amygdala , mPFC , posterior cingulate -RRB- significance .
21345342|Furthermore , we observed a significant lateralization in the amygdala for the effect of the two different ER strategies , with a predominant modulation by REAP on the left side but by ESUP on the right side .
21356267|5-HTTLPR and COMTval158met genotype gate amygdala reactivity and habituation .
21356267|We observed an effect of 5-HTTLPR on right amygdala reactivity -LRB- s-carrier > l/l -RRB- and COMTval158met on left amygdala reactivity -LRB- met/met > val-carrier -RRB- .
21356267|We provide preliminary evidence that different amygdala habituation curves may partly underlie the differences between 5-HTTLPR and not COMT genotype groups .
21356315|Our longitudinal analyses revealed that , of the various grey matter regions investigated , males and females in the AD group and the aMCI group showed different patterns of decline over time compared to controls in the bilateral precuneus , bilateral caudate nucleus , right entorhinal gyrus , bilateral thalamus , bilateral middle temporal gyrus , left insula , and right amygdala .
21373203|rCBF increases -LRB- 5-10 % -RRB- representing post-surgical ongoing pain were identified bilaterally in a network including primary and secondary somatosensory , insula and cingulate cortices , thalamus , amygdala , hippocampus , midbrain and brainstem -LRB- including trigeminal ganglion and principal-sensory nucleus -RRB- , but not in a control region in visual cortex .
21376543|In contrast , in adolescents with DBD , those with high MVE exhibited decreased activation in the right amygdala , compared with those with low MVE .
21390505|Fronto-limbic dysfunction in mania pre-treatment and persistent amygdala over-activity post-treatment in pediatric bipolar disorder .
21390505|RESULTS : At baseline , for the angry face condition , PBD , relative to HC , showed reduced activation in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- VLPFC -RRB- and right caudate ; for the happy face condition , PBD showed increased activation in bilateral PFC and right amygdala and middle temporal gyrus .
21390505|Post-treatment , PBD showed greater activation in right amygdala relative to HC for both conditions .
21390505|Patients , relative to HC , exhibited greater changes over time in the right VLPFC and amygdala , left subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and left caudate for the angry face condition , and in right middle temporal gyrus for the happy face condition .
21391251|Cortical activation sensitive to distorted -LRB- vs. natural -RRB- finger postures was found-with right-hemispheric dominance-in the primary motor cortex , postcentral somatosensory areas , amygdala , and insula , and bilaterally in the putamen .
21394853|RESULTS : Relative to the rest condition , elderly nonanxious comparison subjects had increased rCBF during worry induction -LRB- WI -RRB- in the right insula , bilateral amygdala , and associative temporooccipital areas .
21394853|Elderly GAD subjects had increased rCBF during WI in the associative temporooccipital areas , but not in the insula or the amygdala .
21406158|The summary Asperger syndrome map indicated lower grey matter volumes in the bilateral amygdala/hippocampal gyrus and prefrontal lobe , left occipital gyrus , right cerebellum , putamen and precuneus compared with controls ; grey matter volumes were greater in more limited regions , including the bilateral inferior parietal lobule and the left fusiform gyrus .
21410483|Parcellated morphological data were obtained for following bilateral components of the BRS : rostral and caudal anterior cingulate cortex , insula , medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- , rostral and caudal middle and superior frontal gyri , amygdala and hippocampus as well as for 26 other bilateral neocortical regions .
21410483|Relapsers demonstrated lower volumes than controls in the majority of regions , while abstainers showed lower volumes than controls in the superior frontal gyrus , insula , amygdala , and hippocampus , bilaterally .
21414332|MarieAnne.Vanderhasselt@Ugent.be High frequency -LRB- HF -RRB- repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation -LRB- rTMS -RRB- of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- has been shown to induce an attentional bias towards threatening information in healthy adults , associated with decreased activation in the right DLPFC and increased activation in the right amygdala .
21414332|Therefore , the effects of a single placebo-controlled rTMS session of the right DLPFC is consistent with the effects of a disrupted prefrontal-amygdala circuitry .
21414332|The effects on attentional bias are largest in those participants reporting higher state anxiety scores , possibly because underlying amygdala activation is highest .
21414466|These investigations have typically aimed to either characterize the contributions of the amygdala and medial temporal lobe -LRB- MTL -RRB- memory system , replicating results in animals , or delineate the neural correlates of specific behavioral phenomena .
21414466|The meta-analysis revealed consistent clusters within bilateral amygdala , anterior hippocampus , anterior and posterior parahippocampal gyrus , the ventral visual stream , left lateral prefrontal cortex and right ventral parietal cortex .
21414466|The results within the amygdala and MTL support a wealth of findings from the animal literature linking these regions to arousal-mediated memory effects .
21414466|In particular , we propose that the amygdala interacts with these structures to promote enhancements in perceptual processing , semantic elaboration , and attention , which serve to benefit subsequent memory for emotional material .
21425397|Neuroimaging and neurological studies of emotion recognition have primarily focused on the ability to identify the emotion shown in static photographs of facial expressions , showing correlations with the amygdala as well as temporal and frontal brain regions .
21438079|Hippocampal but not amygdalar volume affects contextual fear conditioning in humans .
21438079|Further analyses showed that these results could not be explained by amygdalar volumes .
21438079|In contrast , the participant answers on the self-report measures were not significantly influenced by hippocampal or amygdalar , but by total brain volume , suggesting a role of cortical structures in these more cognitive evaluation processes .
21450935|Increased amygdalar and hippocampal volumes in elderly obese individuals with or at risk of cardiovascular disease .
21450935|DESIGN : Three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brain were analyzed by using automatic segmentation to measure volumes of the nucleus accumbens , globus pallidus , amygdala , putamen , caudate nucleus , thalamus , and hippocampus in 471 subjects -LRB- mean age : 74.4 y ; 56 % men -RRB- .
21450935|RESULTS : Obese subjects had larger left -LRB- P = 0.013 -RRB- and right -LRB- P = 0.003 -RRB- amygdalar volumes and a larger left hippocampal volume -LRB- P = 0.040 -RRB- than did normal-weight subjects -LRB- BMI < 25 -RRB- .
21450935|After correction for age , sex , smoking , hypertension , and pravastatin use , BMI was associated with left -LRB- ? = 0.175 , P = 0.001 -RRB- and right -LRB- ? = 0.157 , P = 0.001 -RRB- amygdalar volumes and with left hippocampal volume -LRB- ? = 0.121 , P = 0.016 -RRB- .
21450935|CONCLUSIONS : This study showed that the amygdala and hippocampus are enlarged in obesity .
21454920|METHOD : Voxel-based morphometry was used to compare gray matter volumes in four regions of interest -LRB- amygdala , insula , anterior cingulate , and orbitofrontal cortex -RRB- in male adolescents with early-onset -LRB- N = 36 -RRB- or adolescent-onset -LRB- N = 27 -RRB- conduct disorder and in healthy comparison subjects -LRB- N = 27 -RRB- .
21454920|RESULTS : The combined conduct disorder group displayed gray matter volume reductions in the bilateral amygdala , extending into the insula , relative to healthy comparison subjects .
21454920|Separate comparisons between healthy subjects and each conduct disorder subgroup revealed lower amygdala volume in both subgroups and reduced right insula volume in the adolescent-onset subgroup .
21458471|Compared to sighted controls , congenitally blind subjects more strongly activated primary -LRB- right amygdala -RRB- and secondary -LRB- right orbitofrontal cortex and bilateral hippocampus -RRB- olfactory areas .
21458960|Hippocampal and amygdalar volume changes in elderly patients with Alzheimer 's disease and schizophrenia .
21458960|We explored the patterns of hippocampal and amygdalar atrophy in those patients and their associations with clinical parameters .
21458960|Hippocampal and amygdalar volumes were obtained by manual segmentation with a standardized protocol and compared among groups .
21458960|In both schizophrenia and AD patients , left hippocampal and amygdalar volumes were significantly smaller .
21458960|The hippocampus/amygdala ratio was significantly lower in schizophrenia compared to both AD cases -LSB- 2.4 bilaterally , 95 % C.I. 2.2 to 2.7 -RSB- and healthy controls bilaterally -LSB- 2.5 , 95 % C.I. 2.3 to 2.9 in left and 2.7 , 95 % C.I. 2.4 to 3.1 in right hemisphere -RSB- .
21458960|In schizophrenia patients , a significant positive correlation was found between age at disease onset and the right hippocampus/amygdala volume ratio -LRB- Spearman rho = 0.56 -RRB- .
21458960|Negative symptoms correlated with higher right/left amygdala volume ratio -LRB- Spearman 's rho = 0.43 -RRB- .
21458960|Our data show that unlike AD , the hippocampus/amygdala ratio is abnormally low and correlates with the age at onset in schizophrenia , being a neurodevelopmental signature of the disease .
21464365|Participants with ASD were found to have robust decreases of gray matter volume in the bilateral amygdala-hippocampus complex and the bilateral precuneus .
21467047|We find that bonobos have more gray matter in brain regions involved in perceiving distress in both oneself and others , including the right dorsal amygdala and right anterior insula .
21467047|Bonobos also have a larger pathway linking the amygdala with the ventral anterior cingulate cortex , a pathway implicated in both top-down control of aggressive impulses as well as bottom-up biases against harming others .
21474316|We found that greater liberalism was associated with increased gray matter volume in the anterior cingulate cortex , whereas greater conservatism was associated with increased volume of the right amygdala .
21484952|The regions were amygdala , thalamus , and entorhinal cortex -LRB- identified as anomalous by prior studies on the same population -RRB- and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior insula -LRB- isolated by voxel-based morphometry analysis -RRB- .
21484952|We used structural equation modeling and found altered path coefficients connecting the thalamus to the anterior insula , the amygdala to the DLPFC , and the entorhinal cortex to the DLPFC .
21484952|Instead , controls showed positive entorhinal-DLPFC and negative amygdalar-DLPFC connections , both of which were absent in the clinical population .
2149428|Nuclear concentrations of -LSB- 3H -RSB- - MPA measured by HPLC in controls were highest in the hypothalamus , amygdala , preoptic area and pituitary gland .
21497657|Bidirectional communication between amygdala and fusiform gyrus during facial recognition .
21497657|Recent theories indicate that FG activity is shaped by input from amygdala , but effective connectivity from amygdala to FG remains undocumented .
21497657|Robust face-selective activation of FG , amygdala , and lateral occipital cortex were observed .
21497657|BMS results strongly favored a dynamic causal model with bidirectional , face-modulated amygdala-FG connections .
21497657|These findings suggest that amygdala strongly influences FG function during face perception , and that this influence is shaped by experience and stimulus salience .
21501165|RESULTS : In the first postpartum month , breastfeeding mothers showed greater activations in the superior frontal gyrus , insula , precuneus , striatum , and amygdala while listening to their own baby-cry as compared to formula-feeding mothers .
21501165|For both breastfeeding and formula-feeding mothers , greater activations in the right superior frontal gyrus and amygdala were associated with higher maternal sensitivity at 3-4 months postpartum .
21516202|Greater female local connectivity in the right hippocampus and amygdala was also noted , regardless of age .
21523563|Body weight and the reward system : the volume of the right amygdala may be associated with body mass index in young overweight men .
21523563|We aimed to investigate the relationship between BMI -LRB- body mass index -RRB- and the volumes of the structures of the reward system -LRB- hippocampus , amygdala , accumbens , caudatum , putamen , and orbitofrontal cortex -RRB- .
21523563|We found that the volume of the right amygdala positively correlated with the BMI in men but not in women .
21523563|The potential relationship between the volume of the right amygdala and the BMI in heavier individuals requires further studies with larger samples .
21525857|Neuropeptide-S -LRB- NPS -RRB- receptor genotype modulates basolateral amygdala responsiveness to aversive stimuli .
21525857|In animal models , NPS and its receptor -LRB- NPSR -RRB- were shown to be highly expressed in the amygdala , a central structure in the fear circuit , also known to be hyper-responsive in anxiety disorders .
21525857|However , the role of NPSR gene variation in the modulation of fear-related amygdala responsiveness remains to be clarified .
21525857|In 79 healthy subjects genotyped for NPSR rs324981 , amygdala responses were assessed by means of fMRI .
21525857|The participants were presented with fear-relevant faces in a robust emotion-processing paradigm frequently used to study amygdala responsiveness .
21525857|We observed a strong association of NPSR T-alleles with right amygdala responsiveness to fear-relevant faces .
21525857|We conclude that NPSR genotype is associated with increased amygdala responsiveness to fear-relevant stimuli .
21531077|Dosage-correlated volumetric decrease was observed primarily in the right amygdala .
21543002|Our results presented that acupuncture at different acupoints -LRB- or comparing with nonacupoint -RRB- can specifically induce neural responses in different brain areas-acupuncture at ST36 can specifically induce the neural responses of pain-inhibition areas , while acupuncture at PC6 can specifically induce the activities of the insula and amygdala .
21551226|The association between financial hardship and amygdala and hippocampal volumes : results from the PATH through life project .
21551226|Results showed that , after controlling for well-established risk factors for atrophy , adults who reported financial hardship had smaller left and right hippocampal and amygdalar volumes than those who did not report hardship .
21551226|Financial hardship may be considered a potent stressor and the observed results are consistent with the view that hardship influences hippocampal and amygdalar volumes through hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and other stress-related pathways .
21557893|RESULTS : Compared with HVs , patients with BN had a decreased neural response in the precuneus to facial expressions of both anger and disgust and a decreased neural response to angry facial expressions in the right amygdala .
21557893|The precuneus response may be consistent with the application of mentalization theory to EDs , and the amygdala response with relevant ED theory .
21557954|When deaf subjects imagined sounds , the left inferior frontal gyrus , the right posterior temporal gyrus and the right amygdala were less activated compared to controls .
21575012|METHODS : Children and adolescents -LRB- N = 28 , 6 to 17 years -RRB- diagnosed with FASD and 56 age - and sex-matched healthy controls -LRB- i.e. , 2 matched controls per FASD subject -RRB- underwent 3-dimensional T1-weighted MRI scans that were used for the automated volume measurement -LRB- FreeSurfer -RRB- of the intracranial space , total white matter , cortical gray matter , and 6 deep gray matter structures , namely the hippocampus , amygdala , thalamus , caudate , putamen , and globus pallidus , with left and right measured separately .
21575012|The hippocampus , thalamus , and globus pallidus showed reductions in all 3 age subgroups -LRB- 6 to 9 , 10 to 13 , and 14 to 17 years -RRB- but the caudate and putamen had smaller volumes for FASD only within the 2 youngest subgroups ; the amygdala was only smaller for FASD in the 2 oldest subgroups .
21576462|Independent of session , smokers homozygous for the wild-type OPRM1 A allele exhibited significantly higher levels of MOR BP -LRB- ND -RRB- than smokers carrying the G allele in bilateral amygdala , left thalamus , and left anterior cingulate cortex .
21576462|Among G allele carriers , the extent of subjective reward difference -LRB- denicotinized versus nicotine cigarette -RRB- was associated significantly with MOR BP -LRB- ND -RRB- difference in right amygdala , caudate , anterior cingulate cortex , and thalamus .
21592741|Greater pre-treatment right amygdala activity with negative and positive condition in the risperidone group , and left amygdala activity with positive condition in divalproex group , predicted poor response on YMRS .
21592741|Increased amygdala activity at baseline is a potential biomarker predicting poor treatment response to both the risperidone and divalproex .
21601177|RESULTS : Compared with LD , future Abstainers had smaller brain tissue volumes in the left amygdala , hippocampal head , and entorhinal cortex and bilaterally in the thalamus and adjacent subcortical white matter -LRB- WM -RRB- and had larger volume in the left lateral orbitofrontal region .
21601831|Vigilance for threat interacts with amygdala responses to subliminal threat cues in specific phobia .
21601831|judith.lipka@uni-jena.de BACKGROUND : The amygdala has been strongly implicated in the processing of threat-relevant information in specific phobia .
21601831|However , there is an ongoing debate as to whether the amygdala may also be engaged outside of conscious stimulus awareness .
21601831|Furthermore , considering that sustained vigilance for threat constitutes a crucial characteristic of specific phobias , we hypothesized a possible role of this symptom in modulating amygdala sensitivity to disorder-relevant cues .
21601831|Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging , we examined responses of the amygdala to subliminal and supraliminal phobogenic stimuli in spider-phobic subjects and whether these responses might be specifically associated with disorder-related hypervigilance .
21601831|RESULTS : Compared with control subjects , phobic participants showed stronger responses of both amygdalae to consciously perceived spiders versus nonspider targets , whereas during unconscious stimulus processing , enhanced activation was only apparent in the right amygdala .
21601831|Moreover , the intensity of disorder-related vigilance was positively correlated with right amygdala activation specifically during the subliminal condition .
21601831|CONCLUSIONS : These findings provide evidence for unconscious threat processing in specific phobia , with the magnitude of amygdala responses specifically potentiated by sustained hypervigilance for threat .
21618660|Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to test the main effects of the Geriatric Depression Scale -LRB- GDS -RRB- and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test delayed recall -LRB- RAVLT-DR -RRB- scores , and their interaction on the intrinsic amygdala functional connectivity -LRB- AFC -RRB- network activity .
21621549|This sleep-related reduction in forgetting did not differ between neutral and negative contexts , but there was a clear interaction between sleep and context valence at the functional level , with left amygdala , right parahippocampus , and other components of the episodic memory system all responding more strongly during correct memory for emotional contexts post-sleep .
21621549|Connectivity between right parahippocampus and bilateral amygdala/periamygdala was also enhanced during correct post-sleep attribution of emotional contexts .
21627621|METHOD : We assessed right anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- and amygdala-hippocampal region -LRB- Am + Hpp -RRB- N-acetyl-aspartate -LRB- NAA -RRB- , choline -LRB- Cho -RRB- and creatine -LRB- Cr -RRB- concentrations and NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr ratios using single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 15 patients with autogenous obsessions -LRB- OCD-A -RRB- , 15 patients with reactive obsessions -LRB- OCD-R -RRB- and 15 healthy controls -LRB- HC -RRB- .
21632648|By contrast , deficits in activation and connectivity of the ventral anterior cingulate and amygdala , areas previously implicated in regulating emotional conflict , were found in all patient groups .
21632648|CONCLUSIONS : These data support the existence of a common abnormality in anxiety and depression in the ventral cingulate and the amygdala , which may be related to a shared genetic etiology .
21640794|Multi-decade hippocampal and amygdala volume analysis : equal variability and limited age effect .
21640794|Hippocampal -LRB- HC -RRB- and amygdala -LRB- AG -RRB- variability throughout asymptomatic adulthood have not been often characterized .
21640839|ciara.mccabe@psych.ox.ac.uk Studies have revealed abnormalities in resting-state functional connectivity in those with major depressive disorder specifically in areas such as the dorsal anterior cingulate , thalamus , amygdala , the pallidostriatum and subgenual cingulate .
21640839|Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and seed based connectivity analysis we selected the right nucleus accumbens , the right amygdala , the subgenual cingulate and the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex as seed regions .
21640839|Despite no differences in mood across the three groups , we found reduced connectivity between the amygdala and the ventral medial prefrontal cortex in the citalopram group and the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex for the reboxetine group .
21646569|RESULTS : Compared with nonoffenders , violent offenders presented with a larger GM volume in the amygdala bilaterally , the left nucleus accumbens , and the right caudate head and with less GM volume in the left insula .
21651951|Hippocampus and amygdalar volumes in patients with somatization disorder .
21651951|Therefore , we aimed to use structural MRI to evaluate the hippocampus amygdalar complex which is associated with both stress and regulation of emotion that are main basis clinical presentation of somatization disorder in the patients with somatization disorder .
21651951|Intracranial volume -LRB- ICV -RRB- , whole brain volume , gray and white matter volumes , and hippocampus and amygdalar volumes of the subjects were measured .
21651951|In regard to unadjusted mean volumes of measured structures , the patients had significantly smaller mean volumes of the left and right amygdala .
21651951|The repeated measures ANCOVA predicting left and right amygdala volumes demonstrated a significant main effect of diagnostic group .
21651951|In conclusion , the findings of the present study revealed that the patients with somatization disorder had significantly smaller mean volumes of the left and right amygdala without any differences in regard to whole brain , total gray and white matter or hippocampus volumes .
21654968|The right amygdala too demonstrated significant deactivation .
21664935|Gender effects on amygdala morphometry in adolescent marijuana users .
21664935|This study examined the relationships between amygdala volume and internalizing symptoms in teenaged chronic marijuana users .
21664935|Reliable raters manually traced amygdala and intracranial volumes on high-resolution magnetic resonance images .
21664935|Female marijuana users had larger right amygdala volumes and more internalizing symptoms than female controls , after covarying head size , alcohol , nicotine and other substance use -LRB- p < 0.05 -RRB- , while male users had similar volumes as male controls .
21664935|For female controls and males , worse mood/anxiety was linked to smaller right amygdala volume -LRB- p < 0.05 -RRB- , whereas more internalizing problems was associated with bigger right amygdala in female marijuana users .
21664935|Subtle amygdala development abnormalities may underlie particular vulnerabilities to sub-diagnostic depression and anxiety in teenage female marijuana users .
21667303|In MCI patients , the meta-analysis revealed three significant clusters of convergent grey matter atrophy , which were mainly situated in the bilateral amygdala and hippocampus , extending to the left medial temporal pole and thalamus , as well as in the bilateral precuneus .
21667303|A voxel-wise analysis revealed a correlation between grey matter reduction and cognitive decline in the right hippocampus and amygdala as well as in the left thalamus .
21667304|Arguments supporting this segregation include differences in -LRB- i -RRB- connectivity : the DHipp is connected with the entorhinal cortex which receives visuospatial neocortical inputs ; the VHipp is connected with both the amygdala and hypothalamus , -LRB- ii -RRB- electrophysiological characteristics : there is a larger proportion of place cells in the DHipp than in the VHipp , and an increasing dorsoventral gradient in the size of place fields , suggesting less refined spatial coding in the VHipp , and -LRB- iii -RRB- consequences of lesions : spatial memory is altered after DHipp lesions , less dramatically , sometimes not , after VHipp lesions .
21675225|-LSB- Interaction of amygdalar neurons of active and passive rabbits in negative emotional situations -RSB- .
21675225|Interaction of basal and central nuclear neurons of amygdala was studied by plotting histograms of crosscorrelation in passive and active rabbits exposed to emotionally significant stimuli .
21675225|Intergroup differences were revealed in the interaction of neighboring cells of amygdala .
21675225|The asymmetry of the interhemispheric neuronal interaction in amygdala with the right dominance was revealed in passive but not active animals .
21675225|The results testify that amygdala is involved in the choice of behavioral strategy , and the level of its activation is higher in passive animals .
21676597|Cortex and amygdala morphology in psychopathy .
21676597|The study aim was to map local differences of cortical and amygdalar morphology .
21676597|Up to 30 % tissue reduction in the basolateral nucleus , and 10-30 % enlargement effects in the central and lateral nuclei indicated abnormal structure of the amygdala -LRB- corrected p = 0.05 on the right ; and symmetrical pattern on the left -RRB- .
21683728|Molecular and electrophysiological changes in the prefrontal cortex-amygdala-dorsal periaqueductal grey pathway during persistent pain state and fear-conditioned analgesia .
21683728|Projections along the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- - amygdala-dorsal periaqueductal grey -LRB- dPAG -RRB- pathway may mediate FCA .
21683728|Male Lister-hooded rats , with stimulating and recording electrodes implanted in the amygdala and dPAG , respectively , either received or did not receive footshock -LRB- 0.4 mA -RRB- paired with context , followed 23.5 h later by an intraplantar injection of saline or formalin -LRB- 50 ?L , 2.5 % -RRB- into the right hindpaw .
21683728|Thirty minutes post-formalin/saline , rats were re-exposed to the context for 15 min , during which pain-related behaviours were assessed in addition to evoked field potential recordings in the amygdala-dPAG pathway .
21683728|Together , these data suggest differential , state-dependent alterations in electrophysiological activity and ERK phosphorylation along the PFC-amygdala-dPAG pathway during pain , conditioned fear , and FCA .
21683947|It suggests that emotional responses to music can be at least partially preserved at a non-verbal level in patients with unilateral temporal lobe damage including the amygdala .
21689767|Whereas correlation analysis did not indicate any link between brain activation and extraversion , strong positive correlations between measures of neuroticism and hemodynamic responses of the right amygdala , the left postcentral gyrus as well as medial frontal structures including the right anterior cingulate cortex emerged , suggesting that brain mechanisms mediating the decoding of emotional speech melody may vary depending on differences in neuroticism among individuals .
21689772|Role of amygdala-prefrontal cortex circuitry in regulating the expression of contextual fear memory .
21689772|carl.stevenson@nottingham.ac.uk The basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- are inter-connected regions involved in fear memory expression .
21693631|Voxel based morphometry -LRB- VBM -RRB- , a technique that gives a probabilistic measure of local grey matter -LRB- GM -RRB- and white matter concentration , has been used to study ASD patients : modifications in GM volume have been found in various brain regions , such as the corpus callosum , brainstem , amygdala , hippocampus and cerebellum .
21693631|GM decreases were observed bilaterally in the cerebellar tonsil and inferior parietal lobule , in the right amygdala , insula , middle temporal gyrus , caudate tail and precuneus and in the left precentral gyrus .
21704307|RESULTS : Among the whole sample , anticipation of working for monetary reward -LRB- i.e. , reward anticipation -RRB- was associated with activation in the ventral striatum -LRB- VS -RRB- , medial frontal gyrus , thalamus , right subcallosal gyrus , right insula , and left amygdala .
21704307|In CD participants during reward anticipation , activation in left and right thalamus and right caudate correlated negatively with percent cocaine-negative urine toxicology , activation in thalamus bilaterally correlated negatively with self-reported abstinence measures , and activation in left amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus correlated negatively with treatment retention .
21705088|Automatic subcortical segmentations of the FreeSurfer pipeline were used to relate nucleus accumbens -LRB- NAcc -RRB- and amygdala volume to trait anxiety .
21709179|However , there has been surprisingly little investigation of whether the contributions of different MTL subregions -LRB- amygdala , hippocampus -LSB- HPC -RSB- , parahippocampal -LSB- PHc -RSB- , perirhinal cortex -LSB- PRc -RSB- , and temporal polar cortex -LSB- TPc -RSB- -RRB- shift across multiple presentations during associative encoding .
21709179|The classification analysis implicated right HPC and amygdala early in the task when the speed-up from trial to trial was greatest .
21709179|Right HPC and amygdala support active integration of object and location information , while right PRc and TPc are involved when object and spatial representations become unitized into a single representation .
21717780|RESULTS : During heroin-visual stimulation , the markedly activated brain areas -LRB- increase of blood oxygen level-dependent signal -RRB- of fMRI were bilateral middle frontal gyrus , left cingulate gyrus , bilateral insula , occipital cortex , left cuneus , cerebellum , bilateral thalamus , right hippocampus and right amygdala etc. which are closely related to the human 's craving psychological activities .
21733221|andrea.gold@yale.edu BACKGROUND : Neuroimaging research has demonstrated medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- hyporesponsivity and amygdala hyperresponsivity to trauma-related or emotional stimuli in post-traumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- .
21733221|In the current study , we sought to determine whether regional cerebral blood flow -LRB- rCBF -RRB- abnormalities in mPFC and amygdala in PTSD could be observed during the recollection of trauma-unrelated stressful personal events .
21733221|No differential amygdala activation was observed between groups or in either group separately .
21733287|We used blood oxygen level-dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- to measure neural activity in the dorsolateral -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- VLPFC -RRB- , orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- , ventral striatum and amygdala , using a region of interest -LRB- ROI -RRB- approach in SPM2 .
21750247|Implicit processing of emotional prosody engaged regions in the posterior superior temporal gyrus -LRB- pSTG -RRB- and bilateral IFG subregions , whereas explicit processing relied more on mid STG , left IFG , amygdala , and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex .
21750247|Furthermore , whereas some bilateral pSTG regions and the amygdala showed general sensitivity to prosody-specific acoustical features during implicit processing , activity in inferior frontal brain regions was insensitive to these features .
21752593|MRI amygdala volume in Williams Syndrome .
21752593|The amygdala has been consistently implicated in the etiology of this social profile , particularly given its role in emotional and social behavior .
21752593|This study examined amygdala volume and symmetry in WS individuals and in age and sex matched controls .
21752593|Magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained on a GE 1.5-T magnet with 1.5-mm contiguous slices and were used to measure whole gray matter , white matter and cerebrospinal fluid volumes , as well as amygdala volume -LRB- right and left -RRB- .
21752593|There were no differences between groups in absolute amygdalae volume , although there was a relative increase in amygdalae volumes , when adjusted for total intracranial content .
21752593|There were no inter-hemispheric differences in amygdalae volumes in both groups .
21752593|These results suggest a relative increase in amygdala volume in WS compared with healthy controls that likely reflects abnormal neurodevelopmental processes of midline brain structures .
21757184|RESULTS : Cue-related activation was observed in the ventral striatum -LRB- across both subgroups -RRB- , amygdala -LRB- in the treatment-seeking subgroup and overall -RRB- , and orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- in the nontreatment-seeking subgroup and overall -RRB- but not insula cortex .
21757184|Finally , right amygdala and left middle frontal gyrus activity were positively associated with craving .
21757239|It is hypothesized that intentional perception of emotional faces activates connections between amygdala -LRB- Demir et al. -RRB- , orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- , anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- and prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- and that frontal-amygdala connections are altered in major depressive disorder -LRB- MDD -RRB- .
21757239|The interpretation of these findings could be that there is an emotional processing bias with disconnection bilaterally between amygdala to orbitofrontal cortices and in addition a right disconnection between amygdala and ACC as well as between ACC and prefrontal cortex possibly in line with a more prominent role for the right hemisphere in emotion processing .
21768930|Using positron emission tomography -LRB- PET -RRB- , D2R and DAT availability in the caudate nucleus -LRB- Cd -RRB- , putamen -LRB- Pt -RRB- , anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , and amygdala -LRB- AMY -RRB- were assessed before and after monkeys acquired cocaine self-administration .
21771661|Neuroimaging studies utilizing continuous flash suppression -LRB- CFS -RRB- have shown increased amygdala response to invisible fearful versus neutral faces .
21771661|The main brain regions of interest included the fusiform face area -LRB- FFA -RRB- , superior temporal sulcus -LRB- STS -RRB- , and amygdala .
21771661|Higher NA , but not trait fear , was associated with enhanced response to fearful versus neutral faces in STS and right amygdala -LRB- but not FFA -RRB- , within the invisible condition specifically .
21771661|The finding that NA rather than fearfulness predicted degree of amygdala reactivity to suppressed faces implicates the input subdivision of the amygdala in the observed effects .

21783174|Decreased fragile X mental retardation protein expression underlies amygdala dysfunction in carriers of the fragile X premutation .
21783174|METHODS : We completed functional magnetic resonance imaging targeting the amygdala with an emotion-matching task and concurrent infrared eye tracking , FMR1 molecular genetic testing , and neuropsychological assessment in 23 men with the premutation -LRB- mean age = 32.9 years -RRB- and 25 male control subjects -LRB- mean age = 30.1 years -RRB- .
21783174|RESULTS : Premutation carriers had significantly smaller left and right amygdala volume and reduced right amygdala activation during the task relative to control subjects .
21783174|Premutation carriers also had higher ratings of autism spectrum symptoms than control subjects , which were associated with the reduced amygdala response .
21783175|BACKGROUND : Posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- is associated with structural and functional compromise of the anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , which may in turn be associated with impairment of its ability to regulate the amygdala .
21784302|Abnormal amygdalar activation and connectivity in adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder .
21784302|Using dynamic causal modeling , we also examined the effective connectivity of two regions associated with emotional reactivity , i.e. , the amygdala and the lateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- LPFC -RRB- .
21784302|RESULTS : During the task , we found that activity in the right amygdala was greater in adolescents with ADHD than in control subjects .
21784302|In addition , in adolescents with ADHD , greater connectivity was detected between the amygdala and LPFC .
21784302|Stimulants had a normalizing effect on both the activity in the right amygdala and the connectivity between the amygdala and LPFC .
21784302|CONCLUSIONS : Our findings demonstrate that in adolescents with ADHD , a neural substrate of fear processing is atypical , as is the connectivity between the amygdala and LPFC .
21784971|We examined whole-brain functional connectivity of two brain structures previously implicated in emotional face processing in autism : the amygdala bilaterally and the right pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus -LRB- rIFGpo -RRB- .
21784971|In the ASD group , we observed reduced functional integration -LRB- i.e. , less long-range connectivity -RRB- between amygdala and secondary visual areas , as well as reduced segregation between amygdala and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex .

21799213|The experience of childhood trauma was a significant predictor of right and total amygdalar volumes and the hippocampal/amygdalar complex volume as a whole .
21799934|RESULTS : We found positive correlations between left uncinate fasciculus -LRB- UF -RRB- fractional anisotropy -LRB- FA -RRB- and resting state functional connectivity -LRB- rsFC -RRB- between the left ventrolateral PFC and left amygdala and between the left ventrolateral PFC and the left hippocampus .
21808873|There was a positive correlation between the right amygdala , bilateral fusiform gyri , right anterior insula , left inferior and middle temporal gyri , right superior temporal gyrus , and Disability Assessment for Dementia scores CONCLUSIONS : The results suggest that the neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in Alzheimer 's disease patients could be mainly due to frontal structural abnormalities , whereas disability could be associated with reductions in temporal structures .
21820247|During emotion identification , TD heightened activation in the orbital frontal cortex and bilateral amygdala , and this effect was attenuated by estradiol treatment .

21844357|sonia.lupien@umontreal.ca Maternal separation and poor maternal care in animals have been shown to have important effects on the developing hippocampus and amygdala .
21844357|However , children reared in orphanages present enlarged amygdala volumes , suggesting that the amygdala may be particularly sensitive to severely disturbed -LRB- i.e. , discontinous , neglectful -RRB- care in infancy .
21844357|To determine if poor maternal care associated with maternal depressive symptomatology has a similar pattern of association to the volumes of the hippocampus and amygdala in children , as is the case for severely disturbed infant care -LRB- orphanage rearing -RRB- , we measured hippocampal and amygdala volumes as well as stress hormone -LRB- glucocorticoid -RRB- levels in children exposed -LRB- n = 17 -RRB- or not -LRB- n = 21 -RRB- to maternal depressive symptomatology since birth .
21844357|Results revealed no group difference in hippocampal volumes , but larger left and right amygdala volumes and increased levels of glucocorticoids in the children of mothers presenting depressive symptomatology since birth .
21844357|Moreover , a significant positive correlation was observed between mothers ' mean depressive scores and amygdala volumes in their children .
21844357|The results of this study suggest that amygdala volume in human children may represent an early marker of biological sensitivity to quality of maternal care .
21846495|Our anterograde tracing data verified a strong bilateral input to the CPi , and the prepiriform cortex -LRB- CPP -RRB- , as well as small projections to the ipsilateral medial septum and the dorsolateral corticoid area and the nucleus taeniae of the amygdala in both hemispheres .
21849259|In electrical kindling , bipolar stimulating and monopolar recording electrodes were implanted stereotaxically in the right basolateral amygdala of male Sprague-Dawley rats .
21849980|In nonresponders relative to responders , gluMI was lower in left lateral orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- , and higher in left amygdala and uncinate fasciculus .
21849980|OFC and amygdala gluMI negatively correlated in nonresponders , positively correlated in responders , and did not correlate in healthy subjects .
21849980|Additionally , nonresponders had lower gluMI in left DLPFC , ACC , left and right insula , and higher gluMI in left amygdala and uncus .
21849980|Both preserved OFC volume and amygdala metabolism might precondition response to TMS .
21854858|Normal amygdala activation but deficient ventrolateral prefrontal activation in adults with bipolar disorder during euthymia .
21854858|Functional neuroimaging studies have implicated the involvement of the amygdala and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- vlPFC -RRB- in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder .
21854858|Hyperactivity in the amygdala and hypoactivity in the vlPFC have been reported in manic bipolar patients scanned during the performance of an affective faces task .
21854858|Neuroimaging results showed that , while amygdala activation did not differ significantly between groups , euthymic patients showed a significant decrease in activation of the right vlPFC -LRB- BA47 -RRB- compared to healthy controls during emotion labeling .
21854858|These data , taken in context with prior studies of bipolar mania using the same emotion recognition task , could suggest that amygdala dysfunction may be a state-related abnormality in bipolar disorder , whereas vlPFC dysfunction may represent a trait-related abnormality of the illness .
21861391|-LSB- Influence of anxiolytic afobazole on amygdalar neuronal activity and behavior of rabbits in emotionally negative situations -RSB- .
21861391|The influence of systemic injection of anxiolytic afobazole -LRB- 1 mg/kg -RRB- on interaction between neurons of the basal and central amygdaloor nuclei and behavior of rabbits in negative emotional situations was studied in order to reveal characteristics of amygdalar neuronal network properties during unconditioned fear .
21861391|Behavioral alterations were accompanied by duration increase and latency changes of amygdalar neuronal inhibitory interactions , by increase of probability of neuronal interactions on delta-range frequency , by decrease of interactions on theta-range frequency .
21861391|Under the influence of afobazole the asymmetry with right dominance in interhemispheric interaction of amygdalar neurons decreased .
21861391|Changes in network properties ofamygdalar neurons during afobazole injection testify to reduction of activation level of this structure taking place at the expense of enhancement of inhibitory interactions between neurons .
21867720|Measures of anxiety , amygdala volumes , and hippocampal scopolamine phMRI response in elderly female rhesus macaques .
21867720|MRI analyses showed that reserved monkeys had a smaller amygdala compared to bold monkeys but there were no group differences in hippocampal volumes .
21867720|In addition , the amount of time spent in the corners of the room was negatively correlated with the right amygdala as well as the total amygdala size .
21867720|Thus , in elderly female nonhuman primates measures of anxiety are associated with structural amygdala differences and hippocampal muscarinic receptor function .
21873832|Although numerous neuroimaging studies have examined depressed elders , there is limited research examining how amygdala volume may be related to depression .
21873832|DESIGN : A cross-sectional examination of amygdala volume comparing elders with and without a diagnosis of major depressive disorder , and between depressed subjects with early and later initial depression onset .
21873832|RESULTS : In models controlling for age , sex , and cerebral volume , there was a significant difference between diagnostic cohorts in amygdala volume bilaterally -LRB- left : F -LSB- 2 , 116 -RSB- = 16.28 , p < 0.0001 ; right : F -LSB- 2 , 116 -RSB- = 16.28 , p < 0.0001 -RRB- .
21873832|Using least squares mean group analyses , both early - and late-onset depressed subjects exhibited smaller bilateral amygdala volumes than did the nondepressed cohort -LRB- all comparisons p < 0.0001 -RRB- , but the two depressed cohorts did not exhibit a statistically significant difference .
21873832|LIMITATIONS : Limitations include missing antidepressant treatment data , recall bias , inability to establish a causal relationship between amygdala size and depression given the cross-sectional nature of the design .
21873832|CONCLUSIONS : Depression in later life is associated with smaller amygdala volumes , regardless of age of initial onset of depression .
21874014|A category-specific response to animals in the right human amygdala .
21874014|fmormann@yahoo.de The amygdala is important in emotion , but it remains unknown whether it is specialized for certain stimulus categories .
21874014|We analyzed responses recorded from 489 single neurons in the amygdalae of 41 neurosurgical patients and found a categorical selectivity for pictures of animals in the right amygdala .
21878701|Initially , the primary somatosensory cortex -LRB- SI -RRB- contralateral to the stimulation is activated , and the secondary somatosensory cortex -LRB- SII -RRB- , insula , amygdala , and anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- in both hemispheres are then activated sequentially .
21881566|Synchronous mothers showed greater activations in the left nucleus accumbens -LRB- NAcc -RRB- and intrusive mothers exhibited higher activations in the right amygdala .
21881566|Functional connectivity analysis revealed that among synchronous mothers , left NAcc and right amygdala were functionally correlated with emotion modulation , theory-of-mind , and empathy networks .
21881566|Among intrusive mothers , left NAcc and right amygdala were functionally correlated with pro-action areas .
21881566|Sorting points into neighborhood -LRB- SPIN -RRB- analysis demonstrated that in the synchronous group , left NAcc and right amygdala activations showed clearer organization across time , whereas among intrusive mothers , activations of these nuclei exhibited greater cross-time disorganization .
21881566|Correlations between Oxytocin with left NAcc and right amygdala activations were found only in the synchronous group .
21884712|Attentional capture by emotional stimuli is preserved in patients with amygdala lesions .
21884712|Previous research has documented enhanced processing of motivationally salient cues , and has pointed to the amygdala as a candidate neural structure underlying the enhancements .
21884712|In the current study , we examined whether the amygdala was necessary for this emotional modulation of attention to occur .
21884712|Patients with unilateral amygdala lesions and matched controls completed an emotional attentional blink task in which emotional distractors impair the perception of subsequent targets .
21884712|Emotional images proved more distracting across all participant groups , including those with right or left amygdala lesions .
21884712|These data argue against a central role for the amygdala in mediating all types of attentional capture by emotional stimuli .
21888185|The aim of this study is to compare the volumes of hippocampus , amygdala and subgenual prefrontal cortex among patients with melancholic depression , patients with psychotic depression and normal controls .
21888185|Hippocampal , amygdala , anterior and posterior subgenual cortex volumes were measured by manual tracings on magnetic resonance volumetric images and compared across the 3 groups .
21888185|We identified larger amygdala volumes and smaller left anterior subgenual cortex volumes in both patient groups compared to controls .
21888185|In conclusion , melancholic and psychotic depression were not differentiated regarding the volumes of the hippocampus , the amygdala , and anterior and posterior subgenual cortex , even though amygdala volumes and left anterior subgenual cortex volume of both patient groups were differentiated compared to controls .
21889995|In this study , MRI scans from ten pediatric subjects were employed for studying segmentations of amygdala , globus pallidus , putamen , caudate , and lateral ventricle .
21890110|After 8 weeks , the CRE-mediated activity decreased in the outer granule layer of dentate gyrus of neuropathic mice but not in the amygdala or in the anterior cingulate cortex .
21890211|The specific changes include lower gray matter volumes in the amygdala , the dorsal frontomedian cortex , and the right paracingulate cortex , as well as increases in glucose metabolism in the right subgenual and pregenual anterior cingulate cortices .
21890574|PD-MCI showed limited grey matter atrophy in the temporal , parietal and frontal cortex as well as the bilateral caudal hippocampus , amygdala and right putamen .
21893168|The present study aimed to investigate the effects of low frequency stimulation -LRB- LFS -RRB- targeting ANT on amygdala-kindled seizures in Sprague-Dawley rats .
21893168|Electrodes were implanted into the right basolateral amygdala and the right or bilateral ANT of Sprague-Dawley rats .
21893168|When fully kindled seizures were achieved by daily electrical stimulation of the amygdala , LFS -LRB- 15 min train of 0.1 ms pulses at 1 Hz and 200-500 ?A -RRB- was applied to the unilateral or bilateral ANT immediately before the kindling stimulation -LRB- pre-treatment -RRB- .
21893168|Our study demonstrated that bilateral LFS in ANT could significantly inhibit amygdala-kindled seizures by preventing both afterdischarge generation and propagation .
21893680|In addition , early occipital areas were found to have direct connections to the amygdala , which might underlie a rapid recruitment of limbic brain areas by visual inputs bypassing more elaborate extrastriate cortical processing .
21903664|AIMS : To examine the effects of cannabis on longitudinal thalamus and amygdala-hippocampal complex volumes within a population at high risk of schizophrenia .
21903664|Differential thalamic and amygdala-hippocampal complex volume change in high-risk individuals exposed -LRB- n = 25 -RRB- and not exposed -LRB- n = 32 -RRB- to cannabis in the intervening period was investigated using repeated-measures analysis of variance .
21911384|Activations specific for blind hemifield presentation of angry compared with neutral actions were found in the bilateral superior colliculus , pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus , amygdala , and right fusiform gyrus .
21920442|tmball@ucsd.edu Individuals with high anxiety show heightened neural activation in affective processing regions , including the amygdala and insula .
21920442|Using a robust multiple regression approach , we examined the effects of social anxiety , anxiety sensitivity , and trait anxiety -LRB- which overlapped with depressive symptoms , and can therefore be considered a measure of negative affectivity -RRB- on activation in insula , amygdala , and medial prefrontal cortex , in response to emotional faces .
21920442|Adjusting for negative affectivity and anxiety sensitivity , social anxiety was associated with activity in left amygdala , right insula , and subgenual anterior cingulate across all emotional faces .
21920442|When comparing negative and positive faces directly , greater negative affectivity was uniquely associated with less activity to positive faces in left amygdala , left anterior insula , and dorsal anterior cingulate .
21921542|At first , primary somatosensory cortex -LRB- SI -RRB- contralateral to the stimulation is activated and then secondary somatosensory cortex -LRB- SII -RRB- , insula , amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- in the bilateral hemispheres are activated sequentially .
21924872|Two recent meta-analyses have reported that gray matter volumes of schizophrenia and bipolar I patients differ in the amygdala , hippocampus , or perigenual anterior cingulate .
21924872|Region of interest analyses found moderately large to large differences between schizophrenia and healthy subjects in the amygdala and hippocampus .
21924872|When schizophrenia and bipolar groups were directly compared , the schizophrenia group showed smaller gray matter volumes in right subcortical regions involving the right hippocampus , putamen , and amygdala .
21924872|The hippocampal and amygdala findings confirm predictions derived from recent meta-analyses .
21925523|Lateralized amygdala activation : importance in the regulation of anxiety and pain behavior .
21925523|BACKGROUND : The amygdala is involved in the emotional responses to fear including anxiety and heightened pain reporting .
21925523|In a rodent model , bilateral activation of the central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- with corticosterone -LRB- CORT -RRB- produces anxiety-like behavior , somatic allodynia and visceral hypersensitivity .
21925523|Although hemisphere-specific processing differences between the left and right amygdala have been reported , it remains unclear whether the right or left CeA is involved in the production of anxiety-like behavior , and abnormal somatic and visceral perception .
21927556|Determination of the rCBF in the amygdala and rhinal cortex using a FAIR-TrueFISP sequence .
21927556|The investigation of the rhinal cortex and the amygdala is a potentially important feature for the diagnosis and research on dementia in its early stages .
21927556|FAIR-True-FISP quantitative perfusion data were evaluated in the amygdala on both sides and in the pons .
21927556|RESULTS : Perfusion values in the right amygdala , left amygdala and pons were 65.2 -LRB-  18.2 -RRB- mL/100 g/minute , 64.6 -LRB-  21.0 -RRB- mL/100 g/minute , and 74.4 -LRB-  19.3 -RRB- mL/100 g/minute , respectively .
21927556|CONCLUSION : The FAIR-TrueFISP approach is feasible for the quantitative assessment of perfusion in the amygdala .
21931738|Self-regulation of amygdala activation using real-time FMRI neurofeedback .
21931738|We investigated the feasibility of training healthy humans to self-regulate the hemodynamic activity of the amygdala , which plays major roles in emotional processing .
21931738|Participants in the experimental group were provided with ongoing information about the blood oxygen level dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- activity in the left amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- and were instructed to raise the BOLD rtfMRI signal by contemplating positive autobiographical memories .
21931738|Functional connectivity analysis of the amygdala network revealed significant widespread correlations in a fronto-temporo-limbic network .
21931738|The findings demonstrate that healthy subjects can learn to regulate their amygdala activation using rtfMRI neurofeedback , suggesting possible applications of rtfMRI neurofeedback training in the treatment of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders .
21932257|Putative neuronal sources contributing to the modulation of this component were localized in a network of brain regions including bilateral supplementary motor areas , middle and posterior cingulate cortex , precuneus , associative visual areas , as well as in the right amygdala and insula .
21934726|RESULTS : Naming famous faces caused more activation in the bilateral head of the hippocampus and amygdala with significant left dominance .
21935985|We have recently shown that CD with positive abnormal or excessive motor symptoms was associated with greater amygdala activity to arousing stimuli along with greater functional connectivity between the amygdala and supplementary motor area .
21935985|During both internally and externally generated movement , conversion disorder patients relative to normal volunteers had lower left supplementary motor area -LRB- SMA -RRB- -LRB- implicated in motor initiation -RRB- and higher right amygdala , left anterior insula , and bilateral posterior cingulate activity -LRB- implicated in assigning emotional salience -RRB- .
21942764|In addition , lOFC showed changes in functional connectivity strength with amygdala and insula as a function of decision bias , and individual differences in the strengths of connectivities between lOFC and bilateral insula were also found to predict the likelihood of responders to reject offers from untrustworthy-looking proposers .
21945867|At baseline , restrained eaters had greater activation in the left amygdala and the right thalamus in response to fattening food cues than did their unrestrained co-twins .
21945867|As compared to their unrestrained co-twins , restrained eaters who drank a milkshake had greater decreases in activation by fattening food images in the left amygdala and occipital lobe , and greater increases in activation by non-fattening food images in the medial orbitofrontal cortex .

21948742|Anatomy and aging of the amygdala and hippocampus in autism spectrum disorder : an in vivo magnetic resonance imaging study of Asperger syndrome .
21948742|clodagh.m.murphy@kcl.ac.uk It has been proposed that people with autism spectrum disorder -LRB- ASD -RRB- have abnormal morphometry and development of the amygdala and hippocampus -LRB- AH -RRB- .
21948742|However , individuals with Asperger syndrome had a significantly larger raw bulk volume of total -LRB- P < 0.01 -RRB- , right -LRB- P < 0.01 -RRB- , and left amygdala -LRB- P < 0.05 -RRB- ; and when corrected for overall brain size , total -LRB- P < 0.05 -RRB- , and right amygdala -LRB- P < 0.01 -RRB- .
21948742|There was a significant group difference in aging of left amygdala ; controls , but not individuals with Asperger syndrome , had a significant age-related increase in volume -LRB- r = 0.486 , P < 0.01 , and r = 0.007 , P = 0.97 , z = 1.995 -RRB- .
21948742|Individuals with Asperger syndrome have significant differences from controls in bulk volume and aging of the amygdala .
21959363|D + patients had significantly lower perfusion in the right orbitofrontal and inferior frontal gyri than D - patients , whereas A + patients had this in the right amygdala , temporal , posterior cingulate , right superior frontal , postcentral , and left superior temporal gyri than A - patients .
21961776|Progression of amygdala volumetric abnormalities in adolescents after their first manic episode .
21961776|OBJECTIVE : Although previous neuroimaging studies suggest that adolescents with bipolar disorder exhibit smaller amygdala volumes compared with healthy adolescents , whether these abnormalities are present at illness onset or instead develop over time remains unclear .
21961776|The aim of this study was to conduct a prospective longitudinal investigation comparing amygdala neurodevelopment among adolescents after their first manic episode , adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder -LRB- ADHD -RRB- , and healthy adolescents .
21961776|RESULTS : Mixed models examining the group  time effect for both left -LRB- p = .005 -RRB- and right -LRB- p = .002 -RRB- amygdala volumes were statistically significant .
21961776|Change in left -LRB- p = .01 -RRB- and right -LRB- p = .0008 -RRB- amygdala volumes from baseline to 12 months were significantly different among groups .
21961776|Specifically , left amygdala volumes increased over time in healthy adolescents -LRB- p = .008 -RRB- and adolescents with ADHD -LRB- p = .0009 -RRB- , but not in adolescents with bipolar disorder -LRB- p = .3 -RRB- .
21961776|Right amygdala volume increased over time in adolescents with ADHD -LRB- p < .001 -RRB- , but not in healthy adolescents nor in adolescents with bipolar disorder -LRB- p = .1 and p = .3 , respectively -RRB- .
21961776|In adolescents with bipolar disorder , baseline total amygdala volume was significantly greater in those who subsequently achieved symptomatic recovery as compared with those who did not achieve recovery -LRB- p = .02 -RRB- .
21961776|CONCLUSIONS : Adolescents with mania do not exhibit normal increases in amygdala volume that occur during healthy adolescent neurodevelopment .
21967725|Is there a correlation between hippocampus and amygdala volume and olfactory function in healthy subjects ?
21967725|Both amygdala -LRB- AG -RRB- and hippocampus -LRB- HC -RRB- are integral parts of the olfactory system .
21972426|When primed with Taste , rostral anterior cingulate tracked value in terms of taste whereas left amygdala and left putamen were associated with choice .
21979818|Mean diffusivity in the amygdala correlates with anxiety in pediatric TBI .
21979818|In the present study , we integrated anatomical and diffusion tensor neuroimaging to investigate structural properties of the amygdala and hippocampus , gray matter regions implicated in anxiety and mood disorders .
21979818|Mean diffusivity -LRB- MD -RRB- of the amygdala and hippocampus was elevated following TBI .
21979818|An interaction of hemisphere , structure , and group revealed that MD of the right amygdala was elevated in females with TBI .
21979818|Self-reported anxiety scores were not related to either volume or microstructure of the hippocampus , or to volume or fractional anisotropy of the amygdala .
21979818|Left amygdala MD in the TBI group accounted for 17.5 % of variance in anxiety scores .
21984582|In type 1 diabetic subjects , higher HbA -LRB- 1c -RRB- was associated with lower activation in the right parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala -LRB- R -LRB- 2 -RRB- = 0.45 , P < 0.002 -RRB- .
21995346|Smaller right amygdala in Caucasian alcohol-dependent male patients with a history of intimate partner violence : a volumetric imaging study .
21995346|Results revealed that IPV-ADs , compared with non-violent ADs and HCs , had a significant volume reduction in the right amygdala .
21995346|This finding suggests that structural deficits in the right amygdala may underlie impulsive types of aggression often seen in alcohol-dependent patients with a history of IPV .
22009130|Lateralization of amygdala activation in fMRI may depend on phase-encoding polarity .
22009130|kamathiak@ukaachen.de OBJECT : Susceptibility artifacts along the phase-encoding -LRB- PE -RRB- direction impact the activation pattern in the amygdala and may lead to systematic asymmetries .
22009130|We implemented a triple-echo echo-planar imaging -LRB- EPI -RRB- sequence , acquiring opposite PE polarities along left-right PE direction in a single shot , to investigate its effects on amygdala lateralization .
22009130|MATERIALS AND METHODS : Twelve subjects viewed emotional faces to evoke amygdala activation .
22009130|RESULTS AND CONCLUSION : A region of interest analysis revealed that the lateralization of amygdala responses depended on the PE polarity thus representing a pure method artifact .
22012980|However , the brain regions we identified were specifically associated with online social network size , whereas the grey matter density of the amygdala was correlated both with online and real-world social network sizes .
22024246|The walking figure condition was associated with increased activity in a constellation of social information processing and biological motion areas , including STS , MT + / V5 , right pars opercularis -LRB- inferior frontal gyrus -RRB- , fusiform gyrus , and amygdala .
22024246|Correctly answered walking figure trials were uniquely associated with increased activity in two right hemisphere STS clusters and right amygdala .
22024858|The comparison of patients and controls showed ENS-specific activation of temporal and cerebellar areas and amygdala during the rating task itself .
22037127|We hypothesized rCBF changes along the afferent pathway of the vagus and in regions associated with depression -LRB- eg , orbitofrontal cortex , amygdala , insular cortex -RRB- .
22044532|Apathy was related to the ventral tegmental area , a component of the motivational dopaminergic network ; disinhibition to both anterior temporal lobes including the anterior hippocampi and left amygdala , caudate head , orbitofrontal cortex and insulae ; and eating disorders to the right lateral -LRB- orbito -RRB- frontal cortex/insula .
22054872|The hippocampus , amygdala , and parahippocampal , perirhinal , entorhinal , and temporopolar cortices of right and left hemisphere were defined as ROIs .
22054872|An age-related attenuation was also present during encoding , but only in right parahippocampus and amygdala .
22060063|The gray matter atrophy pattern corresponded to this focal deficit profile , with preservation of dorsolateral fronto-parietal regions associated with executive functioning but severe damage to right worse than left frontoinsula , temporal pole , subgenual anterior cingulate , medial orbitofrontal cortex , amygdala , and caudate .
22071630|In addition , in line with the SA 's role in fear attenuation -LRB- presumably to facilitate caregiving during stress -RRB- , increased SA activity during support giving was associated with reduced left -LRB- r = -0.44 , p < .05 -RRB- and right -LRB- r = -0.42 , p < .05 -RRB- amygdala activity .
22076860|Because models of pathological anxiety posit altered frontolimbic interactions , the uncinate fasciculus -LRB- UF -RRB- connecting -LRB- orbito - -RRB- frontal and temporal areas including the amygdala is of particular interest .
22076860|Reduced volume of the left UF in SAD fits well into pathophysiological models of anxiety , as it suggests deficient structural connectivity between higher-level control areas in the orbitofrontal cortex and more basal limbic areas like the amygdala .
22087612|RESULTS : The BOLD signal intensities increased in Periods 2 and 3 , and then started to decrease in Period 4 in the right amygdala , supramarginal gyrus , temporal pole , and superior temporal gyrus .
22087612|Especially , BOLD signal intensity was elevated promptly in the insula and the parahippocampal gyrus , whereas it was persistently elevated -LRB- delayed effect -RRB- in the amygdala .
22101997|The objective of this study was to use high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- techniques to investigate the volumes of the hippocampus , amygdala , and temporal and frontal lobes in children with DS compared with healthy children .
22101997|Volumes of the right and left hippocampus , the right and left amygdala , temporal and frontal lobes and the total brain volume were measured by a radiologist who was unaware of the diagnosis .
22101997|Children with DS had a significantly smaller right and left hippocampus volume and a significantly smaller right and left amygdala volume than did the control group .
22102296|When ?4 noncarriers correctly identified a target , there were greater associations between the amygdala , MTL , and right frontal lobe ; these associations also modeled the brain 's response when ?4 noncarriers misidentified a foil as a target .
22113213|nosaka@bun.kyoto-u.ac.jp Although the role of the amygdala in processing facial expressions of fear is well established , its role in the processing of other emotions , such as sadness , remains unclear .
22113213|We hypothesized that the amygdala would respond to a negative emotion such as sadness , when sadness was represented by a theatrical mask .
22113213|Results based on a region of interest analysis indicated the activation of the right amygdala while viewing sad masks .
22113213|We suggest the fact that such delicate sad masks could activate the amygdala , and it could possibly be because of an underlying similarity to emotions such as fear and disgust .
22118249|These changes and alterations in limbic regions like ACC and amygdala are more pronounced in non-treated populations and seem to diminish over time from child to adulthood .
22119640|This bias is associated with abnormal activities in emotion-processing regions -LRB- such as the amygdala -RRB- and cognitive-control regions -LRB- such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LSB- DLPFC -RSB- -RRB- .
22119640|Compared with control participants , depressed patients showed abnormal activity in bilateral amygdala and the right DLPFC .
22119640|In addition , a significant correlation was found between the right amygdala and the right DLPFC when subjects observed the happy faces .
22125232|Connectivity analyses with an mPFC/dACC seed revealed coactivation with the left insula and amygdala during arm touch .
22131304|The second analysis contrasted noxious cold with noxious heat stimulation and revealed higher likelihood of activation to noxious cold in the subgenual ACC and the amygdala .
22131397|Using functional magnetic resonance imaging , we show that psychopathy is associated with reduced functional connectivity between vmPFC and amygdala as well as between vmPFC and medial parietal cortex .
22131970|Bilateral mid-fusiform areas and a different right mid-fusiform area were sensitive to physical change within the human and avatar categories , respectively , whereas entirely different regions were sensitive to the human-to-avatar -LRB- caudate head , putamen , thalamus , red nucleus -RRB- and avatar-to-human -LRB- hippocampus , amygdala , mid-insula -RRB- direction of category change .
22134041|The present structural MRI study aimed to determine the relationship between amygdala , cingulate and subgenual prefrontal cortex volumes in MDD and their associations with child abuse and antidepressants .
22134041|Volumes of subgenual prefrontal cortex , amygdala and affective , cognitive , superior and posterior divisions of cingulate cortex were analyzed using DISPLAY software using reliable volumetric protocols .
22134041|RESULTS : MDD subjects had low cingulate -LRB- cognitive division -RRB- and high amygdala volumes .
22134041|SUMMARY : Our data suggest that MDD may be associated with alterations in anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala .
22136615|LH-RH agonists modulate amygdala response to visual sexual stimulation : a single case fMRI study in pedophilia .
22136615|The pre-treatment contrasts of the erotic pictures against the respective neutral pictures showed an activation of the right amygdala and adjacent parahippocampal gyrus that decreased significantly under treatment with leuprolide acetate .
22136615|Our single case fMRI study supports the notion that anti-androgens may modify amygdala response to visual erotic stimulation , a hypothesis that should be further examined in larger studies .
22144968|Additionally , contrasts between sad music with versus without lyrics recruited the parahippocampal gyrus , the amygdala , the claustrum , the putamen , the precentral gyrus , the medial and inferior frontal gyri -LRB- including Broca 's area -RRB- , and the auditory cortex , while the reverse contrast produced no activations .
22173010|In males , Left PP -LRB- relative to Right PP -RRB- was associated with reduced striatal dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- levels and amygdala DA metabolism bilaterally .
22173010|In females , Left PP was associated with a bilateral upregulation of DAergic metabolism in both prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens , increased amygdala serotonin metabolism , and a -LRB- right -RRB- unilateral increase in amygdala DA .
22174802|Extraversion is linked to volume of the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala .
22174802|Orbitofrontal and right amygdala volume were both positively related to extraversion .
22174802|As extraversion is regarded a protective factor for developing anxiety disorders and depression and has been related to the generation of positive affect , the present results indicate that the reduced likelihood of developing affective disorders in individuals high on extraversion is related to modulation of emotion processing through the orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala .
22174900|Convergent evidence from multimodal imaging reveals amygdala abnormalities in schizophrenic patients and their first-degree relatives .
22174900|RESULTS : Schizophrenic patients showed widespread gray matter reductions in the bilateral frontal cortices , bilateral insulae , bilateral occipital cortices , left amygdala and right thalamus , whereas their parents showed more localized reductions in the left amygdala , left thalamus and right orbitofrontal cortex .
22174900|Patients and their parents shared gray matter loss in the left amygdala .
22174900|Further investigation of the resting-state functional connectivity of the amygdala in the patients showed abnormal functional connectivity with the bilateral orbitofrontal cortices , bilateral precunei , bilateral dorsolateral frontal cortices and right insula .
22174900|Their parents showed slightly less , but similar changes in the pattern in the amygdala connectivity .
22174900|Co-occurrences of abnormal connectivity of the left amygdala with the left orbitofrontal cortex , right dorsolateral frontal cortex and right precuneus were observed in schizophrenic patients and their parents .
22174900|CONCLUSIONS : Our findings suggest a potential genetic influence on structural and functional abnormalities of the amygdala in schizophrenia .
22177038|In task 1 , the brain activation in bilateral cerebellum , frontal -LRB- including orbitofrontal gyrus -RRB- , insula , thalamus , cingulate gyrus , putamen , amygdala , piriform cortex , the left inferior parietal lobule , precentral gyrus , right hippocampus , pallidum , middle temporal gyrus , supramarginal gyrus .
22182770|In a previous fMRI study we assessed the neural correlates of audio-visual integration and found that activity in the left amygdala is significantly attenuated when a neutral stimulus is paired with an emotional one compared to conditions where emotional stimuli were present in both channels .
22182770|All winning models share a connection from the bilateral fusiform gyrus -LRB- FFG -RRB- into the left amygdala and a non-linear modulatory influence of bilateral posterior superior temporal sulcus -LRB- pSTS -RRB- on these connections .
22182770|This result indicates that the pSTS not only integrates multi-modal information from visual and auditory regions -LRB- as reflected in our model by significant feed-forward connections -RRB- but also gates the influence of the sensory information on the left amygdala , leading to attenuation of amygdala activity when a neutral stimulus is integrated .
22187105|The ASD group demonstrated hyperactivation in bilateral amygdala during face anticipation that predicted social symptom severity and in bilateral insular cortex during face outcomes .
22187105|Additionally , atypical amygdala activation during the processing of social rewards may contribute to the development or expression of autistic features .
22192882|CONCLUSIONS : White matter atrophy was clearly identified in AD , mainly in bilateral structures close to memory formations such as the hippocampus , amygdala , and entorhinal cortex .
22197572|All these studies suggest that unconscious processing of emotional information is mainly subsumed by a right hemisphere subcortical route , through which emotional stimuli quickly reach the amygdala .
22206802|The right cerebral hemisphere was 1.9 % larger than the left hemisphere ; the right amygdala and right caudate nuclei were 24 % and 9.9 % larger , respectively , compared with the left side .
22206802|Fractional anisotropy was increased on the right side as compared with the left for 4 of the 5 bilateral regions studied -LRB- the amygdala , caudate , frontal lobe , and hippocampus -RRB- .
22206802|Fiber tract bundle volumes were larger on the right side for the amygdala , hippocampus , frontal lobe , and occipital lobe .
22206802|The corpus callosum and left amygdala also exhibited high axial , radial , and mean diffusivities .
22206877|During negative encoding , increased insular activation was observed in both depressed groups -LRB- MDD and MDD + anxiety -RRB- , whereas increased amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex activation during positive word encoding were observed as depressive state-dependent effects in MDD only .
22206877|Increased insular and amygdalar involvement during negative word encoding may underlie heightened experience of , and an inability to disengage from , negative emotions in depressive disorders .
22209122|Comparisons between pre - and post-ECT metabolic activity revealed decreased regional metabolism in the frontotemporal neocortical areas after ECT , while increased metabolism was found in the right medial temporal structures including amygdala and pons .
22210355|Group differences in the object processing system indicated that responses in the face-selective right lateral fusiform gyrus and anterior superior temporal cortex were sensitive to a combination of altered sensory and language experience , whereas responses in the amygdala were more closely tied to sensory experience .
22210673|In contrast , impulsive-antisociality evidenced increased behavioral interference to both positive and negative words and correlated positively with recruitment of regions associated with motivational salience -LRB- amygdala , orbitofrontal cortex , insula -RRB- , emotion regulation -LRB- temporal cortex , superior frontal gyrus -RRB- and attentional control -LRB- dorsal anterior cingulate cortex -RRB- .
22217336|They also exhibited persistent increases in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left amygdala activity for the same stimuli during reappraisal , as well as additional activation in supplementary motor area and ventral caudate during the suppression of social positive emotions .
22217336|In contrast , anxiously attached participants showed differential increases in the right amygdala and left parahippocampal cortex for social negative and positive stimuli , respectively , but only when making spontaneous emotion judgments .
22220463|cingulate , prefrontal , orbitofrontal , and insular cortex , nucleus accumlens , amygdala , periaqueduktalne gray matter and spinal cord .
22238103|Right temporoparietal junction/posterior superior temporal sulcus -LRB- RTPJ/pSTS -RRB- , planum temporale/parietal operculum -LRB- PT/PO -RRB- , and posterior lateral orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- plOFC -RRB- had local gray matter volume that was both sexually dimorphic and predicted in a congruent direction by FT. That is , gray matter volume in RTPJ/pSTS was greater for males compared to females and was positively predicted by FT. Conversely , gray matter volume in PT/PO and plOFC was greater in females compared to males and was negatively predicted by FT. Subregions of both amygdala and hypothalamus were also sexually dimorphic in the direction of Male > Female , but were not predicted by FT. However , FT positively predicted gray matter volume of a non-sexually dimorphic subregion of the amygdala .
22264344|Substance use disorders are associated with greater cue-reactivity in orbitofrontal cortex , anterior cingulate cortex , striatum , ventral tegmental area and amygdala .
22267184|Increased medial orbitofrontal and amygdala activation : evidence for a systems-level endophenotype of bipolar I disorder .
22267184|Data were analyzed using a region-of-interest approach restricting analysis to the medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex , the amygdala , the anterior cingulate cortex , and the striatum .
22267184|Activation of the amygdala in response to reward reversal was increased in patients and relatives .
22267184|In response to reward , activation of the amygdala was greater only in relatives , but there was a significant negative correlation between medication and amygdala activation in patients .
22267184|CONCLUSIONS : These results identify increased activity of the orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala , related to heightened sensitivity to reward and deficient prediction error signal , as a candidate endophenotype of bipolar disorder .
22275167|Shared representations were revealed for happy facial expressions in the pars opercularis , the precentral gyrus , in the superior temporal gyrus/medial temporal gyrus -LRB- MTG -RRB- , in the pre-supplementary motor area and in the right amygdala .
22279203|Statistical analyses of source estimations identified looming-specific interactions within the right claustrum/insula extending inferiorly into the amygdala and also within the bilateral cuneus extending into the inferior and lateral occipital cortices .
22283490|Direct comparison between patients and controls showed that increased functional connectivity caused by tinnitus occurred predominantly in the left amygdala and in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex .
22297661|After digitally subtracting the control group , these areas included the bilateral amygdala , left orbital gyrus , bilateral fusiform gyrus , and left visual cortex .
22305953|A shape complex is a collection of neighboring shapes - for example , the thalamus , amygdala and the hippocampus circuit - which may exhibit changes in shape across multiple structures during the progression of a disease .
22322075|CDT performance was related to volume and shape measurements of amygdala , caudate nucleus , hippocampus , nucleus accumbens , pallidum , putamen , and thalamus , respectively .
22330316|Results showed robust evoked activation of all three tasks in their respective target regions -LRB- emotional task = amygdala ; motivational task = ventral striatum ; cognitive task = right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and parietal cortices -RRB- with high effect sizes -LRB- ES -RRB- of ROI-mean summary values -LRB- ES = 1.11-1 .44 for the faces task , 0.96-1 .43 for the reward task , 0.83-2 .58 for the n-back task -RRB- .
22330606|A conjunction contrast at the group level -LCB- -LRB- F-SF -RRB- and -LRB- F-O -RRB- -RCB- identified six clusters : in the pulvinar , inferior occipital gyrus -LRB- so-called OFA -RRB- , middle fusiform gyrus -LRB- so-called FFA -RRB- , posterior superior temporal sulcus , amygdala , and anterior infero-temporal cortex , which were all strongly right lateralized .
22342105|In addition , regression analyses indicated a highly significant negative correlation between gambling severity scores and right amygdala activation associated with gain-related expected value coding .
22342105|Furthermore , the negative relation between gambling severity and amygdala activation in gain expected value coding suggests that more severe PRGs are less likely to be risk aversive during gambling .
22367971|FMRI data analysis revealed that PTSD subjects showed a significantly higher activation in right insula and left amygdala that we did not observe in healthy subjects ; on the contrary , healthy controls showed a greater activation of left lingual gyrus .
22371351|At rest , AP induced increased activation in the insula and in the amygdala , which have been previously associated with the autonomic control and emotion processing , as well as in the caudate nucleus and in the medial temporal cortex , both implicated in cognitive functions .
22373717|In a patient with negative MRI findings , intracranial EEG recordings documented a strict correlation between habitual ictal anxiety attacks and both spontaneous and stimulation-induced epileptic activity in a right occipital epileptogenic area with subsequent spreading to the symptomatogenic zone in the amygdala .
22378896|Conversely , among A-carriers , BOLD signal was smaller in MDD -LRB- n = 7 -RRB- compared with controls -LRB- n = 50 -RRB- in the hypothalamus , bilateral amygdala , and left nucleus accumbens .
22381514|The personality trait self-directedness predicts the amygdala 's reaction to appetizing cues in fMRI .
22381514|Food compared to control stimuli elicited a significantly higher appetite rating , as well as strong activation in the ventral and dorsal visual stream , the fusiform gyrus and consecutive limbic centres such as the parahippocampal gyrus , the amygdala , the thalamus , the insula , the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex .
22381514|In a region-of-interest analysis , the TCI trait self-directedness was negatively correlated with mean blood oxygenation level dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- signal change in the right amygdala -LRB- r = -.43 , p = .025 -RRB- .
22381514|Ultimately , amygdala reactivity might provide a risk factor for the development of eating disorders .
22391134|RESULTS : Cocaine-dependent individuals had lower GM volumes in a number of sections of the orbitofrontal cortex , right inferior frontal gyrus , right insula , left amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus , temporal gyrus , and bilateral caudate .
22398297|Elevated amygdala activity to negative faces in young adults with early onset major depressive disorder .
22398297|Abnormalities in amygdala activity have been implicated in adolescents and older adults with major depressive disorder -LRB- MDD -RRB- , but few studies have focused on young adults with early-onset MDD .
22398297|In this study , we measured amygdala activity in 27 young adults with early-onset MDD and 25 healthy controls -LRB- HC -RRB- using functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- with an emotional processing task .
22398297|Both groups showed significant bilateral activation within the amygdala to threat-related facial expressions .
22398297|In the matching face task , the activations of the left amygdala , thalamus , prefrontal and temporal cortex were significantly greater while the activation of the right prefrontal was significantly lower for the MDD group compared with the HC group .
22398297|For the MDD group , there was a significant positive correlation between the activity of the amygdala and scores on the Chinese version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale .
22399092|Mixed handedness is associated with greater age-related decline in volumes of the hippocampus and amygdala : the PATH through life study .
22399092|The association between handedness and hippocampal and amygdalar atrophy was investigated in 327 cognitively healthy older individuals .
22399092|Hippocampal and amygdalar volumes were manually traced on scans acquired 4 years apart .
22399092|Regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between strength and direction of handedness and incident hippocampal and amygdalar atrophy .
22399092|Analyses showed that strength but not direction of handedness was a significant predictor of hippocampal -LRB- Left : beta = 0.118 , P = 0.013 ; Right : beta = 0.116 , P = 0.010 -RRB- and amygdalar -LRB- Right : beta = 0.105 , P = 0.040 -RRB- atrophy .
22399092|The present findings suggest that mixed but not left handedness is associated with greater hippocampal and amygdalar atrophy .
22401827|BACKGROUND : Ineffective emotion regulation and abnormal amygdala activation have each been found in adolescent-onset major depressive disorder .
22401827|However , amygdala activation during emotion regulation has not been studied in adolescent-onset major depressive disorder .
22401827|RESULTS : Imaging analyses demonstrated that adolescents with depression showed : -LRB- 1 -RRB- greater right amygdala activation during the maintain condition relative to controls , -LRB- 2 -RRB- less connectivity during the maintain condition between the amygdala and both the insula and medial prefrontal cortex than controls , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- a significant positive correlation between amygdala-seeded connectivities during maintenance of emotion and psychosocial functioning .
22401827|LIMITATIONS : The current study is a cross-sectional comparison and longitudinal investigations with larger sample sizes are needed to examine the association between amygdala reactivity and emotion regulation over time in adolescent MDD .
22401827|CONCLUSIONS : During the maintain condition , adolescents with depression showed a heightened amygdala response and less reciprocal activation in brain regions that may modulate the amygdala .
22401827|A poorly modulated , overreactive amygdala may contribute to poor emotion regulation .
22403745|A region-of-interest analysis showed that a significantly increased rCBF of the anterior cingulate cortex and right amygdala was associated with arterial cannulation in MDD .
22403745|A whole brain analysis showed increased rCBF of the right post-central gyrus , left temporopolar cortex , and right amygdala during arterial cannulation in MDD patients .
22403745|The rCBF in the right amygdala was significantly correlated with depression severity .
22406509|In healthy people , extraversion is associated with hemodynamic responses in the amygdala and electrophysiological brain activity such as event-related potential and event-related desynchronization during emotional face processing .
22406694|We discuss results from neuropsychology and neuroimaging research suggesting that specific mechanisms for emotional attention might exist , centered on the amygdala and other limbic regions , and that these mechanisms can operate partly independent from other circuits controlling spatial and object-based attention .
22411788|Based on the documented role of the insula in mediating emotional response tendencies and personality , we used multimodal imaging to characterize this region in WS and found convergent anomalies : an overall decrease in dorsal anterior insula -LRB- AI -RRB- gray-matter volume along with locally increased volume in the right ventral AI ; compromised white-matter integrity of the uncinate fasciculus connecting the insula with the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex ; altered regional cerebral blood flow in a pattern reminiscent of the observed gray-matter alterations -LRB- i.e. , widespread reductions in dorsal AI accompanied by locally increased regional cerebral blood flow in the right ventral AI -RRB- ; and disturbed neurofunctional interactions between the AI and limbic regions .
22414635|-LRB- 18 -RRB- F-FDG PET was used to measure differences in the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose in the following regions of interest : insula , cingulate , and amygdala .
22418015|Interaction of the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region and environmental adversity : increased amygdala-hypothalamus connectivity as a potential mechanism linking neural and endocrine hyperreactivity .
22418015|METHODS : In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study , amygdala reactivity to fearful stimuli was assessed in healthy male adults -LRB- n = 44 -RRB- , who were previously found to differ with regard to endocrine stress reactivity as a function of 5-HTTLPR  SLEs .
22418015|Furthermore , functional connectivity between the amygdala and the hypothalamus was measured as a potential mechanism linking elevated neural and endocrine responses during stressful/threatening situations .
22418015|RESULTS : We report significant G  E interaction on neural response patterns and functional amygdala-hypothalamus connectivity .
22418015|Specifically , homozygous carriers of the 5-HTTLPR S ' allele with a history of SLEs -LRB- S 'S ' / high SLEs group -RRB- displayed elevated bilateral amygdala activation in response to fearful faces .
22418015|Furthermore , S 'S ' / high SLEs subjects were characterized by an increased functional coupling between the right amygdala and the hypothalamus , thus indicating a potential link between neural and endocrine hyperreactivity .
22420592|x. Amygdala activity and prefrontal cortex-amygdala effective connectivity to emerging emotional faces distinguish remitted and depressed mood states in bipolar disorder .
22420592|We used Granger Causality Mapping -LRB- GCM -RRB- to map EC between the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- and bilateral amygdala and a novel paradigm to assess emotion processing in adults with BD .
22420592|GCM measured EC preceding -LRB- top-down -RRB- and following -LRB- bottom-up -RRB- activity between the PFC and the left and right amygdalae .
22420592|RESULTS : Our findings indicated patterns of abnormally elevated bilateral amygdala activity in response to emerging fearful , sad , and angry facial expressions in remitted-BD subjects versus HC , and abnormally elevated right amygdala activity to emerging fearful faces in depressed-BD subjects versus HC .
22420592|We also showed distinguishable patterns of abnormal EC between the amygdala and dorsomedial and ventrolateral PFC , especially to emerging happy and sad facial expressions in remitted-BD and depressed-BD subjects .
22420592|Our findings suggest major differences in recruitment of amygdala-PFC circuitry , supporting implicit emotion processing between remitted-BD and depressed-BD subjects , which may underlie changes from remission to depression in BD .
22420593|A longitudinal functional connectivity analysis of the amygdala in bipolar I disorder across mood states .
22420593|The amygdala seems to play a central role in this network and is responsible for appraisal of emotional stimuli .
22420593|To further understand the role of the amygdala in the generation of mood symptoms , we used functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- to examine a group of patients with bipolar I disorder longitudinally .
22420593|Whole-brain functional connectivity analysis was performed using the left and right amygdala as seed regions .
22420593|RESULTS : Significant changes in amygdala functional connectivity were found between the manic and depressed phases of illness .
22420593|The right amygdala was significantly more positively correlated with the left inferior frontal gyrus during mania and with the right insula during depression .
22420593|There were no significant differences in left amygdala correlations across mood states in the bipolar I disorder group .
22420593|CONCLUSIONS : In the transition from a manic/mixed episode to a depressive episode , subjects with bipolar I disorder showed unique changes in cortical-amygdala functional connectivity .
22420593|Increased connectivity between the insula and right amygdala may generate excessive positive feedback , in that both of these regions are involved in the appraisal of emotional stimuli .
22420593|Increased correlation between the right amygdala and the inferior frontal gyrus in mania is consistent with previous findings of decreased prefrontal modulation of limbic regions in mania .
22423570|The epileptogenic zone was localized to the right temporal lobe , and an extensive surgical removal of the temporal neocortex plus amygdala and hippocampus was performed .
22423570|In the amygdala , GABA was found whereas other amino acids were absent .
22429025|Sequential changes in glucose metabolism on -LRB- 18 -RRB- F-FDG PET using SPM2 and the ratios of percent injected dose per gram -LRB- % ID -RRB- / g of regions of interest -LRB- ROIs -RRB- in the bilateral amygdala , hippocampus , basal ganglia with the thalamus , cortex , and hypothalamus normalized to the pons were determined .
22430303|Stress , food and body mass index -LRB- BMI -RRB- have been separately shown to affect amygdala activity .
22430303|However , it is not known whether stress influences amygdala responses to palatable foods , and whether this response is associated with chronic stress or BMI .
22430303|In contrast , whereas the left amygdala responds to milkshake irrespective of condition , the right amygdala responds to milkshake only under stressful conditions .
22430303|Moreover , this right amygdala response is positively associated with basal cortisol levels , an objective measure of chronic stress .
22430303|CONCLUSION : These results demonstrate that acute stress potentiates response to food in the right amygdala and OFC as a function of chronic stress and body weight , respectively .
22430303|This suggests that the influence of acute stress in potentiating amygdala and OFC responses to food is dependent upon individual factors like BMI and chronic stress .
22432905|Functional cliques in the amygdala and related brain networks driven by fear assessment acquired during movie viewing .
22432905|Brain imaging studies to date commonly sacrifice valuable information regarding the individual real-time conscious experience , especially when focusing on elucidating the amygdala 's activity .
22432905|Here , we assumed that by using a minimally intrusive cue along with applying a robust clustering approach to probe the amygdala , it would be possible to rate fear in real time and to derive the related network of activation .
22432905|Using graph theory and community mathematical concepts , data-driven clustering of the fear-related functional cliques in the amygdala was performed guided by the individually marked periods of heightened fear .
22432905|Individually tailored functions derived from these amygdala activation cliques were subsequently applied as general linear model predictors to a whole-brain analysis to reveal the correlated networks .
22432905|Our results suggest that by using a localized robust clustering approach , it is possible to probe activation in the right dorsal amygdala that is directly related to individual real-time emotional experience .
22432905|Moreover , this fear-evoked amygdala revealed two opposing networks of co-activation and co-deactivation , which correspond to vigilance and rest-related circuits , respectively .
22432955|Prior neuroimaging studies have indicated that BPD patients have -LRB- 1 -RRB- excessive amygdala activation to negative emotion and -LRB- 2 -RRB- diminished frontal regulation .
22432955|This study examined amygdala functional connectivity in 12 women with BPD and 12 matched healthy comparison volunteers .
22432955|In comparison to their healthy counterparts , young women with BPD showed -LRB- 1 -RRB- lower connectivity between bilateral amygdala and mid-cingulate cortex during the neutral scan ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- higher connectivity between bilateral amygdala and rostral anterior cingulate cortex during the overt fear scan ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- higher right amygdala connectivity with bilateral thalamus and right caudate during the masked fear scan .
22432955|Exploratory analyses revealed interesting correlations between amygdala connectivity in these conditions with multiple clinical measures .
22432955|However , the connectivity findings during fear processing are novel , and map onto basic research models for amygdala connectivity , that is , connections to frontal areas for overt fear processing versus connections to thalamus for automatic fear processing .
22433048|In the human study , we find that -LRB- 1 -RRB- the percentage of NFC connections among all connections between brain regions significantly correlates with spatial Euclidian distance ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the strength of the NFC between the right amygdala and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is significantly correlated with the SPL across the 20 human subjects ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- such a significant relationship between the NFC and SPL exists in all the NFC connections in the whole brain ; and -LRB- 4 -RRB- the correlations between the NFC and SPL also are frequency bandwidth dependent .
22434239|In a functional MRI study on 7 - to 9-year-old children , we showed that math anxiety was associated with hyperactivity in right amygdala regions that are important for processing negative emotions .
22434239|Multivariate classification analysis revealed distinct multivoxel activity patterns , which were independent of overall activation levels in the right amygdala .
22434239|Furthermore , effective connectivity between the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex regions that regulate negative emotions was elevated in children with math anxiety .
22450197|This valence-specificity was particularly evident for the amygdala .
22450197|For negative emotion , women exhibited greater activation than men in the left amygdala , as well as in other regions including the left thalamus , hypothalamus , mammillary bodies , left caudate , and medial prefrontal cortex .
22450197|In contrast , for positive emotion , men exhibited greater activation than women in the left amygdala , as well as greater activation in other regions including the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus and right fusiform gyrus .
22450197|These meta-analysis findings indicate that the amygdala , a key region for emotion processing , exhibits valence-dependent sex differences in activation to emotional stimuli .
22450197|The greater left amygdala response to negative emotion for women accords with previous reports that women respond more strongly to negative emotional stimuli , as well as with hypothesized links between increased neurobiological reactivity to negative emotion and increased prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders in women .
22450197|The finding of greater left amygdala activation for positive emotional stimuli in men suggests that greater amygdala responses reported previously for men for specific types of positive stimuli may also extend to positive stimuli more generally .
22468617|In the study reported here , functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- was used to measure activity in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex of 10 participants who completed two independent tasks of emotion regulation-reappraisal , measuring intentional emotion regulation , and affect labeling , measuring incidental emotion regulation-with the objective of identifying potential overlap in the neural substrates underlying each task .
22468617|Analyses focused on a priori regions of interest in the amygdala and inferior frontal gyrus -LRB- IFG -RRB- .
22468617|For both tasks , fMRI showed decreased amygdala activation during emotion regulation compared with emotion conditions .
22468617|During reappraisal , this decrease in amygdala activation was accompanied by a proportional decrease in emotional intensity ratings ; during affect labeling , the decrease in amygdala activation correlated with self-reported aggression .
22468617|Importantly , across participants , the magnitude of decrease in amygdala activation during reappraisal correlated with the magnitude of decrease during affect labeling , even though the tasks were administered on separate days , and values indexing amygdala activation during each task were extracted independently of one another .
22468617|In addition , IFG-amygdala connectivity , assessed via psychophysiological interaction analysis , overlapped between tasks in two regions within the right IFG .
22468617|The results suggest that the two tasks recruit overlapping regions of prefrontal cortex , resulting in similar reductions in amygdala activation , regardless of the strategy employed .
22470326|Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- studies indicate agents used to treat anxiety , e.g. , SSRIs and benzodiazepines , attenuate amygdala , insula , and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- activation during emotional processing .
22470326|Our prior study has shown that during anticipation of an emotional stimulus , pregabalin attenuates amygdala and insula activation but increases medial PFC activation .
22470326|In this study , we examined whether , similar to SSRIs and benzodiazepines , pregabalin attenuates amygdala , insula , and medial PFC during emotional face processing .
22470326|Linear mixed model analysis revealed that pregabalin dose-dependently attenuated left amygdala activation during fearful face-matching and left anterior insula activation during angry face-matching .
22470326|Thus , pregabalin shares some similarity to SSRIs and benzodiazepines in attenuating anger and fear-related insula and amygdala activation during emotional face processing .
22475553|MAP2 , SYN , and APOE mRNA and protein levels in the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- , hippocampus , and amygdala , were assessed using qRT-PCR and western blot .
22475553|In the amygdala , bold monkeys had higher levels of MAP2 and SYN mRNA than reserved monkeys .
22475553|MAP2 mRNA correlated positively with amygdala size on the right , left , and combined left and right sides , while SYN mRNA levels correlated positively with the size of the right amygdala .
22484206|The most informative FC was between right amygdala and precuneus , which increased during subliminal fear conditions , while left and right amygdala FC decreased , suggesting a bilateral decoupling of this key limbic region during processing of subliminal fear-related stimuli .
22488255|The effect of the serotonin transporter polymorphism -LRB- 5-HTTLPR -RRB- on amygdala function : a meta-analysis .
22488255|Consistent with this , this polymorphism has been associated with altered amygdala responses at rest and in response to aversive stimuli .
22488255|We sought to synthesize existing data on the association between the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and amygdala activation and ascertain the strength of evidence for this association .
22488255|Our meta-analysis indicated that there is a statistically significant but small effect of 5-HTTLPR on left and right amygdala activity .
22488255|These findings indicate that the association between the 5-HTTLPR and amygdala activation is smaller than originally thought , and that the majority of previous studies have been considerably under powered to reliably demonstrate an effect of this size .
22508768|Tickling that was accompanied by involuntary laughter activated regions in the lateral hypothalamus , parietal operculum , amygdala , and right cerebellum to a consistently greater degree than did the 2 other conditions .
22519463|A case of hyperthymesia : rethinking the role of the amygdala in autobiographical memory .
22519463|brandon.ally@vanderbilt.edu Much controversy has been focused on the extent to which the amygdala belongs to the autobiographical memory -LRB- AM -RRB- core network .
22519463|Early evidence suggested the amygdala played a vital role in emotional processing , likely helping to encode emotionally charged stimuli .
22519463|However , recent work has highlighted the amygdala 's role in social and self-referential processing , leading to speculation that the amygdala likely supports the encoding and retrieval of AM .
22519463|Right amygdala hypertrophy -LRB- approximately 20 % -RRB- and enhanced amygdala-to-hippocampus connectivity -LRB- > 10 SDs -RRB- was observed in this volunteer relative to controls .
22519463|Based on these findings and previous literature , we speculate that the amygdala likely charges AMs with emotional , social , and self-relevance .
22522735|The maltreated youth revealed significantly decreased activation in the left middle frontal gyrus and right precentral gyrus to target stimuli and significantly increased activation to sad stimuli in bilateral amygdala , left subgenual cingulate , left inferior frontal gyrus , and right middle temporal cortex compared to nonmaltreated subjects .
22525015|The hippocampus , basolateral amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex participate in the extinction of inhibitory avoidance and contextual fear conditioning .

22528231|Effect of adenosine A2A receptor antagonist ZM241385 on amygdala-kindled seizures and progression of amygdala kindling .
22528231|lixiang54120@163.com The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of adenosine A2A receptor antagonist ZM241385 on amygdala-kindled seizures and its roles in epileptogenesis .
22528231|Electrodes were implanted into the right amygdala of male adult Wistar rats .
22528231|Kindling was accomplished by using stimulus strength of 500 ?A applied daily to the amygdala until 10 consecutive stage 5 seizues were induced .
22528231|The results showed that , in fully amygdala-kindled rats , ZM241385 -LRB- 0.001-0 .1 nmol/L -RRB- decreased afterdischage duration -LRB- ADD -RRB- , motor seizure duration -LRB- MSD -RRB- , stage 5 duration -LRB- S5D -RRB- and seizure duration -LRB- SD -RRB- , but only the effect on ADD was dose-dependent .
22528231|In contrast to the results in fully amygdala-kindled rats , ZM241385 -LRB- 0.001-0 .1 nmol/L -RRB- had minimal or no effects on the progression of amygdala-kindled seizures .
22528231|We are led to the conclusion that although ZM241385 had no influence on the progression of amygdala-kindled seizures , it had potent anti-convulsant profile and little adverse effects at the dosage of 0.001-0 .1 nmol/L , suggesting that the agent is effective against the amygdala-kindled seizures .
22529357|Maternal cortisol over the course of pregnancy and subsequent child amygdala and hippocampus volumes and affective problems .
22529357|A prospective , longitudinal study was conducted in 65 normal , healthy mother-child dyads to examine the association of maternal cortisol in early , mid - , and late gestation with subsequent measures at approximately 7 y age of child amygdala and hippocampus volume and affective problems .
22529357|After accounting for the effects of potential confounding pre - and postnatal factors , higher maternal cortisol levels in earlier but not later gestation was associated with a larger right amygdala volume in girls -LRB- a 1 SD increase in cortisol was associated with a 6.4 % increase in right amygdala volume -RRB- , but not in boys .
22529357|Moreover , higher maternal cortisol levels in early gestation was associated with more affective problems in girls , and this association was mediated , in part , by amygdala volume .
22529357|The current findings represent , to the best of our knowledge , the first report linking maternal stress hormone levels in human pregnancy with subsequent child amygdala volume and affect .
22535257|Differing amygdala responses to facial expressions in children and adults with bipolar disorder .
22535257|OBJECTIVE : Child and adult bipolar patients show both behavioral deficits in face emotion processing and abnormal amygdala activation .
22535257|However , amygdala function in pediatric relative to adult bipolar patients has not been compared directly .
22535257|The authors used functional MRI to compare amygdala activity during a face processing task in children and adults with bipolar disorder and in healthy comparison subjects .
22535257|RESULTS : In response to fearful faces , bipolar patients across age groups exhibited right amygdala hyperactivity relative to healthy volunteers .
22535257|However , when responses to all facial expressions were combined , pediatric patients exhibited greater right amygdala activation than bipolar adults and healthy children .
22535257|However , compared with bipolar adults and healthy child volunteers , pediatric bipolar patients showed amygdala hyperactivity in response to a broad array of emotional faces .
22535257|Thus , abnormal amygdala activation during face processing appears to be more pervasive in children than in adults with bipolar disorder .
22553009|RESULTS : The PTSS group showed significantly greater activation than controls in several regions , including the amygdala/hippocampus , medial prefrontal cortex , insula , and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex , and less activation than controls in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- .
22553009|Post hoc analyses showed significant Group  Phase interactions in the right amygdala and left hippocampus .
22569152|The hippocampus and amygdala were manually traced on MRI scans in all participants .
22569152|Stepwise regression analyses were conducted with total intracranial volume -LRB- ICV -RRB- , age , and pubertal status as the predictor variables and hippocampus and amygdala volumes as outcome variables .
22569152|Pubertal status was significantly associated with left amygdala volume , after controlling for both age and ICV .
22569152|In addition , puberty was related to right hippocampus and amygdala volumes , after controlling for ICV .
22569152|In contrast , no significant associations were found between age and hippocampal and amygdala volumes after controlling for pubertal status and ICV .
22569152|These findings highlight the importance of the relation between pubertal status and morphometry of the hippocampus and amygdala , and of limbic and subcortical structures that have been implicated in emotional and social behaviors .
22571805|Heterogeneity of amygdala response in major depressive disorder : the impact of lifetime subthreshold mania .
22571805|We aimed to examine whether individual differences in amygdala activity to emotionally salient stimuli were related to heterogeneity in lifetime levels of depressive and subthreshold manic symptoms among adults with MDD .
22571805|Region of interest analyses examined group differences in amygdala activity .
22571805|For conditions in which adults with MDD displayed abnormal amygdala activity versus HC , within-group analyses examined amygdala activity as a function of scores on a continuous measure of lifetime depression-related and mania-related pathology .
22571805|RESULTS : Adults with MDD showed significantly greater right-sided amygdala activity to angry and happy conditions than HC -LRB- p < 0.05 , corrected -RRB- .
22571805|Multiple regression analyses revealed that greater right-amygdala activity to the happy condition in adults with MDD was associated with higher levels of subthreshold manic symptoms experienced across the lifespan -LRB- p = 0.002 -RRB- .
22571805|CONCLUSIONS : Among depressed adults with MDD , lifetime features of subthreshold mania were associated with abnormally elevated amygdala activity to emerging happy faces .
22574175|5-HTTLPR polymorphism impacts task-evoked and resting-state activities of the amygdala in Han Chinese .
22574175|BACKGROUND : Prior research has shown that the amygdala of carriers of the short allele -LRB- s -RRB- of the serotonin transporter -LRB- 5-HTT -RRB- gene -LRB- 5-HTTLPR -RRB- have a larger response to negative emotional stimuli and higher spontaneous activity during the resting state than non-carriers .
22574175|Compared with the s/s group , the l/l group showed significantly increased regional homogeneity or local synchronization in the right amygdala during the resting state -LRB- | t | > 2.028 , p < 0.05 , corrected -RRB- , but no significant difference was found in the bilateral amygdala in response to negative stimuli in the emotional processing task .
22574175|CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE : 5-HTTLPR can alter the spontaneous activity of the amygdala in Han Chinese .
22574175|However , the effect of 5-HTTLPR on the amygdala both in task state and resting state in Asian population was no similar with Caucasians .
22574175|They suggest that the effect of 5-HTTLPR on the amygdala may be modulated by ethnic differences .
2288776|Glutamate concentration was significantly higher in the S6 group than in the Sh group in CSF and less in the S6 group than in the Sh group in the left and right amygdala , hippocampus and piriform cortex .
23827067|RESULTS : The brain regions of functional connectivity related with MrD were located in bilateral middle cingulate gyrus , rolandic operculum , insula , putamen , thalamus and amygdala in male group , and in bilateral heschl gyrus , putamen , thalamus and amygdala in female group.The brain regions with increased functional connectivity related with MrD were demonstrated in right superior temporal gyrus , middle temporal gyrus and gyrus rectus , and decreased in left superior parietal cortex in male group compared with that in female group .
23827769|Disrupted amygdala-prefrontal functional connectivity in civilian women with posttraumatic stress disorder .
23827769|Central to the neurocircuitry regulating emotion are functional interactions between the amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- .
23827769|However , only a few studies have examined amygdala-vmPFC connectivity in the context of emotional processing in PTSD .
23827769|The aim of the present research was to investigate the hypothesis that PTSD is associated with disrupted functional connectivity of the amygdala and vmPFC in response to emotional stimuli , extending previous findings by demonstrating such links in an understudied , highly traumatized , civilian population .
23827769|Relative to controls , participants with PTSD showed an increased right amygdala response to fearful stimuli -LRB- p -LRB- corr -RRB- < .05 -RRB- .
23827769|Right amygdala activation correlated positively with the severity of hyperarousal symptoms in the PTSD group .
23827769|Participants with PTSD showed decreased functional connectivity between the right amygdala and left vmPFC -LRB- p -LRB- corr -RRB- < .05 -RRB- .
23827769|The findings are consistent with previous findings showing PTSD is associated with an exaggerated response of amygdala-mediated emotional arousal systems .
23827769|This is the first study to show that the amygdala response may be accompanied by disruption of an amygdala-vmPFC functional circuit that is hypothesized to be involved in prefrontal cortical regulation of amygdala responsivity .
23841808|RESULTS : -LSB- Sucrose > water -RSB- provoked a significant BOLD activation in primary gustatory cortex and amygdala , as well as in the right ventral striatum and in bilateral orbitofrontal cortex .
23851067|Altered amygdala connectivity within the social brain in schizophrenia .
23851067|Effective connectivity from the amygdala was estimated using the psychophysiological interaction approach .
23851067|RESULTS : While making approachability judgments , healthy participants recruited a network of social brain regions including amygdala , fusiform gyrus , cerebellum , and inferior frontal gyrus bilaterally and left medial prefrontal cortex .
23851067|During the approachability task , healthy participants showed increased connectivity from the amygdala to the fusiform gyri , cerebellum , and left superior frontal cortex .
23851067|In comparison to controls , individuals with schizophrenia overactivated the right middle frontal gyrus , superior frontal gyrus , and precuneus and had reduced connectivity between the amygdala and the insula cortex .
23851067|DISCUSSION : We report increased activation of frontal and medial parietal regions during social judgment in patients with schizophrenia , accompanied by decreased connectivity between the amygdala and insula .
23851067|We suggest that the increased activation of frontal control systems and association cortex may reflect a compensatory mechanism for impaired connectivity of the amygdala with other parts of the social brain networks in schizophrenia .
23861318|Source estimations over these 2 time periods further revealed decreased activity in response to both neutral and fearful faces within limbic areas , including amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus , and the right temporal cortex over the 168-189 ms interval , and reduced activity in response to happy faces within limbic and right temporo-occipital brain areas over the 211-242 ms interval .
23872141|The role of the amygdala and the basal ganglia in visual processing of central vs. peripheral emotional content .
23872141|Moreover , task instructions have been shown to modulate brain regions involved in threat recognition -LRB- e.g. the amygdala -RRB- .
23872141|Here we have addressed the role of central vs. peripheral processing in the human amygdala using animal threatening vs. non-threatening face stimuli .
23872141|We found lateralized amygdala responses both to the spatial location of stimuli and to the threatening content of faces depending on the task performed : the right amygdala showed increased responses to central compared to left presented stimuli specifically during the threat detection task , while the left amygdala was better prone to discriminate threatening faces from non-facial displays during the animal face recognition task .
23872141|Additionally , the right amygdala responded to faces during the threat detection task but only when centrally presented .
23872141|Moreover , we have found no evidence for superior responses of the amygdala to peripheral stimuli .
23872141|We conclude that the human amygdala has a central bias for face stimuli , and that visual processing recruits different striatal regions , putaminal or caudate based , depending on the task and on whether peripheral or central visual processing is involved .
23878359|RESULTS : The relative volumes of the left hippocampus , right amygdala , bilateral thalamus , right caudate , left putamen , and bilateral pallidum were significantly lower in the early-stage AD group than in the control group -LRB- P < 0.05 -RRB- .
23880959|CACNA1C genotype explains interindividual differences in amygdala volume among patients with schizophrenia .
23880959|Affective deficits are one common denominator of schizophrenia -LRB- SZ -RRB- , bipolar disorder -LRB- BD -RRB- and obsessive compulsive disorder -LRB- OCD -RRB- with the amygdala indicated as one of the major structures involved in emotion regulation .
23880959|Previous findings of differences in amygdala volume between healthy controls and patients with SZ , BD or OCD diverge with respect to the affected hemisphere , size and direction of the effect .
23880959|Variability in the CACNA1C gene has been linked to BD , SZ as well as structural and functional variation in the amygdala in healthy people and patients with BD .
23880959|We were interested to investigate whether amygdala volumes differ between hemispheres , diagnostic or genotype groups , and whether any interactive effects exist .
23880959|We combined genotyping of SNP rs1006737 in CACNA1C with structural MRI measurements of relative gray matter -LRB- GM -RRB- amygdala volume in patients with SZ , BD or OCD as well as healthy controls -LRB- N Total = 72 -RRB- .
23880959|The CACNA1C genotype showed a significant effect on relative GM amygdala volume in patients with SZ .
23880959|There was a significant left versus right relative GM amygdala volume decrease in patients with SZ or BD .
23880959|The effects of hemisphere and diagnosis -LRB- controls vs. patients with SZ -RRB- on relative GM amygdala volume were genotype specific .
23880959|Our data suggest that the CACNA1C genotype may account for some heterogeneity in the effects of hemisphere and diagnosis on amygdala volume when comparing patients with SZ and controls and point to disturbed Ca -LRB- 2 + -RRB- - signaling as a plausible mechanism contributing to the pathology in patients with SZ .
23886515|During the processing of negative emotional stimuli , alexithymia was associated with a diminished response of the amygdala , suggesting decreased attention to such stimuli .
23887820|We found that confrontation with self-critical material yielded neural activity in regions involved in emotions -LRB- anterior insula/hippocampus-amygdala formation -RRB- and in anterior and posterior cortical midline structures , which are associated with self-referential and autobiographical memory processing .
23890738|Cortical thickness , cortico-amygdalar networks , and externalizing behaviors in healthy children .
23890738|BACKGROUND : Fronto-amygdalar networks are implicated in childhood psychiatric disorders characterized by high rates of externalizing -LRB- aggressive , noncompliant , oppositional -RRB- behavior .
23890738|Here , we studied cortical thickness , amygdala volume , and cortico-amygdalar network correlates of externalizing behavior in a large sample of healthy children .
23890738|Relationships between externalizing behaviors -LRB- measured with the Child Behavior Checklist -RRB- and cortical thickness , amygdala volume , and cortico-amygdalar structural networks were examined using first-order linear mixed-effects models , after controlling for age , sex , scanner , and total brain volume .
23890738|Although amygdala volume alone was not correlated with externalizing behaviors , an orbitofrontal cortex-amygdala network predicted rates of externalizing behavior .
23890738|Children with lower levels of externalizing behaviors exhibited positive correlations between orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala structure , while these regions were not correlated in children with higher levels of externalizing behavior .
23890738|CONCLUSIONS : Our findings identify key cortical nodes in frontal , cingulate , and temporal cortex associated with externalizing behaviors in children ; and indicate that orbitofrontal-amygdala network properties may influence externalizing behaviors , along a continuum and across healthy and clinical samples .
23894310|Our statistical tests pinpointed this gender-specificity to the right amygdala -LRB- strongest in the superficial nuclei -RRB- .
23906596|All face-sensitive areas identified -LRB- superior temporal sulcus , inferior occipital cortex , anterior infero-temporal cortex , amygdala -RRB- were strongly right-lateralized in left-handers , this right lateralization bias being as large as in a population of right-handers -LRB- 40 -RRB- tested with the same paradigm -LRB- Rossion et al. , 2012 -RRB- .
23911256|Altered amygdala activation in schizophrenia patients during emotion processing .
23911256|Schizophrenia patients revealed stronger right amygdala activation during negative and attenuated response during positive affective picture processing compared to healthy controls .
23922638|We hypothesized that the caudate -LRB- dorsal striatum -RRB- and putamen -LRB- ventral striatum -RRB- and amygdala would signal differential reputations during decision-making .
23922849|TA was performed upon 3D volumes of interest that were placed bilaterally in the thalamus , amygdala , hippocampus , caudate nucleus and putamen .
23932915|The amygdala , as part of the limbic system , is involved in emotion and reward , and the insula in interoception .
23932915|The right amygdala activation was inversely related to BMI , consistent with greater gastric capacity at a higher BMI .
23937918|RESULTS : Compared with control subjects , adolescents with IGA showed significantly higher global CBF in the left inferior temporal lobe/fusiform gyrus , left parahippocampal gyrus/amygdala , right medial frontal lobe/anterior cingulate cortex , left insula , right insula , right middle temporal gyrus , right precentral gyrus , left supplementary motor area , left cingulate gyrus , and right inferior parietal lobe .
23946000|Based on high-resolution magnetic resonance images of 96 young adults voxel-based morphometry was used to analyze the gray matter volumes of the a priori regions of interest , including amygdala , insula , dorsal anterior cingulate and paracingulate cortex , medial and lateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- and their association with cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression usage as well as neuroticism .
23946000|A positive association of cognitive reappraisal with right and tendentially left amygdala volume and of neuroticism with left amygdala volume -LRB- marginally significant -RRB- was found .
23946000|The results of this study emphasize the important role of the amygdala in individual differences in cognitive reappraisal usage as well as neuroticism .
23946006|Effects of gaze direction , head orientation and valence of facial expression on amygdala activity .
23946006|There is increasing evidence for a role of the amygdala in processing gaze direction and emotional relevance of faces .
23946006|In this event-related functional magnetic resonance study we investigated amygdala responses while we orthogonally manipulated head direction , gaze direction and facial expression -LRB- angry , happy and neutral -RRB- .
23946006|This allowed us to investigate effects of stimulus ambiguity , low-level factors and non-emotional factors on amygdala activation .
23946006|Averted vs direct gaze induced increased activation in the right dorsal amygdala regardless of facial expression and head orientation .
23946006|Furthermore , valence effects were found in the ventral amygdala and strongly dependent on head orientation .
23946006|We observed enhanced activation to angry and neutral vs happy faces for observer-directed faces in the left ventral amygdala while the averted head condition reversed this pattern resulting in increased activation to happy as compared to angry and neutral faces .
23946006|These results suggest that gaze direction drives specifically dorsal amygdala activation regardless of facial expression , low-level perceptual factors or stimulus ambiguity .
23946006|The role of the amygdala is thus not restricted to the detection of potential threat , but has a more general role in attention processes .
23946006|Furthermore , valence effects are associated with activation of the ventral amygdala and strongly influenced by non-emotional factors .
23948645|Outside of the FFA , the most striking finding was that children hyperactivated nearly every aspect of the extended face system relative to adults , including the amygdala , anterior temporal pole , insula , inferior frontal gyrus , anterior cingulate gyrus , and parietal cortex .
23953332|Compared with healthy controls , SAD patients showed significantly lower GMD in the bilateral thalami , right amygdala , and right precuneus .
23953332|Furthermore , the GMD in the right amygdala was negatively related to the disease duration , but positively correlated with age of onset .
23962922|The CG relative to the CC group also showed greater activation of limbic and midbrain regions during stress and cues relative to the neutral condition with additional stress-induced activation in the right amygdala/hippocampus -LRB- P < 0.05 , whole-brain corrected -RRB- .
23965122|Areas showing consistent decreases during active tasks included posterior cingulate/precuneous -LRB- Brodmann area , BA 31/7 -RRB- , left -LRB- BAS 40 and 39/19 -RRB- and right -LRB- BA 40 -RRB- inferior parietal cortex , left dorsolateral frontal cortex -LRB- BA S -RRB- , left lateral inferior frontal cortex -LRB- BA 10/47 -RRB- , left inferior temporal gyrus @A 20 -RRB- , a strip of medial frontal regions running along a dorsal-ventral axis -LRB- BAs 8 , 9 , 10 , and 32 -RRB- , and the right amygdala .
23968960|Prenatal maternal depression associates with microstructure of right amygdala in neonates at birth .
23968960|BACKGROUND : Antenatal maternal cortisol levels associate with alterations in the amygdala , a structure associated with emotion regulation , in the offspring .
23968960|This study aimed to examine the association between antenatal maternal depressive symptomatology and neonatal amygdala volume and microstructure and thus establish evidence for the transgenerational transmission of vulnerability for affective disorders during prenatal development .
23968960|Structural magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging were performed with 157 nonsedated , 6 - to 14-day-old newborns and then analyzed to extract the volume , fractional anisotropy , and axial diffusivity values of the amygdala .
23968960|RESULTS : Adjusting for household income , maternal age , and smoking exposure , postconceptual age at magnetic resonance imaging , and birth weight , we found significantly lower fractional anisotropy -LRB- p = .009 -RRB- and axial diffusivity -LRB- p = .028 -RRB- , but not volume -LRB- p = .993 -RRB- , in the right amygdala in the infants of mothers with high compared with those with low-normal Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores .
23968960|CONCLUSIONS : The results reveal a significant relation between antenatal maternal depression and the neonatal microstructure of the right amygdala , a brain region closely associated with stress reactivity and vulnerability for mood anxiety disorders .
23969000|Within the frontocingulate network , Posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- severity was associated with weakened functional connectivity between the left amygdala and the perigenual anterior cingulate .
23974947|Tension-related activity in the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala : an fMRI study with music .
23974947|In addition , a region of interest analysis in bilateral amygdala showed activation in the right superficial amygdala during periods of increasing tension -LRB- compared with decreasing tension -RRB- .
23977455|Elevated amygdala responses to emotional faces in youths with chronic irritability or bipolar disorder .
23977455|Amygdala dysfunction during face emotion processing is well-documented in BD , but little is known about amygdala dysfunction in chronically irritable youth .
23977455|In the right amygdala , both SMD and BD exhibited greater activity across all expressions than HV .
23977455|Thus , during implicit face emotion processing , youth with BD and those with SMD exhibit similar amygdala dysfunction but different abnormalities in regions involved in information monitoring and integration .
23981357|Emotion regulation has been associated with amygdala and rostral anterior cingulate -LRB- rACC -RRB- .
23981357|A preliminary examination of functional connectivity of rACC and right amygdala was conducted in adolescents 2 to 3 years after moderate to severe TBI and in typically developing -LRB- TD -RRB- control adolescents , with the hypothesis that the TBI adolescents would demonstrate altered functional connectivity in the two regions .
23981357|Functional connectivity was determined by correlating fluctuations in the blood oxygen level dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- signal of the rACC and right amygdala with that of other brain regions .
23981357|In the TBI adolescents , the rACC was found to be significantly less functionally connected to medial prefrontal cortices and to right temporal regions near the amygdala -LRB- height threshold T = 2.5 , cluster level p < .05 , FDR corrected -RRB- , while the right amygdala showed a trend in reduced functional connectivity with the rACC -LRB- height threshold T = 2.5 , cluster level p = .06 , FDR corrected -RRB- .
23982225|RESULTS : At baseline , nonresponders exhibited enhanced activation in the right pregenual anterior cingulate cortex , the hippocampus , and the amygdala in response to a safety signal .
23982225|Treatment response was associated with an inhibitory functional coupling between the anterior cingulate cortex and the amygdala that did not change over time .
23982225|Altered safety signal processing and anterior cingulate cortex-amygdala coupling may indicate individual differences among these patients that determine the effectiveness of exposure-based CBT and associated neuroplastic changes .
23983264|This treatment also enhanced in vivo acetylcholinergic activity in the frontal cortex , hippocampus , and amygdala but reduced NK3-R mRNA expression in the hippocampus .
23986266|5-HTTLPR , anxiety and gender interaction moderates right amygdala volume in healthy subjects .
23986266|In addition , a three-way significant interaction among genotype , gender and anxiety category was found for the right amygdala volume .
23986266|The reported interaction effects demonstrate that gender strongly modulates the relationship between 5-HTTLPR genotype and subclinical expression of anxiety acting on amygdala , one region of the emotional neural network specifically involved in the anxiety-like behaviours .
23986672|Bilateral amygdala , middle occipital gyrus and fusiform gyrus were activated across both tasks .
23986672|While masking tasks were more associated with inferior temporal gyrus , parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala , inattention tasks were more associated with right fusiform gyrus .
23990890|Positive facial affect - an fMRI study on the involvement of insula and amygdala .
23990890|Imitation of facial expressions engages the putative human mirror neuron system as well as the insula and the amygdala as part of the limbic system .
23990890|Differences in brain activation of the amygdala and insula were additionally examined during observation and execution of facial expressions .
23990890|During imitation , higher right hemispheric activation emerged in the happy compared to the non-emotional condition in the right anterior insula and the right amygdala , in addition to the pre-supplementary motor area , middle temporal gyrus and the inferior frontal gyrus .
23990890|Region-of-interest analyses revealed that the right insula was more strongly recruited by -LRB- i -RRB- imitation and execution than by observation of facial expressions , that -LRB- ii -RRB- the insula was significantly stronger activated by happy than by non-emotional facial expressions during observation and imitation and that -LRB- iii -RRB- the activation differences in the right amygdala between happy and non-emotional facial expressions were increased during imitation and execution , in comparison to sole observation .
23990890|We suggest that the insula and the amygdala contribute specifically to the happy emotional connotation of the facial expressions depending on the task .
23990890|The activation specific for the happy facial expression of the amygdala during motor tasks , but not in the observation condition , might reflect increased autonomic activity or feedback from facial muscles to the amygdala .
24004849|We then used unbiased stereology to estimate the total number and proportion of neurons immunoreactive for the immediate early gene product Fos bilaterally in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , the anterior and posterior subdivisions of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis , and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus -LRB- PVN -RRB- .
24009565|Laboratory-based episodic memory studies , using micro-events -LRB- pictures/words -RRB- , point to a role of the amygdala -LRB- AMY -RRB- , an emotion-based region , in the encoding and retrieval of emotionally valenced memories .
24023269|Binding potentials -LRB- BP -RRB- at nucleus accumbens , amygdala , orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- VMPFC -RRB- , putamen and caudate nucleus were estimated , and whole brain parametric maps of -LSB- -LRB- 18 -RRB- F -RSB- - FP-CIT binding were analysed by original and putaminal normalised manners .
24033581|While amygdala volume did not change over time , the left hemisphere was consistently larger than the right .
24036129|Functional connectivity abnormalities vary by amygdala subdivision and are associated with psychiatric symptoms in unilateral temporal epilepsy .
24036129|The amygdala has been described as a structure affected by mesial temporal lobe epilepsy -LRB- MTLE -RRB- .
24036129|Indeed , it is suggested that amygdala abnormalities are related to the co-morbid depression and anxiety reported in MTLE .
24036129|We focused on resting-state BOLD activity and evaluated whether FC differences emerge from each of three amygdala subdivisions -LRB- laterobasal , centromedial and superficial -RRB- in left and right MTLE groups , compared with healthy controls .
24036129|Overall , our data demonstrate that right TLE has a more maladaptive impact on emotion-related networks , in ways specific to the amygdala region , and the emotion symptom involved , than left TLE .
24039023|On the functional neurobiological level , specific brain regions involved in the processing of anxiety-laden stimuli and in emotion regulation have been shown to be hyperactive and hyper-responsive in SAD such as amygdala , insula and orbito - and prefrontal cortex .
24040190|MEG evidence for dynamic amygdala modulations by gaze and facial emotions .
24040190|While the role of amygdala in the perception of facial emotion and gaze has been extensively highlighted with fMRI , the unfolding in time of amydgala responses to emotional versus neutral faces with different gaze directions is scarcely known .
24040190|METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS : Here we addressed this question in healthy subjects using MEG combined with an original source imaging method based on individual amygdala volume segmentation and the localization of sources in the amygdala volume .
24040190|We found an early peak of amygdala activity that was enhanced for fearful relative to neutral faces between 130 and 170 ms. The effect of emotion was again significant in a later time range -LRB- 310-350 ms -RRB- .
24040190|Moreover , the amygdala response was greater for direct relative averted gaze between 190 and 350 ms , and this effect was selective of fearful faces in the right amygdala .
24040190|CONCLUSION : Altogether , our results show that the amygdala is involved in the processing and integration of emotion and gaze cues from faces in different time ranges , thus underlining its role in multiple stages of face perception .
24040385|Abnormal functional connectivity of amygdala in late-onset depression was associated with cognitive deficits .
24040385|Abnormal functional connectivity -LRB- FC -RRB- with the amygdala , which is involved in cortico-limbic circuits , has also been observed in MDD .
24040385|Regional homogeneity -LRB- ReHo -RRB- and FC with bilateral amygdala seeds were used to analyze blood oxygen level-dependent fMRI data between two groups .
24040385|In the LOD group , the left amygdala had decreased FC with the right middle frontal gyrus and the left superior frontal gyrus in the amygdala positive network , and it had increased FC with the right post-central gyrus in the amygdala negative network .
24040385|However , significantly reduced FC with the right amygdala was observed in the right middle occipital gyrus in the amygdala negative network .
24040385|Further correlative analyses revealed that decreased FC between the amygdala and the right middle occipital gyrus was negatively correlated with the verbal fluency test -LRB- VFT , r = -0.485 , P = 0.022 -RRB- and the digit span test -LRB- DST , r = -0.561 , P = 0.007 -RRB- .
24040385|CONCLUSIONS : Our findings of reduced activity of the prefrontal gyrus and abnormal FC with the bilateral amygdala may be key markers of cognitive dysfunction in LOD patients .
24044427|During congruent responses to JA bids , we observed increased activation in the right amygdala , the right fusiform gyrus , anterior and dorsal anterior cingulate cortices , striatum , ventral tegmental area , and posterior parietal cortices .
24051900|Functional magnetic resonance imaging results indicated significant associations between CA scores and increased stress-induced activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex , insula , striatum , right amygdala , hippocampus , and temporal regions in all 75 participants -LRB- p < 0.05 , whole-brain corrected -RRB- .
24059042|-LSB- MR spectroscopy of amygdala : investigation of methodology -RSB- .
24059042|This study was aimed to optimize the methods of magnetic resonance spectroscopy -LRB- MRS -RRB- to improve its quality in amygdala .
24059042|Forty-three volunteers were examined at right and left amygdala using stimulated-echo acquisition mode -LRB- STEAM -RRB- , and point-resolved spectroscopy series -LRB- PRESS -RRB- with and without saturation bands .
24059042|Therefore , PRESS with saturation bands is better than PRESS without saturation bands or STEAM for the spectroscopy of amygdala .
24059962|Discriminative regions for symptoms of depression were the right pulvinar -LRB- happy -RRB- and left amygdala -LRB- sad -RRB- .
24064198|The amygdala is a critical hub in the neural fear network , receptive to change using emotion regulation strategies and a putative target for iCBT .
24064198|A significant differential activation of the left amygdala was found with relatively decreased reactivity after iCBT .
24064198|Changes in the amygdala were related to a behavioral measure of social anxiety .
24064198|Functional connectivity analysis in the iCBT group showed that the amygdala attenuation was associated with increased activity in the medial orbitofrontal cortex and decreased activity in the right ventrolateral and dorsolateral -LRB- dlPFC -RRB- cortices .
24066140|Only in female homozygous carriers of the risk allele we found significant increases of gray matter volume -LRB- GMV -RRB- in the right amygdala , a region known to influence eating behavior , and the right hippocampus , a structure crucial for memory formation and learning .
24067201|RESULTS : A decreased volume was found in the left insular lobe , left nucleus accumbens area , right hippocampus , putamen and amygdala in type 2 diabetic patients compared with normal controls -LRB- P < 0.05 -RRB- .
24069183|In addition , during emotional processing there was an effect of genotype in a cluster including the amygdala and hippocampus .
24069317|MR volumetric study of piriform-cortical amygdala and orbitofrontal cortices : the aging effect .
24069317|INTRODUCTION : The piriform cortex and cortical amygdala -LRB- PCA -RRB- and the orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- are considered olfactory-related brain regions .
24070450|First , compared with the controls , the patients showed significantly increased MD in the right anterior cingulate gyrus -LRB- ACG -RRB- and decreased FA in the right amygdala .
24071915|An interaction between oxytocin and a genetic variation of the oxytocin receptor modulates amygdala activity toward direct gaze : evidence from a pharmacological imaging genetics study .
24071915|Of importance , it has been demonstrated that pronounced amygdala activation could be observed , when participants are confronted with direct gaze pictures in an fMRI setting , an effect that can be particularly observed in autistic individuals .
24071915|The main result revealed that a genetic variation of the OXTR gene -LRB- rs401015 -RRB- modulated the right amygdala activity for the fMRI contrast `` direct > averted gaze '' under the influence of the neuropeptide oxytocin .
24071915|The present study highlights the role of individual differences in a genetic variant of the OXTR gene for amygdala activation during processing of direct gaze pictures after intranasal oxytocin administration .
24074963|Posttraumatic stress -LRB- PTSD -RRB- and alcohol use -LRB- AUD -RRB- disorders are associated with abnormal anterior cingulate cortex/ventromedial prefrontal cortex , thalamus , and amygdala function , yet microstructural white matter -LRB- WM -RRB- differences in executive-limbic tracts are likely also involved .
24075822|A preliminary longitudinal volumetric MRI study of amygdala and hippocampal volumes in autism .
24075822|BACKGROUND : Previous studies suggest that amygdala volume , when compared with healthy controls , is increased in young children with autism , is unchanged in cohorts of older youth , and is smaller in adults .
24075822|The goal of this pilot investigation is to characterize the developmental trajectories of the amygdala and hippocampus in children with autism between the ages of 8 and 14years and to examine clinical correlates of volume change .
24075822|Regression models were used to estimate group differences in amygdala and hippocampal volumes .
24075822|Changes in amygdala and hippocampal volumes -LRB- Time 2-Time 1 -RRB- were correlated with clinical severity measures .
24075822|Within the autism group , right amygdala volume change was correlated with the ability to establish appropriate eye contact .
24075822|CONCLUSION : This study provides preliminary evidence of normalization of amygdala volumes in late childhood and adolescence .
24076048|Relative to HCs , the IBS group had lower volumes in the bilateral superior frontal gyrus , bilateral insula , bilateral amygdala , bilateral hippocampus , bilateral middle orbital frontal gyrus , left cingulate , left gyrus rectus , brainstem , and left putamen .
24076048|Group differences were no longer significant for most regions when controlling for the Early Trauma Inventory global score , with the exception of the right amygdala and the left postcentral gyrus .
24077065|Hippocampal and amygdalar volumetric differences in pathological gambling : a preliminary study of the associations with the behavioral inhibition system .
24077065|The behavioral inhibition system -LRB- BIS -RRB- and behavioral activation system -LRB- BAS -RRB- are hypothesized to underlie motivated behavior , relate to hippocampal and amygdalar function , and link to pathological gambling -LRB- PG -RRB- .
24077065|Prior studies have not investigated hippocampal and amygdalar volumes in PG and their relationships to BIS/BAS measures .
24077065|Volumetric measures of the hippocampus and amygdala were assessed using FreeSurfer and related to BIS/BAS measures .
24077065|PG relative to HC individuals demonstrated diminished volume in the left hippocampus and right amygdala and higher BIS and BAS scores .
24077065|BIS scores were positively correlated with left hippocampal and left amygdalar volumes in PG individuals .
24077065|The findings of relatively diminished hippocampal and amygdalar volumes in PG individuals resonate with findings from substance-dependent groups .
24077065|Relationships between amygdalar and hippocampal volumes and BIS measures in PG suggest that individual differences in these structures may contribute to avoidance behaviors in PG .
24083408|RESULTS : As a group , the patients had lower regional GMV compared to controls in the following regions : basal ganglia , left claustrum , right amygdala , left hippocampus , parietal lobes , and left frontal lobe .
24083408|Those CO patients characterized by DE patients had a lower GMV in the left anterior cingulate and right amygdala , as well as lower levels of cognitive function , than the non-DE patients .
24093010|During the imagine-self perspective , participants with high psychopathy showed a typical response within the network involved in empathy for pain , including the anterior insula -LRB- aINS -RRB- , anterior midcingulate cortex -LRB- aMCC -RRB- , supplementary motor area -LRB- SMA -RRB- , inferior frontal gyrus -LRB- IFG -RRB- , somatosensory cortex , and right amygdala .
24093010|Conversely , during the imagine-other perspective , psychopaths exhibited an atypical pattern of brain activation and effective connectivity seeded in the anterior insula and amygdala with the orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- and ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- .
24093010|The response in the amygdala and insula was inversely correlated with PCL-R Factor 1 -LRB- interpersonal/affective -RRB- during the imagine-other perspective .
24097318|Brain MRI demonstrated high T2/FLAIR signal changes in the left amygdala expanding into the left hippocampus .
24097318|FDG-PET showed hypermetabolism in the left amygdala , hippocampus and the bilateral basal ganglia .
24099849|A specific modeling of feeling misunderstood activated a network consisting of the IFG , left TP , left Heschl gyrus , IFGTr , and right precuneus , extending to several limbic regions , such as the insula , amygdala , putamen , and anterior cingulate cortex/right middle cingulum -LRB- ACC/MCC -RRB- .
24099953|Lower rectal sensory threshold -LRB- ie , increased sensitivity -RRB- correlated significantly with reduced GMV in the thalamus , insula , posterior cingulate cortex , ventrolateral and orbitofrontal prefrontal cortices , amygdala , and basal ganglia -LRB- all PFWE < .05 -RRB- .
24103376|In both datasets , we found significant brain size effects in the right amygdala and the bilateral caudate nucleus and significant gender effects in the bilateral putamen .
24103890|Peri-pubertal gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment affects sex biased gene expression of amygdala in sheep .
24103890|In this study , we explored effects of this treatment regime on the gene expression profile of the ovine amygdala .
24103890|Gene expression profiles of the left and right amygdala were measured using 8  15 K Agilent ovine microarrays .
24103890|GnRHa treatment was associated with differential expression of 432 -LRB- | logFC | > 0.3 , adj. p value < 0.05 -RRB- and 46 -LRB- p value < 0.0.5 -RRB- genes in the left and right amygdala , respectively , of female animals , relative to the reference sample which consisted of all a pooled sample from control and treated animals of both sexes .
24103890|The results indicated that GnRH may , directly and/or indirectly , be involved in the regulation of sex - and hemisphere-specific differential expression of genes in the amygdala .
24108802|Disrupted effective connectivity between the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex in social anxiety disorder during emotion discrimination revealed by dynamic causal modeling for FMRI .
24108802|We used dynamic causal modeling -LRB- DCM -RRB- , a method to evaluate effective connectivity , to test our hypothesis that SAD patients would exhibit dysfunctions in the amygdala-prefrontal emotion regulation network .
24108802|The emotion-processing network was identified by a task-related contrast and motivated the selection of the right amygdala , OFC , and DLPFC for DCM analysis .
24108802|Bayesian model averaging for DCM revealed abnormal connectivity between the OFC and the amygdala in SAD patients .
24108802|In patients , however , positive connectivity from OFC to amygdala was observed , indicating an excitatory connection .
24108802|As we did not observe a group difference of the modulatory influence of the FACE condition on the OFC to amygdala connection , we assume a context-independent reduction of prefrontal control over amygdalar activation in SAD patients .
24111237|Emotional centers including the right amygdala and bilateral insula were activated by the second piece -LRB- emotional attachment -RRB- but not by the first piece .
24111237|Functional subunits with highest interactions were bilateral precuneus for the first piece and left middle frontal gyrus and right amygdala , bilateral insula , left middle temporal gyrus for the second piece .
24126454|Aversive learning in adolescents : modulation by amygdala-prefrontal and amygdala-hippocampal connectivity and neuroticism .
24126454|It is known that this trait modulates fear learning and the activation of brain regions involved in it such as the amygdala , hippocampus , and prefrontal cortex and their connectivity .
24126454|During acquisition -LRB- CS + / - differentiation -RRB- , higher levels of neuroticism were associated with a stronger interaction between the right amygdala and the right hippocampus as well as the right amygdala and prefrontal cortical regions , specifically ventromedial prefrontal cortex , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , and anterior cingulate cortex .
24128735|Repeatability of signal distribution -LRB- spatial repeatability -RRB- and repeatability of signal amplitude within two regions of interest -LRB- amygdala and fusiform gyrus -RRB- were estimated by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient -LRB- ICC -RRB- .
24128735|Significant repeatability of signal amplitude was only found within the right amygdala during the perception of 50 % fearful faces , but disappeared when physiological noise correction was performed .
24128735|Spatial repeatability was higher within the fusiform gyrus than within the amygdala , and better at the group level than at the participant level .
24133426|The amygdala , insula and medial prefrontal cortex exhibited evidence of dimensional -LRB- linear -RRB- processing that correlated with physical changes in the emotional face stimuli .
24137291|The patient underwent resectioning of the right anterior temporal lobe , hippocampus and amygdala , in addition to the lesion located in the medial temporal lobe .
24138217|Developmental variation in amygdala volumes among children with posttraumatic stress .
24138217|This article examined associations between indices of maturation -LRB- age and Tanner stage -RRB- and amygdala volumes in 24 youth -LRB- aged 7-14 -RRB- with posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and a matched control group .
24138217|A positive association between maturation and right amygdala volumes was observed in the trauma group but not in controls .
24138217|Developmentally younger youth -LRB- Tanner stage 1 and 2 -RRB- showed increases and older -LRB- Tanner stage 3 and 4 -RRB- decreases in right amygdala volumes .
24139810|RESULTS : Relative to changes in functional connectivity during the neutral control script , RETM was associated with strengthened functional connectivity of the right amygdala with the right hippocampus and right anterior insular cortex , left amygdala with the right insular cortex , medial PFC with right anterior insula , left hippocampus with striatum and dorsal cingulate cortex , and right hippocampus with striatum and orbitofrontal cortex .
24156808|The human amygdala drives reflexive orienting towards facial features .
24156808|The human amygdala is reliably activated by facial expressions -LSB- 1 -RSB- , but the precise functional relevance of such activity change is not well understood , because most previous studies did not allow for separating effects of the emotional expression from the distribution of specific facial features and neglected corresponding attentional processes .
24156808|Findings on rare patients with bilateral amygdala damage indicate that the amygdala might be involved in triggering shifts of overt attention towards specific facial features such as the eyes -LSB- 2 -RSB- .
24156808|This early attentional bias was linked to amygdala activity -LSB- 4 -RSB- , and was found to be most pronounced for fearful faces and less pronounced for happy facial expressions -LSB- 3,5 -RSB- .
24156808|Here , we examined an otherwise healthy , male adult individual -LRB- MW -RRB- with unilateral right-sided amygdala loss in a novel , eye-tracking-based face perception task in order to clarify the functional role of the amygdala complex in driving attentional orienting .
24156808|These results suggest that the amygdala is implicated in quickly detecting diagnostic facial features in the visual periphery and driving reflexive saccades towards these locations .
24165922|MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Brain volumes of children 's white matter and cortical gray matter , as well as hippocampus and amygdala volumes , obtained using magnetic resonance imaging .
24165922|RESULTS Poverty was associated with smaller white and cortical gray matter and hippocampal and amygdala volumes .
24167496|Functional connectivity analyses revealed connections between seed regions in the left ACC and right insular cortex with reward regions , the amygdala , and frontal regions associated with emotion regulation .
24176688|The hippocampi and amygdalae were selected as seeds , and five prefrontal and five cingulate regions of interest -LRB- ROIs -RRB- were selected as targets .
24176688|Conversely , right amygdala FC was correlated with depressive symptoms in both patient groups , with a positive and negative correlation in LTLE and right TLE -LRB- RTLE -RRB- , respectively .
24176688|In addition , the right amygdala may play a role in depression symptomatology regardless of the side of the epileptogenic focus .
24179291|Self-reported sleep correlates with prefrontal-amygdala functional connectivity and emotional functioning .
24179291|Sleep deprivation is also associated with reduced prefrontal-amygdala functional connectivity , potentially reflecting impaired top-down modulation of emotion .
24179291|Longer sleep was also associated with stronger negative functional connectivity between the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala .
24179291|CONCLUSIONS : Self-reported sleep duration from the preceding night was negatively correlated with prefrontal-amygdala connectivity and the severity of subjective psychological distress , while positively correlated with higher perceived emotional intelligence .
24179788|A region-of-interest analysis showed that during catecholamine depletion versus placebo the combined LR and HR groups displayed a significant increase in cerebral metabolic rate in the left and right ventral striata , left and right amygdalae , and left and right hippocampi -LRB- FWE-corrected p < 0.05 -RRB- .
24179788|No regions-of-interest showed significantly different metabolism in the HR group versus the LR group in the placebo condition , however compared with the LR group , the HR group displayed nominally increased glucose metabolism in the left amygdala during catecholamine depletion -LRB- SVC-corrected p = 0.05 -RRB- .
24179788|Compared with the LR group , the HR group displayed significantly increased glucose metabolism in the left ventral striatum , left amygdala , and left lateral orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- -LRB- FWE-corrected p < 0.05 -RRB- .
24184066|RESULTS : Increased GMD was found in the MBI compared to the UC group in the region of interest -LRB- ROI -RRB- analysis in the right amygdala , and bilaterally in the hippocampus .
24184115|In trials showing emotional expressions compared to neutral trials univariate analysis showed activation primarily in bilateral amygdala , fusiform gyrus , middle temporal gyrus/superior temporal sulcus and inferior occipital gyrus .
24184115|When employing either the left amygdala or the right amygdala as a seed region in RFX-GCM we found connectivity with the right hemispheric fusiform gyrus , with the indication that the fusiform gyrus sends information to the Amygdala .
24186078|RESULTS : Participants showed increased activity to backward-masked cannabis cues in regions supporting reward detection and interoception , including the left anterior insula , left ventral striatum/amygdala , and right ventral striatum .
24200213|Neurobiological models of anxiety have proposed important roles for amygdala-insula and amygdala-medial prefrontal cortex interactions in the generation and regulation of anxiety states , respectively .
24200213|No significant group differences in synchrony were observed between right amygdala and right ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- , between left amygdala and left vmPFC , or , after correction for multiple comparisons , right amygdala and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- dmPFC -RRB- .
24200213|However , significantly decreased positive synchrony was found between left basolateral amygdala and left anterior insula , in patients relative to controls .
24210457|In patients with lTLE , fear ratings were comparable to those of healthy subjects and were correlated with relatively stronger activations in the right compared to the left amygdala .
24210457|Patients with rTLE showed significantly reduced fear ratings compared to healthy subjects , and we did not find associations with amygdala lateralization .
24210457|This underlines the hypothesis that the right amygdala is biologically predisposed to processing fear , and its function can not be fully compensated in the event of right-sided mesiotemporal damage .
24212070|Pain intensity was positively correlated with volume in the left posterior hippocampus and left amygdala , and negatively correlated with the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex .
24219776|Automatic amygdala response to facial expression in schizophrenia : initial hyperresponsivity followed by hyporesponsivity .
24219776|BACKGROUND : It is well established that the amygdala is crucially involved in the processing of facial emotions .
24219776|In schizophrenia patients , a number of neuroimaging findings suggest hypoactivation of the amygdala in response to facial emotion , while others indicate normal or enhanced recruitment of this region .
24219776|There is evidence that schizophrenia patients display increased activation of the amygdala to neutral faces and that this is predominantly observed during early parts of the experiment .
24219776|Recent research examining the automatic processing of facial emotion has also reported amygdala hyperactivation in schizophrenia .
24219776|In the present study , we focused on the time-course of amygdala activation during the automatic processing of emotional facial expression .
24219776|We hypothesized that in comparison to healthy subjects , patients would initially show hyperresponsivity of the amygdala to masked emotional and neutral faces .
24219776|In addition , we expected amygdala deactivation in response to masked facial emotions from the first to the second phase to be more pronounced in patients than in controls .
24219776|Across all subjects , the bilateral amygdala response to faces -LRB- relative to the no facial expression condition -RRB- was larger in the initial phase -LRB- first half of trials -RRB- than in the second phase -LRB- second half of trials -RRB- .
24219776|During the initial phase , schizophrenia patients exhibited an increased right amygdala response to all faces and an increased left amygdala response to neutral faces compared with controls .
24219776|During the second phase , controls manifested a higher right amygdala response for all faces and a higher left amygdala response to angry faces than patients .
24219776|CONCLUSIONS : Schizophrenia patients are characterized by high initial amygdala responsivity to facial expressions at an automatic processing level , which substantially decreases with time .
24223175|Prefrontal control of the amygdala during real-time fMRI neurofeedback training of emotion regulation .
24223175|We observed in a previous study -LRB- PLoS ONE 6 : e24522 -RRB- that the self-regulation of amygdala activity via real-time fMRI neurofeedback -LRB- rtfMRI-nf -RRB- with positive emotion induction was associated , in healthy participants , with an enhancement in the functional connectivity between the left amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- and six regions of the prefrontal cortex .
24223175|Our exploratory analysis provides , for the first time , insights into the causal relationships within the network of regions engaged during the rtfMRI-nf procedure targeting the amygdala .
24223175|It suggests that the rACC may constitute a promising target for rtfMRI-nf training along with the amygdala in patients with affective disorders , particularly posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- .
24227659|RESULTS : T1? values showed significant decreases with age in cortical gray matter -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- , left and right caudate -LRB- P = 0.004 / 0.006 -RRB- , putamen -LRB- P = 0.001 , P < 0.001 -RRB- , hippocampus -LRB- P = 0.039 / 0.010 -RRB- , amygdala -LRB- P = 0.002 / 0.001 -RRB- , and nucleus accumbens -LRB- P = 0.001 / 0.002 -RRB- .
24239093|The multimodal analysis revealed relatives had decreased grey matter with hyper-activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus/amygdala , and decreased grey matter with hypo-activation in the thalamus .
24241476|Real-time neurofeedback using functional MRI could improve down-regulation of amygdala activity during emotional stimulation : a proof-of-concept study .
24241476|The amygdala is a central target of emotion regulation .
24241476|It is overactive and dysregulated in affective and anxiety disorders and amygdala activity normalizes with successful therapy of the symptoms .
24241476|The amygdala could therefore represent a promising target for real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- rtfMRI -RRB- neurofeedback .
24241476|However , in the case of the amygdala , down-regulation is supposedly more clinically relevant .
24241476|Therefore , we developed a task that trained participants to down-regulate activity of the right amygdala while being confronted with amygdala stimulation , i.e. negative emotional faces .
24241476|Over a period of four training sessions , participants significantly increased down-regulation of the right amygdala compared to a passive viewing condition to control for habilitation effects .
24252319|Analysis of signals generated by hPRL and S179D-PRL showed no activation of signal transducer and activation of transcription 5 -LRB- Stat5 -RRB- or other signaling molecules in the hippocampus , but activation of extracellular-regulated kinase -LRB- ERK -RRB- 1/2 in the amygdala .
2425289|These included : projections from the vertical , and , to a lesser extent , horizontal limb of the diagonal band coursing through the dorsal fornix , alveus and fimbria to the hippocampus ; fibers from the vertical and horizontal limbs of the diagonal band traveling anteriorly to the anterior olfactory nucleus , posterolaterally to the entorhinal cortex , and anterodorsally into the cingulum to the cingulate and retrosplenial , and , in some cases , the frontal and occipital cortices ; projections , mostly non-cholinergic , from the substantia innominata traveling laterally to the piriform cortex and amygdala , and anteriorly to the anterior olfactory nucleus and olfactory bulb ; and fibers from cells in the nucleus basalis coursing dorsally to the frontal and parietal cortices or laterally to the basolateral amygdala and piriform , insular and temporal cortices .
24258270|Relative to controls , patients failed to activate the right inferior frontal cortex during both conditions , and connectivity between amygdala and motor areas -LRB- supplementary motor area and cerebellum -RRB- was enhanced .
24258969|The voxel-wise approach showed pre-treatment hypoactivation in ventro-limbic regions -LRB- cluster including right hippocampus and left amygdala ; cluster size 528 ; p cluster < 0.004 -RRB- and facial perception involved in ventral-posterior regions -LRB- bilateral lingual gyrus , calcarine fissure and occipital superior gyrus , -LRB- k = 1,508 , p < 0.001 -RRB- and fronto-temporal regions .
24258969|The region of interest approach also confirmed hypoactivation in right and left amygdala -LRB- cluster corrected p = 0.035 and 0.043 , respectively -RRB- .
24258969|The regions of interest analysis showed an increase in amygdala activity during anger discrimination also in the group of patients .
24258969|The results suggest a state-dependent model depicting a flattened and aberrant response of amygdala to emotion discrimination that could explain the seemingly contradictory previous findings of hypo - and hyper-amygdala activation .
24266006|Compared to controls , KS patients had significantly decreased GMV bilaterally in insula , putamen , caudate , hippocampus , amygdala , temporal pole and frontal inferior orbita .
24269113|FreeSurfer software was used to estimate the volume of limbic-striatal regions -LRB- amygdala , hippocampus , caudate , putamen , pallidum , and nucleus accumbens -RRB- and the thickness of prefrontal regions -LRB- anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices -RRB- across both time points .
24269113|Higher frequency of positive maternal behavior during the interactions predicted attenuated volumetric growth in the right amygdala , and accelerated cortical thinning in the right anterior cingulate -LRB- males only -RRB- and left and right orbitofrontal cortices , between baseline and follow up .
24297883|Changes in salivary OT concentrations from baseline to 30 min postadministration were positively associated with increased activity in the right amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex during social vs. nonsocial judgments .
24312166|Our results highlight a role of the amygdala in neuroticism .
24312261|RESULTS : Compared to the NC group , the NA/CA group showed higher ADC values in the left inferior frontal gyrus and left amygdala , and a lower ADC value in the left postcentral gyrus .
24312261|CONCLUSIONS : Several microstructural changes were noted in the inferior frontal gyrus and amygdala in the NA/CA but not in the NA w/o CA group .
24318545|Inhibitory and multisynaptic spines , and hemispherical synaptic specialization in the posterodorsal medial amygdala of male and female rats .
24318545|The density of dendritic spines is sexually dimorphic and variable throughout the female estrous cycle in the rat posterodorsal medial amygdala -LRB- MePD -RRB- , a relevant area for the modulation of reproductive behavior in rats .
24324433|For the interaction of aging and sex , the most significant change was observed with regards to mean diffusivity , mostly in the right amygdala .
24329034|An overlap of their structural MR scans showed uniform sparing in the lateral portions of the language-dominant temporal lobe -LRB- superior and middle gyri -RRB- and atrophy in the medial temporal cortex -LRB- amygdala , limbic cortex -RRB- .
24332890|Conversely , paroxetine compared to placebo produced activation of right amygdala and bilateral insula and no effects in ACC when tested with EFPT .
24335762|RESULTS : Across the group , meal ingestion reduced food cue-evoked activity of amygdala , putamen , insula and thalamus , and increased activity in precuneus and bilateral parietal cortex .
24335762|Ageing was also positively associated with the difference in food cue-evoked activation between fed and fasted states in the right DLPFC , bilateral amygdala and striatum , and negatively associated with that of the left orbitofrontal cortex and VLPFC , superior frontal gyrus , left middle and temporal gyri , posterior cingulate and precuneus .
24343754|Relationship of trauma symptoms to amygdala-based functional brain changes in adolescents .
24343754|In this pilot study , amygdala connectivity related to trauma symptoms was explored using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- R-fMRI -RRB- in 23 healthy adolescents ages 13-17 years with no psychiatric diagnoses .
24343754|We examined the relationship of trauma symptoms to resting-state functional connectivity of the amygdala .
24343754|Increasing self-report of trauma symptoms by adolescents was associated with increasing functional connectivity with the right amygdala and a local limbic cluster and decreasing functional connectivity with the amygdala and a long-range frontoparietal cluster to the left amygdala , which can be a hallmark of immaturity .
24343754|These pilot findings in adolescents provide preliminary evidence that even mild trauma symptoms can be linked to the configuration of brain networks associated with the amygdala .
24345721|We performed a structural MRI study in 119 adult ADHD patients and 107 controls and investigated total gray and white matter and volumes of accumbens , caudate , globus pallidus , putamen , thalamus , amygdala and hippocampus .
24351212|Morphologic and volumetric analysis of amygdala , hippocampus , fornix and mamillary body with MRI in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy .
24351212|Our aim was to demonstrate lateralization morphometrically and volumetrically measuring the main limbic structures like hippocampus , amygdala , fornix and mamillary bodies in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy -LRB- TLE -RRB- and to establish the contribution of each anatomical structure to lateralizing the pathological site .
24351212|A high-resolution IR sequence was used for the volumetric analysis of amygdala and hippocampus and for the measurement of fornix and mamillary body thickness .
24351212|There was no difference in the volume of amygdala between the groups -LRB- p > 0.05 -RRB- .
24351212|Atrophy of the amygdala and thickness of mamillary bodies have the least importance for lateralization .
24359855|If some neurofunctional abnormalities seem to be independent of mood state , others were preferentially associated with mania or depression , involving the amygdala and other limbic regions as well as ventral frontal regions , with a likely hemispheric lateralization of these abnormalities according to the thymic state that was examined .
24360232|The gray matter volume of IPD patients decreased in the following order : the olfactory area to the right of the piriform cortex , the right amygdala , the left entorhinal cortex , and the left occipital lobe .
24361462|Gray-matter decrements attributable to IUGR comprised amygdala , basal ganglia , thalamus and insula bilaterally , left occipital and parietal lobes , and right perirolandic area .
24361663|Effects of MIR137 on fronto-amygdala functional connectivity .
24361663|Recently , a common genetic variant within MIR137 showed genome wide evidence of association with schizophrenia , and with altered amygdala activation in those at genetic risk for schizophrenia .
24361663|METHODS : By grouping 81 healthy participants as carrier or non-carriers of the MIR137 rs1625579 risk allele associated with schizophrenia , we investigated MIR137 's effects on altered cortical response during an fMRI face processing task and altered functional connectivity using the amygdala as a seed region .
24361663|RESULTS : Homozygous carriers of the risk allele were observed to show relatively increased functional connectivity between the right amygdala and frontal regions that play a key role in emotion processing and regulation -LRB- e.g. the cingulate and prefrontal cortex -RRB- .
24361663|CONCLUSIONS : Our findings provide the first evidence that the rs1625579 variant affects fronto-amygdala functional connectivity , providing further evidence that MIR137 may contribute to forms of psychosis in which affective symptoms are more prominent .
24367308|Differential activation of amygdala Arc expression by positive and negatively valenced emotional learning conditions .
24367308|Norepinephrine is released in the amygdala following negatively arousing learning conditions .
24367308|Recent evidence suggests that the valence of emotionally laden encounters may generate lateralized , as opposed to symmetric release of this transmitter in the right or left amygdala .
24367308|This question was addressed by determining if Arc expression is differentially distributed across the right and left amygdala following exposure to positively or negatively valenced learning conditions respectively .
24367308|Western blot analysis revealed that Arc expression in the right amygdala was elevated significantly above that observed in the left amygdala 60 and 90 min following fear conditioning .
24367308|Similarly , subjects exposed to a negatively valenced outcome consisting of an unexpected reduction in food rewards showed a greater level of Arc expression in only the right , but not left basolateral amygdala .
24367308|Presenting a positively valenced event involving an unexpected increase in food reward magnitude following bar pressing , resulted in significantly greater Arc expression in the left , but not right basolateral amygdala -LRB- p < 0.01 -RRB- .
24376401|An interaction of intranasal and oral drug was predicted in the amygdala .
24376401|The primary outcome was BOLD activity in the amygdala in response to angry faces .
24376401|RESULTS : In subjects randomized to oral placebo-intranasal vasopressin , there was a significantly diminished amygdala BOLD response from the baseline to post-drug scan compared with oral placebo-intranasal placebo subjects .
24376401|RM-ANOVA of the BOLD signal changes in the amygdala revealed a significant oral drug  intranasal drug  session interaction -LRB- F -LRB- 1 , 25 -RRB- = 4.353 , p < 0.05 -RRB- .
24376401|CONCLUSION : We found confirmatory evidence that SRX246 has effects on the amygdala that counter the effects of intranasal vasopressin .
24377682|The adaptation of emotional conflict , on the other hand , is suggested to be related to the rostral anterior cingulate inhibiting the processing of emotional distractors through a top-down modulation of amygdala responsivity .
24377682|Additional areas related to the conflict adaptation effect were the bilateral insula , the bilateral frontal operculum -LRB- fO -RRB- , the right amygdala , the left precentral and postcentral gyri , and the parietal cortex .
24380867|First , right amygdalar activity associated with emotional memory strength was enhanced by prior perceptual processing .
24380867|Second , prior perceptual processing of emotional pictures produced a stronger effect on recollection - than familiarity-related activations in the right amygdala and left hippocampus .
24380867|Finally , prior perceptual processing enhanced amygdalar connectivity with regions strongly associated with retrieval success , including hippocampal/parahippocampal regions , visual cortex , and ventral parietal cortex .
24381534|Reciprocal cooperation with humans but exploitation of computers by defection was associated with activation in the left amygdala .
24381534|Consequently , the intensity of emotion attached to human reciprocity was represented in the amygdala , whereas insight into the reciprocity of others was reflected in activation across the reward-related and ToM regions .
24382804|Comparing the effect of the different stimulation conditions , during anodal stimulation we found higher rCBF in the right mPFC , compared to the sham and in the right amygdala , superior PFC compared to the cathodal condition .
24384505|These results suggest that tDCS -LRB- right prefrontal -- anodal , left supraorbital -- cathodal -RRB- enhanced fear memories , possibly by influencing the prefrontal cortex-amygdala circuit underlying the memory for fear .
2439287|Mesial temporal lobe sites which demonstrated such a relationship included the amygdala , pes hippocampi , and parahippocampal gyrus .
24393393|RESULTS : Untreated patients demonstrated abnormal hyperactivation in the amygdala , fusiform gyrus , insula , anterior cingulate cortex , and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex .
24393393|Successful CBT was reflected in an overall downregulation in these fear circuitry structures , especially in the right amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex , with reductions in amygdala responsiveness associated with self-reported symptom improvement .
24393393|However , subliminal threat induced a pattern of right-lateralized hyperactivation in the amygdala and fusiform gyrus that was subject to intersession habituation across groups without showing significant sensitivity to CBT .
24393393|CONCLUSIONS : These results challenge prevailing models that emphasize a role for amygdala automaticity in the maintenance of anxiety .
24402653|Animal studies suggest a central role of the amygdala which modulates memory processes in hippocampus , prefrontal cortex and other brain areas .
24402653|Functional connectivity analyses revealed a stress-induced increase in coupling between the right amygdala and the right fusiform gyrus , when processing fearful as compared to neutral faces .
24402676|In addition , compared to controls , CI users displayed an activation focus in the right amygdala for congruent audiovisual stimuli .
24402676|Correlation analysis revealed that good speech performance was positively correlated with right amygdala activity for the congruent condition , but negatively correlated with bilateral visual cortices regardless of congruency .
24404185|Compared with the non-depressed patients , those with depressive symptoms exhibited significantly increased regional activity in the left middle frontal gyrus and right inferior frontal gyrus , and decreased ReHo in the left amygdala and bilateral lingual gyrus .
24443827|The ANCOVA revealed different patterns of regional GMV correlations in patients and controls , including of inter - and intra-insula , inter-amygdala and insula-postcentral gyrus connections .
24443827|CONCLUSIONS : Schizophrenia involves regional reductions in GMV and changes in GMV covariance in the insula , amygdala and postcentral gyrus .
24444320|The structural imaging studies reported various alterations in patients with schizophrenia and a history of homicidal behaviour , including : reduced inferior frontal and temporal cortices , increased mediodorsal white matter , and increased amygdala volumes .
24444320|Patients with a history of suicidal acts showed volumetric reductions in left orbitofrontal and superior temporal cortices , while right amygdala volume was increased , though , these findings have rarely been replicated .
24465436|METHODS : MDD patients -LRB- n = 95 -RRB- and age - and gender-matched controls -LRB- n = 34 -RRB- were assessed using probabilistic tractography of DTI to delineate three distinct brainstem tracts : the nigrostriatal tract -LRB- connecting brainstem to striatum -RRB- , solitary tract -LRB- connecting brainstem to amygdala -RRB- and corticospinal tract -LRB- connecting brainstem to precentral cortex -RRB- .
24465436|RESULTS : MDD participants were characterized by a significant and specific decrease in white matter integrity of the right solitary tract -LRB- p < 0.009 using independent t-test -RRB- , which is a `` bottom up '' afferent pathway that connects the brainstem to the amygdala .
24465436|CONCLUSIONS : The results provide new evidence to suggest that structural connectivity between the brainstem and the amygdala is altered in MDD .
24465436|These results are interesting in light of predominant theories regarding amygdala-mediated emotional reactivity observed in functional imaging studies of MDD .
24465436|The characterization of altered white matter integrity in the solitary tract in MDD supports the possibility of dysfunctional brainstem-amygdala connectivity impacting vulnerable circuits in MDD .
24475262|Our results revealed that reward processing in the right amygdala was modulated by the social context .
24475262|When playing on a team , increased activity in the amygdala during winning was a unique function of openness , while decreased activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum during losing was associated with extraversion and conscientiousness , respectively .
24475262|In conclusion , we provide evidence that working on a team influences the affective value of a negative outcome by attenuating the negative response associated with it in the amygdala .
24478669|Emotional information is typically better remembered than neutral content , and previous studies suggest that this effect is subserved particularly by the amygdala together with its interactions with the hippocampus .
24478669|However , it is not known whether amygdala damage affects emotional memory performance at immediate and delayed recall , and whether its involvement is modulated by stimulus valence .
24478669|We investigated these questions in a group of patients with Alzheimer 's disease -LRB- AD -RRB- , which affects the amygdala , hippocampus and neocortical regions .
24478669|In the brain-behavioral analyses , the left amygdala volume predicted the immediate recall of both positive and negative material , whereas at delay , left and right amygdala volumes were associated with performance with positive and negative words , respectively .
24492058|The hormones progesterone and estradiol modulate neural plasticity in the hippocampus , the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex .
24492058|Valence-specific modulations were found in the anterior cingulate , the amygdala and the posterior hippocampus .
24493846|The social network-network : size is predicted by brain structure and function in the amygdala and paralimbic regions .
24493846|Across the VBM and functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses , individual differences in SNS were consistently related to structural and functional differences in three regions : the left amygdala , right amygdala and the right entorhinal/ventral anterior temporal cortex .
24495461|Decreased CBF in the right amygdala and hippocampus correlated with ratings of the intensity of global subjective effects of MDMA .
24495461|The RSFC results complemented the CBF results , with decreases in RSFC between midline cortical regions , the medial prefrontal cortex , and MTL regions , and increases between the amygdala and hippocampus .
24497623|RESULTS : Results showed the right orbitofrontal cortex , bilateral thalamus , left anterior cingulate cortex , hippocampus and amygdala were significantly smaller in the BDD sample compared to controls .
24497992|Increased amygdala response to shame in remitted major depressive disorder .
24497992|The MDD group exhibited higher activation of the right amygdala and posterior insula for shame relative to guilt -LRB- SPM8 -RRB- .
24497992|Increased amygdala and posterior insula activations , known to be related to sensory perception of emotional stimuli , distinguish shame from guilt responses in remitted MDD .
24497992|Shame-induction may be a more sensitive probe of residual amygdala hypersensitivity in MDD compared with facial emotion-evoked responses previously found to normalize on remission .
24503371|Focus was on the examination of hippocampal and amygdalar volume differences .
24503371|FreeSurfer software detected significant group differences in the right and left hippocampus and in the right amygdala .
24503959|In contrast , passive tasks reliably engaged regions associated with visual and emotional information processing , including lingual gyrus and the amygdala .
24523911|Increased amygdalar and hippocampal volumes in young adults with social anxiety .
24523911|BACKGROUND : Functional neuroimaging studies have consistently shown abnormal limbic activation patterns in socially anxious individuals , but structural data on the amygdala and hippocampus of these patients are scarce .
24523911|This study explored the existence of structural differences in the whole brain , amygdala , and hippocampus of subjects with clinical and subthreshold social anxiety compared to healthy controls .
24523911|The amygdala and hippocampus were defined a priori as regions of interest and volumes were calculated by manual tracing .
24523911|RESULTS : The bilateral amygdala and left hippocampus were enlarged in socially anxious individuals relative to controls .
24523911|CONCLUSIONS : Our results show amygdalar and hippocampal volume alterations in social anxiety , possibly associated with symptom severity .
24523939|Real-time FMRI neurofeedback training of amygdala activity in patients with major depressive disorder .
24523939|We examined whether depressed participants can use rtfMRI-nf to enhance amygdala responses to positive autobiographical memories , and whether this ability alters symptom severity .
24523939|METHODS : Unmedicated MDD subjects were assigned to receive rtfMRI-nf from either left amygdala -LRB- LA ; experimental group , n = 14 -RRB- or the horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus -LRB- HIPS ; control group , n = 7 -RRB- and instructed to contemplate happy autobiographical memories -LRB- AMs -RRB- to raise the level of a bar representing the hemodynamic signal from the target region to a target level .
24523939|RESULTS : Participants in the experimental group upregulated their amygdala responses during positive AM recall .
24523939|CONCLUSIONS : Using rtfMRI-nf from the left amygdala during recall of positive AMs , depressed subjects were able to self-regulate their amygdala response , resulting in improved mood .
24526181|Trait impulsivity is related to ventral ACC and amygdala activity during primary reward anticipation .
24526181|Trait impulsivity was associated with increased activation during anticipation of primary reward in the anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- and amygdala .
24526181|Additionally , resting-state functional connectivity between the ACC and the right amygdala was negatively correlated with trait impulsivity .
24526181|These findings demonstrate that trait impulsivity is related not only to ACC-amygdala activation but also to how tightly coupled these regions are to one another .
24531049|Here , we examined resting-state fMRI connectivity across five face-selective regions in the right hemisphere that were identified with separate functional localizer scans : the PrC , amygdala -LRB- Amg -RRB- , superior temporal sulcus , fusiform face area -LRB- FFA -RRB- , and occipital face area .
24550791|This was reflected in the brain activation patterns , with the NH group employing the expected limbic and auditory regions including the left amygdala , left parahippocampus , right middle temporal gyrus and left superior temporal gyrus to a greater extent in processing affective stimuli when compared to the HL group .
24551159|Our results showed that extraversion was negatively correlated with GMV of the bilateral amygdala , the bilateral parahippocampal gyrus , the right middle temporal gyrus , and the left superior frontal gyrus , all of which are involved in emotional and social cognitive processes .
24577898|Involvement of central TRPV1 receptors in pentylenetetrazole and amygdala-induced kindling in male rats .
24577898|Therefore , we investigated the role of central TRPV1 receptors on the development of pentylenetetrazole -LRB- PTZ -RRB- and amygdala-induced kindling in rats .
24577898|In electrical kindling , stimulating and recording electrodes were implanted in the right amygdala of male rats .
24577898|Also , in amygdala kindling , S5D and ADD were significantly reduced following the administration of AMG-9810 .
24578695|Cortico-amygdala coupling as a marker of early relapse risk in cocaine-addicted individuals .
24578695|This study builds on efforts to identify neural markers of relapse risk by studying resting-state functional connectivity -LRB- rsFC -RRB- in neural circuits arising from the amygdala , a brain region implicated in relapse-related processes including craving and reactivity to stress following acute and protracted withdrawal from cocaine .
24578695|To approximate preclinical models of relapse-related circuitry , separate seeds were derived for the left and right basolateral -LRB- BLA -RRB- and corticomedial -LRB- CMA -RRB- amygdala .
24583336|Basal ?-opioid receptor availability in the amygdala predicts the inhibition of pain-related brain activity during heterotopic noxious counter-stimulation .
24583336|The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the magnitude of anti-nociceptive effects induced by heterotopic noxious counter-stimulation -LRB- HNCS -RRB- and the basal ?-opioid receptor availability in the amygdala .
24583336|This reduction was associated with higher basal ?-opioid receptor availability in the amygdala on the right -LRB- R -LRB- 2 -RRB- = 0.55 , p = 0.03 -RRB- with a similar trend on the left -LRB- R -LRB- 2 -RRB- = 0.24 , p = 0.22 -RRB- .
24583336|These results suggest that activation of ?-opioid receptors in the amygdala may contribute to the anti-nociceptive effects of HNCS .
24583336|The lack of RIII-reflex modulation further suggests that ?-opioid receptor activation in the amygdala contributes to decrease pain-related brain activity through a cerebral mechanism independent of descending modulation .
24586770|Subcortical volumes were measured using an automated technique -LRB- FreeSurfer -RRB- across structures including bilateral caudate , putamen , globus pallidus , thalamus , nucleus accumbens , hippocampus , amygdala , and five equal regions of the corpus callosum .
24589435|EA performance correlated with gray-matter reduction in the right amygdala , left insula , and posterior-superior temporal sulcus extending into the temporoparietal junction .
24593853|The right amygdalar tumor presenting with symptoms of separation anxiety disorder -LRB- SAD -RRB- : a case report .
24593853|A patient with an astrocytoma of the right-sided amygdala developed symptoms of separation anxiety disorders -LRB- SADs -RRB- .
24593853|The temporal relationship suggested that the amygdalar tumor could result in the specific symptoms .
24593853|To our knowledge , this is the first report of SAD as one manifestation of the amygdalar tumor .
24593853|The tumorigenesis of amygdala resulted in impaired regulation and abnormal activity associated with anticipating anxiety and conditioning .
24594508|RESULTS : Enhanced blood oxygenation functional imaging responses were found in the own versus unknown infant contrast in the bilateral precuneus , right superior temporal gyrus , right medial and left middle frontal gyri and left amygdala .
24594871|Modulation of resting-state amygdala-frontal functional connectivity by oxytocin in generalized social anxiety disorder .
24594871|Generalized social anxiety disorder -LRB- GSAD -RRB- is characterized by aberrant patterns of amygdala-frontal connectivity to social signals of threat and at rest .
24594871|Recent functional neuroimaging studies suggest that these effects are mediated through OXT 's effects on amygdala reactivity and/or amygdala-frontal connectivity .
24594871|The aim of the current study was to examine OXT 's effects on amygdala-frontal resting-state functional connectivity -LRB- rsFC -RRB- in GSAD patients and healthy controls -LRB- HCs -RRB- .
24594871|In individuals with GSAD , OXT enhanced rsFC of the left and right amygdala with rostral anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- / medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- , and in doing so , reversed -LRB- ie , ` normalized ' -RRB- the reduced amygdala-frontal connectivity observed relative to HCs evident on PBO .
24594871|Higher social anxiety severity in GSAD subjects correlated with lower amygdala-ACC/mPFC connectivity on PBO and higher social anxiety also correlated with greater enhancement in amygdala-frontal connectivity induced by OXT .
24602036|There was a significant interaction between ELS and group on blood-oxygen-level-dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- amplitude during anticipatory anxiety in the right amygdala and bilateral orbitofrontal cortex , posterior putamen and insula .
24607258|T1-weighted structural MRI scans were used to derive estimates of total intracranial volume , and hippocampal and amygdala gray matter volume using FreeSurfer .
24616684|The contrast nondirective meditation > concentrative practicing was characterized by higher activity in the right medial temporal lobe -LRB- parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala -RRB- .
24619953|RESULTS : We demonstrated significantly reduced connectivity between bilateral hippocampus , left inferior occipital , left lingual gyrus , bilateral calcarine sulcus , and right amygdala in the ALL group compared to controls .
24635708|Age-related reduced prefrontal-amygdala structural connectivity is associated with lower trait anxiety .
24635708|OBJECTIVE : A current neuroanatomical model of anxiety posits that greater structural connectivity between the amygdala and ventral prefrontal cortex -LRB- vPFC -RRB- facilitates regulatory control over the amygdala and helps reduce anxiety .
24635708|However , some neuroimaging studies have reported contradictory findings , demonstrating a positive rather than negative association between trait anxiety and amygdala-vPFC white matter integrity .
24635708|To help reconcile these findings , we tested the regulatory hypothesis of anxiety circuitry using aging as a model of white matter decline in the amygdala-vPFC pathway .
24635708|METHODS : We used probabilistic tractography to trace connections between the amygdala and vPFC in 21 younger , 18 middle-aged , and 15 healthy older adults .
24635708|The relationship between these amygdala-vPFC structural connectivity measures and age and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory -LRB- STAI -RRB- scores were assessed .
24635708|RESULTS : The tractography results revealed age-related decline in the FA -LRB- p = .005 -RRB- and radial diffusivity -LRB- p = .002 -RRB- of the amygdala-vPFC pathway .
24635708|Contrary to the regulatory hypothesis , we found a positive rather than negative association between trait anxiety and right amygdala-vPFC FA -LRB- p = .01 -RRB- .
24635708|CONCLUSION : These findings argue against the notion that greater amygdala-vPFC structural integrity facilitates better anxiety outcomes in healthy adults .
24636515|Thyroid peroxidase antibodies in the patient group correlated with increased grey matter density in right amygdala and enhanced connectivity between subcallosal and parahippocampal areas .
24636515|Treatment duration was associated with brain structure in frontal and occipital cortex and connectivity between left amygdala and frontal cortex .
24655655|The current study assesses CD-related differences in cortical thickness , surface area , and gyrification as well as volume differences in subcortical structures critical to neurodevelopmental models of CD -LRB- amygdala ; striatum -RRB- in a carefully characterized sample .
24655655|Structural MRI was collected and the FreeSurfer image analysis suite was used to provide measures of cortical thickness , surface area , and local gyrification as well as subcortical -LRB- amygdala and striatum -RRB- volumes .
24655655|However , youths with CD also showed reduced amygdala and striatum -LRB- putamen and pallidum -RRB- volumes .
24655655|CONCLUSIONS : Youths with CD show reduced cortical thickness within superior temporal regions , some indication of reduced gyrification within ventromedial frontal cortex and reduced amygdala and striatum -LRB- putamen and pallidum -RRB- volumes .
24661428|In general , latency variations of MLR correlated with resection longitude , while changes in amplitude correlated with the volume of the resection in the middle temporal pole and amygdala -LRB- Pearson ' correlation test , p < 0.05 -RRB- .
24666527|In patients with social anxiety disorder -LRB- SAD -RRB- it has been reported that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors -LRB- SSRIs -RRB- and placebo induce anxiolytic effects by attenuating neural activity in overlapping amygdala subregions , i.e. left basolateral and right ventrolateral amygdala .
24666527|However , it is not known whether these treatments inhibit amygdala subregions via similar or distinct brain pathways .
24666527|As anxiolytic treatments may alter amygdala-frontal couplings we investigated differences and similarities in amygdala-frontal functional co-activation patterns between responders and nonresponders to SSRIs and placebo in patients with SAD .
24666527|Functional couplings were evaluated with a seed region approach using voxel values from the left basolateral and right ventrolateral amygdala .
24666527|Responders and nonresponders to SSRIs and placebo showed different treatment-induced co-activations between the left amygdala and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- dlPFC -RRB- as well as the rostral anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- .
24666527|Conjunction analysis suggested shared anxiolysis-dependent inverse co-activations in SSRI and placebo responders between the left amygdala-dlPFC and left amygdala-rostral ACC , and a shared positive co-activation between left amygdala-dorsal ACC .
24666527|We demonstrate that amygdala-frontal co-activation patterns differentiate effective from ineffective anxiolytic treatments and that SSRI and placebo responders share overlapping neuromodulatory paths that may underlie improved emotion regulation and reduced expression of anxiety.TRIAL REGISTRATION : clinicaltrials.gov Identifier : NCT00343707 .
24672451|A second analysis revealed that different anatomical GM regions , known to be associated with the hippocampus , such as the parahippocampal cortex , amygdala , medial , and orbital prefrontal cortices , covaried with the hippocampus in the control group .
24690370|When participants were administered escitalopram relative to placebo , left amygdala activity was increased and right inferior frontal gyrus -LRB- IFG -RRB- activity was decreased during presentation of positive pictures -LRB- potentiation of positive emotion processing -RRB- .
24690370|In contrast , escitalopram was associated with decreased left amygdala and increased right IFG activity during presentation of negative pictures -LRB- attenuation of negative emotion processing -RRB- .
24700583|CT-targeted touch activates `` social brain '' regions including insula , right posterior superior temporal sulcus , amygdala , temporal poles , and orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- McGlone et al. 2012 -RRB- .
24700583|These included amygdala and temporal pole .
24721821|We assessed amygdalar morphology and volume in 18 LOAD and 18 EOAD patients and 36 aged-matched controls and explored their relationship with the hippocampal volume .
24721821|Three-dimensional amygdalar shape was reconstructed with the radial atrophy mapping technique , hippocampal volume was measured using a manual method .
24721821|Atrophy was greater in LOAD than EOAD : 25 % versus 17 % in the amygdala and 20 % versus 13 % in the hippocampus .
24721821|In the amygdala , LOAD showed significantly greater tissue loss than EOAD in the right dorsal central , lateral , and basolateral nuclei -LRB- 20 % -30 % loss , p < 0.03 -RRB- , all known to be connected to limbic regions .
24721821|In LOAD but not EOAD , greater hippocampal atrophy was associated with amygdalar atrophy in the left dorsal central and medial nuclei -LRB- r = 0.6 , p < 0.05 -RRB- also part of the limbic system .
24734987|Left insula extending to basal ganglia and frontotemporal gyri as well as bilateral thalamus and amygdala showed consistent activation across the two paradigms .
24736182|Sensitive periods of amygdala development : the role of maltreatment in preadolescence .
24736182|The amygdala is vulnerable to stress-dependent disruptions in neural development .
24736182|Animal models have shown that stress increases dendritic arborization leading to larger amygdala volumes .
24736182|Human studies of early stress and amygdala volume , however , remain inconclusive .
24736182|This study compared amygdala volume in adults with childhood maltreatment to that in healthy controls .
24736182|Random forest regression with conditional trees was used to assess relative importance of exposure to adversity at each age on amygdala , thalamic or caudate volume .
24736182|Severity of exposure to adversity across age accounted for 27 % of the variance in right amygdala volume .
24736182|Subjects in the highest exposure quartile -LRB- MACE-11 , range = 11-54 -RRB- had a 9.1 % greater right amygdala volume than subjects in the lowest exposure quartile -LRB- MACE-11 , ? 3.5 -RRB- .
24736182|No associations emerged between age of exposure and volume of the left amygdala or bilateral caudate or thalamus .
24736182|Severity of adversity experienced at age 10-11 contributed to larger right but not left amygdala volume in adulthood .
24736182|Results provide preliminary evidence that the amygdala may have a developmental sensitive period in preadolescence .
24738077|Our results demonstrated abnormal gamma activity within 100 ms in the emotion-related regions -LRB- amygdala , orbitofrontal -LRB- OFC -RRB- cortex , anterior insula -LRB- AI -RRB- , and superior temporal pole -RRB- in the MDD patients , suggesting that these patients may have dysfunctions or negativity biases in perceptual binding of emotional features at very early stage .
24740310|Diffusion kurtosis imaging and high-resolution MRI demonstrate structural aberrations of caudate putamen and amygdala after chronic mild stress .
24740310|More recently , other brain regions , such as the caudate nucleus , the putamen and the amygdala have also been suggested to play a role in the development of mood disorders .
24740310|In this study we evaluated diffusion properties in the prefrontal cortex , caudate putamen -LRB- CPu -RRB- and amygdala of anhedonic-like and resilient phenotypes and found that mean kurtosis in the CPu was significantly different between the anhedonic-like and resilient animals .
24740310|In addition , axial diffusion and radial diffusion were increased in the stressed animal groups in the CPu and the amygdala , respectively .
24740310|These findings confirm the involvement of the CPu and the amygdala in stress related disorders and MDD .
24741043|Cannabis use is quantitatively associated with nucleus accumbens and amygdala abnormalities in young adult recreational users .
24741043|Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States , but little is known about its effects on the human brain , particularly on reward/aversion regions implicated in addiction , such as the nucleus accumbens and amygdala .
24741043|Gray matter density analyses revealed greater gray matter density in marijuana users than in control participants in the left nucleus accumbens extending to subcallosal cortex , hypothalamus , sublenticular extended amygdala , and left amygdala , even after controlling for age , sex , alcohol use , and cigarette smoking .
24741043|Significant shape differences were detected in the left nucleus accumbens and right amygdala .
24745028|Volumetric analysis of amygdala , hippocampus , and prefrontal cortex in therapy-naive PTSD participants .
24745028|OBJECTIVE : In our study we have hypothesized that volume changes of amygdala , hippocampus , and prefrontal cortex are more pronounced in male posttraumatic stress disorder participants .
24745028|RESULTS : We found that left amygdala is the most significant parameter for distinction between PTSD participants and participants without PTSD .
24745028|Roc curve method outlined left amygdala AUC = 0.898 -LRB- 95 % CI = 0.830-0 .967 -RRB- and right amygdala AUC = 0.882 -LRB- 95 % CI = 0.810-0 .954 -RRB- in the group of PTSD participants which makes both variables highly statistically significant .
24745028|CONCLUSION : The present investigation revealed significant volume decrease of left amygdala in PTSD patients .
24745028|Concerning important functions of the amygdala and her neuroanatomical connections with other brain structures , we need to increase number of participants to clarify the correlation between impared amygdala and possible other different brain structures in participants with PTSD .
24747685|Additionally , amygdala is involved in processing and modulation of pain .
24747685|While the amygdala , particularly its central nucleus -LRB- CeA -RRB- , has been shown to contribute to pain control , the descending pain regulation by the CeA is still only partly characterized .
24747685|The aim was to assess whether the descending pain regulatory effect by glutamate in the amygdala varies with the submodality or the body side of nociceptive testing , brain hemisphere or the amygdaloid glutamate receptor .
24748087|The superior temporal sulcus , amygdala , and medial frontal cortex play important roles in facial-expression recognition .
24753197|Differential effects of early life stress on hippocampus and amygdala volume as a function of emotional abilities .
24753197|Previous studies in clinical populations have shown that hippocampus and amygdala , two central structures of limbic emotion processing circuits , are predominantly affected by early stress exposure .
24753197|We , therefore , investigated the volume of hippocampus and amygdala in 25 high alexithymic -LRB- h-ALEX -RRB- and 25 low alexithymic -LRB- l-ALEX -RRB- individuals , which were matched with regard to ELS , but significantly differed in their degree of emotional functioning .
24753197|Furthermore , ELS was positively associated with left amygdala volume in l-ALEX individuals , but not in individuals with high levels of alexithymia .
24753242|Analyses examined moderation by anxiety/depression of condition-dependent coupling between regions of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- dlPFC -RRB- previously associated with approach and avoidance motivation and amygdala/orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- .
24753242|RESULTS : Anxious arousal was positively associated with amygdala ? right dlPFC coupling .
24756342|Role of FKBP5 in emotion processing : results on amygdala activity , connectivity and volume .
24756342|Based on recent findings of altered amygdala activity following childhood adversity , the present study aimed at clarifying the impact of genetic variation in FKBP5 on threat-related neural activity and coupling as well as morphometric alterations in stress-sensitive brain systems .
24756342|There was a main effect of FKBP5 on the left amygdala , with T homozygotes showing the highest activity , largest volume and increased coupling with the left hippocampus and the orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- .
24756342|Moreover , amygdala-OFC coupling proved to be associated with depression in this genotype .
24756342|In addition , our results support previous evidence of a gene-environment interaction on right amygdala activity with respect to retrospective assessment of childhood adversity , but clarify that this does not generalize to the prospective assessment .
24760033|Left and right amygdala - mediofrontal cortical functional connectivity is differentially modulated by harm avoidance .
24760033|BACKGROUND : The left and right amygdalae are key regions distinctly involved in emotion-regulation processes .
24760033|The lateralized amygdala affective processing linked with the temperament dimension Harm Avoidance -LRB- HA -RRB- remains poorly understood .
24760033|METHODS : In 56 drug-naive healthy female subjects , we have examined the relationship between the personality dimension HA on lateralized amygdala rsFC .
24760033|RESULTS : Across all subjects , left and right amygdalae were connected with distinct regions mainly within the ipsilateral hemisphere .
24760033|Females scoring higher on HA displayed stronger left amygdala rsFC with ventromedial prefrontal cortical -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- regions involved in affective disturbances .
24760033|In high HA scorers , we also observed stronger right amygdala rsFC with the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- dmPFC -RRB- , which is implicated in negative affect regulation .
24760033|CONCLUSIONS : In healthy females , left and right amygdalae seem implicated in distinct mPFC brain networks related to HA and may represent a vulnerability marker for sensitivity to stress and anxiety -LRB- disorders -RRB- .
24769166|A region-of-interest analysis detected increased activation for NH controls in the right amygdala when responding to affective stimuli , but failed to find a similar heightened response in the TIN and HL groups .
24769166|Our results suggest that the emotional processing network is altered in tinnitus to rely on the parahippocampus and insula , rather than the amygdala , and this alteration may maintain a select advantage for the rapid processing of affective stimuli despite the hearing loss .
24781447|RESULTS : Relative to comparison subjects , individuals exposed to childhood maltreatment exhibited significantly smaller gray matter volumes in the right orbitofrontal/superior temporal gyrus extending to the amygdala , insula , and parahippocampal and middle temporal gyri and in the left inferior frontal and postcentral gyri .
24793794|However , we did not replicate the activation in the amygdala and the cingulate and prefrontal cortex found in some studies .
24794883|Hippocampus and amygdala volumes in children and young adults at high-risk of schizophrenia : research synthesis .
24794883|BACKGROUND : Studies have reported hippocampal and amygdala volume abnormalities in schizophrenic patients .
24794883|METHODS : We performed a review of 29 magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- studies measuring hippocampal and amygdala volumes in subjects at HR for schizophrenia .
24794883|Abnormal amygdala volumes were found in FE subjects , in children with combined risk symptoms/factors and in older subjects using different inclusion criteria , but not in young adults .
24794883|CONCLUSION : Hippocampal and amygdala abnormalities may be present before schizophrenia onset .
24795154|Compared to age - and sex-matched healthy controls -LRB- n = 9 -RRB- , cocaine dependent subjects showed significantly lower BPND values in the ventral -LRB- bilateral : -28.2 % , p = 0.011 -RRB- , associative -LRB- right : -21.4 % , p = 0.043 -RRB- , and sensorimotor striatum -LRB- bilateral : -21.7 % , p = 0.045 -RRB- , amygdala -LRB- left : -26 % , p = 0.046 -RRB- and insula -LRB- right : -23.3 % , p = 0.041 -RRB- .
24795154|The longer the duration of abstinence , the lower the BPND values in the sensorimotor striatum -LRB- r = -0.71 , p = 0.034 -RRB- , left amygdala -LRB- r = -0.73 , p = 0.026 -RRB- and right insula -LRB- r = -0.67 , p = 0.046 -RRB- .
24795154|Compared to healthy controls , BPND values were significantly reduced in those who tested negative for cocaine on the PET test session in the ventral -LRB- p = 0.018 -RRB- and sensorimotor striatum -LRB- p = 0.017 -RRB- , left amygdala -LRB- p = 0.008 -RRB- , and right insula -LRB- p = 0.029 -RRB- , but not in those who tested positive .
24796655|The existing literature on the role of emotion regulation circuits -LRB- amygdala-prefrontal cortex -RRB- in the adolescent brain yields mixed results , particularly on the role of these regions in the context of reward sensitivity and risk-taking behavior sensitivity and risk-taking behavior .
24796655|Separate seed-based correlations with bilateral amygdala and bilateral nucleus accumbens used as the seed were performed to determine functional connectivity using functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- .
24796655|The results showed greater connectivity between the amygdala -LRB- seed region -RRB- and the right middle frontal gyrus , left cingulate gyrus , left precuneus and right inferior parietal lobule in RT adolescents than in NRT adolescents .
24797333|We found that individuals who were more mindful of the present had greater GM volume in the right hippocampus/amygdala and bilateral ACC , but less GM volume in bilateral PCC and the left orbitofrontal cortex .
24800784|A functional variant in the neuropeptide S receptor 1 gene moderates the influence of urban upbringing on stress processing in the amygdala .
24800784|We have previously shown that urban upbringing and city living were associated with stress-induced activity in the amygdala and the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- pACC -RRB- .
24800784|While no main effect of rs324981 on amygdala and pACC activity was detected , we found a distinct interaction between rs324981 and urban upbringing modulating right amygdala responses .
24800784|Moreover , right amygdala responses were significantly higher in subjects who also showed a salivary cortisol response to the stress exposure .
24800897|We predicted that OXY would decrease amygdala activity to negative stimuli and increase ventral striatum -LRB- VS -RRB- activity to positive stimuli .
24802625|Outcome measures were parent ratings of attention and inhibitory control , thickness and surface area of the orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- lateral -LRB- LOFC -RRB- and medial -LRB- MOFC -RRB- -RRB- and right inferior frontal gyrus -LRB- rIFG -RRB- , and volumetric measures of the striatum and amygdala .
24802969|Five regions of interest -LRB- ROIs -RRB- per hemisphere were created in native space : thalamus , amygdala , entorhinal cortex , hippocampus , and parahippocampus .
24813437|Social phobia -LRB- SP -RRB- has been associated with amygdala hyperreactivity to fear-relevant stimuli .
24813437|Individuals with SP as a whole exhibited a reversal of the pattern observed in healthy controls in that they showed upregulation of amygdala activity during affect labeling .
24813437|Although none of the SP subgroups showed the normative pattern of amygdala downregulation , it was those with comorbid depression specifically who showed significant upregulation .
24813437|Effects could not be attributed to differences in task performance , amygdala reactivity or right ventral lateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- RVLPFC -RRB- engagement , but may stem from dysfunctional communication between amygdala and RVLPFC .
24815323|METHODS : Based on a collaborative dataset from South Korea -LRB- inhalant users : N = 15 , mean age = 16.7 , SD = 1.1 ; controls : N = 15 , mean age = 15.4 , SD = 1.2 -RRB- and Australia -LRB- inhalant users : N = 7 , mean age = 18.2 , SD = 1.4 ; controls : N = 7 , mean age = 18.9 , SD = 2.6 -RRB- , the volumes of caudate nucleus , putamen , pallidum , amygdala , hippocampus , and thalamus were estimated in adolescent inhalant users and healthy adolescents using FreeSurfer .
24817178|Effect of prior exercise training and myocardial infarction-induced heart failure on the neuronal and glial densities and the GFAP-immunoreactivity in the posterodorsal medial amygdala of rats .
24817178|Exercise training has neuroprotective effects whereas myocardial infarction -LRB- MI -RRB- and heart failure -LRB- HF -RRB- can cause neuronal death and reactive gliosis in the whole amygdala .
24817178|The posterodorsal medial amygdala -LRB- MePD -RRB- is involved with cardiovascular reflexes and the central control of sympathetic/parasympathetic responses .
24818082|Relative to controls , children with DCD and/or ADHD exhibited similar reductions in functional connectivity between the primary motor cortex and the bilateral inferior frontal gyri , right supramarginal gyrus , angular gyri , insular cortices , amygdala , putamen , and pallidum .
24824165|Whereas the implications of some brain regions -LRB- e.g. amygdala -RRB- have been extensively examined , the implication of the precuneus remains yet to be determined .
24828372|The three networks were investigated using a seed-based ROI approach with seeds in the bilateral amygdala -LRB- limbic network -RRB- , bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- dACC ; salience network -RRB- and bilateral posterior cingulate cortex -LRB- default mode network -RRB- .
24828372|RESULTS : Compared to healthy controls , clinically depressed adolescents showed increased RSFC of the left amygdala with right parietal cortical areas , and decreased right amygdala RSFC with left frontal cortical areas including the ACC , as well as with right occipito-parietal areas .
24828372|CONCLUSIONS : The aberrant RSFC of the amygdala network and the dACC network may be related to altered emotion processing and regulation in depressed adolescents .
24835267|In contrast , females demonstrated a stronger positive relation between emotion regulation ability and rGMV in an anatomical cluster that extends from the left brainstem to the left hippocampus , the left amygdala and the insular cortex .
24839886|Lifetime CD symptoms were negatively correlated with amygdala , superior temporal cortex , fusiform gyrus , and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity for the contrast `` all-faces versus fixation . ''
24841112|On the other hand , neural activation of the left and right superior temporal gyrus , left middle and inferior temporal gyrus , right and left posterior cingulate gyrus , right amygdala , left and right fusiform gyrus was more prominent in patients with DD in comparison with the control group .
24841618|Neuroimaging studies have indicated that people with alexithymia show structural and functional alterations in brain areas associated with emotional awareness , as amygdala , insula , anterior cingulate cortex , fusiform gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus , and only occasionally alterations in the cerebellar activity were reported .
24841618|As a corollary aim , the associations between volumes of amygdala , insula , anterior cingulate cortex , fusiform gyrus or parahippocampal gyrus and alexithymia scores have been investigated .
24841618|Volumes of right amygdala , left insula and left parahippocampal gyrus were negatively associated with the alexithymia scores .
24850532|Methamphetamine-dependent participants also exhibited greater resting-state functional connectivity of the midbrain with the putamen , amygdala , and hippocampus -LRB- P < .05 , whole brain , cluster corrected -RRB- .
24862077|Using psychophysiological interaction -LRB- PPI -RRB- analysis , we investigated sex-based differences in functional connectivity with a key emotion-processing region -LRB- amygdala , AMG -RRB- and a key reward-processing area -LRB- ventral striatum , VS -RRB- in response to high vs. low energy-dense -LRB- ED -RRB- food images using blood oxygen level-dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- in obese persons in fasted and fed states .
24862297|Early life stress modulates amygdala-prefrontal functional connectivity : implications for oxytocin effects .
24862297|Recent evidence suggests that early life stress -LRB- ELS -RRB- changes stress reactivity via reduced resting state functional connectivity -LRB- rs-FC -RRB- between amygdala and the prefrontal cortex .
24862297|Oxytocin -LRB- OXT -RRB- modulates amygdala connectivity and attenuates responses to psychosocial stress , but its effect appears to be moderated by ELS .
24862297|Here we first investigate the effect of ELS on amygdala-prefrontal rs-FC , and examine whether ELS-associated changes of rs-FC in this neural circuit predict its response to psychosocial stress .
24862297|Secondly , we explore the joint effect of OXT and ELS on the amygdala-prefrontal circuit .
24862297|We measured the rs-FC to bilateral amygdalae and subsequently assessed changes of state anxiety and prefrontal responses to psychosocial stress .
24862297|Multiple linear regressions showed that ELS , specifically emotional abuse , predicted reduced rs-FC between the right amygdala and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- pgACC -RRB- , which in turn predicted elevated state anxiety after psychosocial stress .
24862297|In subjects with lower ELS scores , stronger pgACC-amygdala rs-FC predicted stronger pgACC deactivation during the psychosocial stress task , and this rest-task interaction was attenuated by OXT .
24862297|These findings highlight that ELS reduces pgACC-amygdala rs-FC and alters how rs-FC of this circuit predicts its stress responsiveness .
24862297|Such changes in pgACC-amygdala functional dynamics may underlie the altered sensitivity to the effects of OXT after ELS .
24862390|In particular , studies consistently cite elevated ghrelin and abnormal activation patterns in homeostatic -LRB- hypothalamus -RRB- and hedonic -LRB- striatum , amygdala , insula -RRB- regions governing appetite .
24862390|Healthy-weight control women exhibited significant positive associations between fasting acylated ghrelin and activity in the right amygdala , hippocampus , insula , and orbitofrontal cortex in response to high-calorie foods , associations which were absent in the AN and AN-WR groups .
24862391|In the EL-Trauma + group , both the right amygdala and the left hippocampus were positively associated with PTSD severity .
24865440|Compared with the structural covariance patterns of the HCs , the FD-related differences were mainly located in the amygdala , hippocampus/parahippocampus -LRB- HIPP/paraHIPP -RRB- , thalamus , lingual gyrus , and cerebellum .
24869925|Both task-dependent and task-independent analyses indicated significant functional connectivity of this region with the temporo-occipital and lateral occipital cortex , the inferior frontal and parietal cortices , the thalamus and the amygdala .
24874919|5-HTTLPR/rs25531 polymorphism and neuroticism are linked by resting state functional connectivity of amygdala and fusiform gyrus .
24874919|On a neural level , this bias can be characterized by altered amygdala and fusiform gyrus -LRB- FFG -RRB- activity during perception of negative facial expressions .
24874919|Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in a multi-center-sample of 178 healthy subjects of European descent , this study investigated the association of 5-HTTLPR -LRB- short s - and long l-allele -RRB- including the genotype of the single nucleotide polymorphism -LRB- SNP -RRB- rs25531 -LRB- A/G -RRB- within this region polymorphism , and trait neuroticism on resting-state functional connectivity -LRB- rs-FC -RRB- between amygdala and the FFG .
24874919|Moreover , we aimed to identify additional brain regions with associations of 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 -LRB- combined according to its expression ; low : s/s ; high : l -LRB- A -RRB- / l -LRB- A -RRB- ; intermediate : s/l -LRB- A -RRB- , s/l -LRB- G -RRB- , l -LRB- G -RRB- / l -LRB- G -RRB- , l -LRB- A -RRB- / l -LRB- G -RRB- -RRB- and trait neuroticism to amygdala rs-FC .
24874919|Separate analyses for 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 and neuroticism -LRB- controlling for age , gender , handedness , and research site -RRB- revealed that s/s-homozygotes and individuals high in neuroticism obtained altered amygdala rs-FC in the right occipital face area , which is considered to be a `` core component '' of the face processing system .
24874919|Additionally , associations of 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 genotype and amygdala rs-FC were observed in the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex , whereas neuroticism was not related to rs-FC in these areas .
24874919|The presented data implies that 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 variants and neuroticism are linked by resting state functional connectivity of amygdala and fusiform gyrus and suggests that variants of 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 genotype and different levels of neuroticism may partly account for altered processing of negative facial emotions .
24882198|Additional region of interest -LRB- ROI -RRB- analysis focused on mPFC-amygdala functional connectivity as well as correlations between the clinical features in euthymic BP was also conducted .
24882198|In addition , euthymic BP showed greater connectivity between mPFC and right amygdala compared to HS , which was also correlated with the duration of the disease .
24882198|CONCLUSIONS : Compared to HS , the euthymic BP showed abnormal decoupling -LRB- decreased functional connectivity -RRB- activity between mPFC-dlPFC and hyperconnectivity -LRB- increased functional connectivity -RRB- and between mPFC and amygdala .
24882566|The prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- is thought to implement controls that minimize performance disruptions from threat-induced anxiety and goal distraction by modulating activity in regions involved in threat detection , such as the amygdala .
24882566|We developed a paradigm to determine if threat-induced anxiety would enhance functional connectivity between the amygdala and IFG , OFC , and vmPFC .
24882566|Task-specific changes in functional connectivity with the amygdala were examined using psychophysiological interaction analysis .
24882566|Greater functional connectivity between the right amygdala and bilateral IFG , OFC , vmPFC , anterior cingulate cortex , and frontopolar cortex was associated with threat exposure .
24882566|CONCLUSIONS : Exposure to unpredictable threat modulates amygdala-PFC functional connectivity that may help maintain performance when experiencing anxiety induced by threat .
24882567|BACKGROUND : The amygdala is a key structure in serotonergic emotion-processing circuits .
24882567|However , it is little-known whether psilocybin reduces amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli and whether any change in amygdala reactivity is related to mood change .
24882567|METHODS : This study assessed the effects of acute administration of the hallucinogen psilocybin -LRB- .16 mg/kg -RRB- versus placebo on amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli in 25 healthy volunteers using blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging .
24882567|The psilocybin-induced attenuation of right amygdala reactivity in response to negative stimuli was related to the psilocybin-induced increase in positive mood state .
24882567|CONCLUSIONS : These results demonstrate that acute treatment with psilocybin decreased amygdala reactivity during emotion processing and that this was associated with an increase of positive mood in healthy volunteers .
24882567|These findings may be relevant to the normalization of amygdala hyperactivity and negative mood states in patients with major depression .
24882678|Significant main effects of group showed greater blood oxygenation level-dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- response for NSSI than controls in right midbrain/pons ; culmen ; amygdala ; and parahippocampal , inferior frontal and superior temporal gyri ; as well as orbital frontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- .
24884791|Does the amygdala response correlate with the personality trait ` harm avoidance ' while evaluating emotional stimuli explicitly ?
24884791|Emotional stimuli are processed by a neural network that include the left and right amygdalae as important key nodes .
24884791|Explicit , implicit and passive processing of affective stimuli are known to activate the amygdalae differently reflecting differences in attention , level of detailed analysis of the stimuli and the cognitive control needed to perform the required task .
24884791|Previous studies revealed that implicit processing or passive viewing of affective stimuli , induce a left amygdala response that correlates with HA .
24884791|RESULTS : Both analyses revealed increased neural activity in the left laterobasal -LRB- LB -RRB- amygdala of the high HA participants while they were rating the positive and the negative stimuli .
24884791|CONCLUSIONS : Our results indicate that the left amygdala response to explicit processing of affective stimuli does correlate with HA .
24885823|Volumetric data , values of mean diffusivity -LRB- MD -RRB- and fractional anisotropy -LRB- FA -RRB- for seven subcortical GM structures -LRB- hippocampus , caudate nucleus , putamen , globus pallidus , nucleus accumbens , thalamus and amygdala -RRB- were obtained using a model-based segmentation and registration tool .
24885823|In the patient-control group comparison of VBM , the right putamen , bilateral nucleus accumbens and right caudate nucleus of epileptic patients exhibited a significantly decreased density Segregated volumetry and diffusion assessment of subcortical GM showed apparent atrophy of the left caudate nucleus , left amygdala and right putamen ; reduced FA values for the bilateral nucleus accumbens ; and elevated MD values for the left thalamus , right hippocampus and right globus pallidus A decreased volume of the nucleus accumbens consistently related to an early onset of disease .
24886495|RESULTS : The brain areas that were activated in the sham-point group relative to the model group were primarily centred on the bilateral limbic system , the right frontal lobe , and the striatum , whereas the activated areas in the ST36 group were primarily centred on the bilateral limbic system -LRB- pyriform cortex -RRB- , the bilateral temporal lobe -LRB- olfactory cortex -RRB- , the right amygdala and the right hippocampus .
24886495|Compared with the sham-point group , the ST36 group showed greater activation in the bilateral amygdalae and the left temporal lobe .
24892191|The hypothesis being tested was formulated before the data collection -LRB- neural correlates of SP would include the amygdala , insula , anterior cingulate gyrus and others -RRB- .
24893734|Visual threat-related signals are not only processed via a cortical geniculo-striatal pathway to the amygdala but also via a subcortical colliculo-pulvinar-amygdala pathway , which presumably mediates implicit processing of fearful stimuli .
24898851|Simultaneously , fMRI results indicated higher activation in anxiety-sensitive participants than in controls during interoception in a network of cortical and subcortical brain regions -LRB- thalamus , amygdala , parahippocampus -RRB- that overlaps with known fear circuitry structures .
24898851|In particular , the activity of the right amygdala was up-regulated .
24898851|Future prospective-longitudinal studies are needed to validate the role of the amygdala for transition to disorder .
24904065|The right posterior orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- and left amygdala were activated in the -LSB- Neg > Neu -RSB- contrast , whereas the left posterior OFC was activated in the -LSB- Pos > Neu -RSB- contrast .
24904065|Negative urgency was related to the right lateral OFC -LRB- r = 0.43 , P = 0.03 -RRB- and the left amygdala -LRB- r = 0.39 , P = 0.04 -RRB- -LSB- Neg > Neu -RSB- activation .
24904065|Negative urgency also mediated the relationship between -LSB- Neg > Neu -RSB- activation and general risk-taking -LRB- regression weights = 3.42 for right OFC and 2.75 for the left amygdala -RRB- .
24904065|Emotional cue-induced activation in right lateral OFC and left amygdala might relate to emotion-based risk-taking through negative urgency .
24908158|Two patients -LRB- 29 % -RRB- also had contralateral hippocampus responses with a mean latency of 7.5 ms -LRB- range 5-12 ms -RRB- and without involvement of the contralateral temporal neocortex or amygdala .
24912179|OXT increased -LSB- -LRB- 18 -RRB- F -RSB- MPPF nondisplaceable binding potential -LRB- BPND -RRB- in the dorsal raphe nucleus -LRB- DRN -RRB- , the core area of 5-HT synthesis , and in the amygdala/hippocampal complex , insula , and orbitofrontal cortex .
24912179|Importantly , the amygdala appears central in the regulation of 5-HT by OXT : -LSB- -LRB- 18 -RRB- F -RSB- MPPF BPND changes in the DRN correlated with changes in right amygdala , which were in turn correlated with changes in hippocampus , insula , subgenual , and orbitofrontal cortex , a circuit implicated in the control of stress , mood , and social behaviors .
24912179|OXT administration is known to inhibit amygdala activity and results in a decrease of anxiety , whereas high amygdala activity and 5-HT dysregulation have been associated with increased anxiety .
24917798|The memory-enhancing effect of emotion has been linked to the engagement of emotion - and memory-related medial temporal lobe -LRB- MTL -RRB- regions -LRB- amygdala-AMY ; hippocampus-HC ; parahippocampus-PHC -RRB- , during both encoding and retrieval .
24918067|Further , valence-dependent activation for response execution was seen in the amygdala , ventral striatum , subgenual cingulate cortex , and orbitofrontal cortex in comparison subjects but not in probands .
24920615|We found that bilateral voice-sensitive auditory regions as well as right amygdala coded the physical difference between consecutive stimuli .
24926249|The goal of this study was to use neuroimaging to test what the unique contribution is of depression and anxiety symptomatology on emotional processing and amygdala activation , and to compare the results with a healthy control group .
24926249|We were particularly interested in the relation between depression/anxiety symptomatology and patterns of amygdala activation .
24926249|However , we found that dimensional scores on an anxiety but not a depression subscale significantly predicted brain activation in the right amygdala when processing fearful , happy and neutral faces .
24926249|These results suggest that anxiety symptoms are a better predictor for differentiating activation patterns in the amygdala than depression symptoms .
24926249|To conclude , this study shows that abnormal amygdala responses to emotional faces in depression and anxiety seems to be more dependent on anxiety symptoms than on depression symptoms , and thereby highlights the need for more research to better characterize clinical groups in future studies .
24935084|Temporally unstructured electrical stimulation to the amygdala suppresses behavioral chronic seizures of the pilocarpine animal model .
24935084|Electrical stimulation applied to the basolateral amygdala in the pentylenetetrazole animal model of seizures may result in either a proconvulsant or an anticonvulsant effect depending on the interpulse intervals used : periodic or nonperiodic , respectively .
24935084|After 45 days of the pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus , male Wistar rats were submitted to a surgical procedure for the implantation of a bipolar electrical stimulation electrode in the right basolateral amygdala and were allowed to recover for seven days .
24938118|L-TLE had lower hippocampal volume than HC and IGE -LRB- p = 0.001 -RRB- , and all epilepsy groups had significantly lower amygdala volume than HC -LRB- p < = 0.004 -RRB- .
24938849|FINDINGS : Participants demonstrated elevated activation to cocaine -LRB- bilateral ventral striatum , dorsal caudate , amygdala -RRB- and response inhibition -LRB- bilateral anterior cingulate , insula , inferior frontal gyrus -RRB- cues in all hypothesized brain regions .
24939441|Participants in the PAD group displayed less activation in the right amygdala and the right middle temporal gyrus during AIC than did the healthy volunteers .
24939441|Reactivity within the amygdala in response to AIC was negatively correlated with AUQ-K scores among PAD .
24946038|In addition , the left amygdala and right forebrain were also enlarged .
24949867|The pooled and subgroup meta-analyses showed robust grey matter reductions in the right lentiform nucleus extending into the parahippocampus , the hippocampus and the amygdala , the bilateral medial frontal gyrus and the right subcallosal gyrus as well as a grey matter increase in the right lingual gyrus .
24954829|RESULTS : Greater activation responses to fearful , sad , and happy faces in the amygdala and its neighboring regions were found in children with greater life stress .
24954829|Finally , all children with greater life trauma showed greater bilateral amygdala and cingulate activity specific to sad faces but not the other emotional faces , although right amygdala activity was moderated by psychiatric status .
24962329|FINDINGS : The BP group exhibited significantly greater brain activation than the BPMJ group in the right amygdala -LRB- F = 4.14 , P = 0.046 -RRB- , left nucleus accumbens -LRB- F = 3.8 , P = 0.02 -RRB- , left thalamus -LRB- F = 3.8 , P < 0.05 -RRB- and the right thalamus -LRB- F = 6.2 , P = 0.02 -RRB- .
24962329|Left amygdala activation of the BPMJ group trended towards being significantly negatively correlated with the number of joints smoked -LRB- R = -0.4 , P = 0.06 -RRB- .
24965310|Therefore , we compared the connectivity of the hypothalamus , amygdala , and posterior cingulate cortex , each probing a distinct network related to energy homeostasis and reward , between obese subjects and lean subjects in the fasting state and after meal ingestion .
24965310|The amygdala was differentially connected to the right insula in obese compared with lean subjects .
24971049|Personal Distress was associated with amygdala and hypothalamus activation , Empathic Concern with the left ventral striatum , ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- VLPFC -RRB- , and supplemental motor area -LRB- SMA -RRB- activation , and Fantasy with the septal area , right SMA and VLPFC activation .
24972588|Case report : stimulation of the right amygdala induces transient changes in affective bias .
24972588|OBJECTIVE : This study examined the utility of a novel affective bias -LRB- AB -RRB- task in identifying transient mood changes induced by amygdala stimulation in a single rare participant .
24972588|RESULTS : Stimulation of the basolateral nucleus of the right amygdala at 50 Hz , 15 V , and 200 ?s pulse-width produced a significant positive shift in AB -LRB- t = -2.864 , df = 53 , P = .006 -RRB- , despite equivocal findings on self-reported mood -LRB- t = -.184 , df = 12 , P = .857 -RRB- .
24973255|RESULTS : Compared with the normal controls , PTSD patients showed increased local coherence in subcortical regions , including amygdala , hippocampus , thalamus , and putamen , and decreased local coherence in cortical regions , including medial prefrontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex .
24973255|Moreover , a correlation analysis of the ReHo measurement versus the severity of the disorder was performed , and highly positive correlation were observed in the right amygdala .
24977184|The fractional anisotropy -LRB- FA -RRB- and apparent diffusion coefficient -LRB- ADC -RRB- measurements of bilateral hippocampus , amygdala , fornix , cingulum , and parahippocampal gyrus were obtained as related components .
24977184|The ADC values of right amygdala and left cingulum interestingly showed negative relation and the left hippocampus represented positive relation with age .
24977349|RESULTS : Our findings revealed a significant increase in brain activity in WS-H versus WS-L patients in response to noxious heat in the right amygdala/parahippocampal gyrus and ventrolateral prefrontal and insular cortex -LRB- at a VoxelPThreshold = 0.01 -RRB- .
24977395|Like Tanner Stage , T and E ? predicted white matter and right amygdala growth across adolescence in both sexes , independent of age .
24977395|Although specificity was seen , sex hormones had strikingly similar relationships with white matter , gray matter , right amygdala , and bilateral caudate volumes , with larger changes in brain volume seen at early pubertal maturation -LRB- as indexed by lower hormone levels -RRB- , followed by less robust , or even reversals in growth , by late puberty .
24993897|Our results indicate that three of those strategies -LRB- Detachment , Expressive Suppression and Distraction -RRB- conjointly increase brain activation in a right prefronto-parietal regulation network and significantly reduce activation of the left amygdala .
24993897|Compared to the other regulation strategies , Reinterpretation specifically recruited a different control network comprising left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal gyrus and was not effective in downregulation of the amygdala .
24993897|Notably , Reinterpretation also proved to be the least effective strategy in neural terms , as measured by downregulation of amygdala activation .
24996397|During worry reappraisal , the non-anxious participants had greater FC between the left dlPFC and the medial PFC , as well as between the left AI and the medial PFC , and elderly GAD patients had greater FC between the PVN and the amygdala .
25000324|Performance measures of WM were unrelated to lobar volumes or CT , but were associated with volumes of hippocampus and amygdala .
25003207|The medial temporal lobe -LRB- MTL -RRB- is also involved in decoding facial expression and damage to the anterior MTL , including the amygdala , generally interferes with emotion recognition .
25009480|In contrast in bvFTD , integrity of emotion processing regions , including the orbitofrontal cortex , right amygdala and right insula , correlated with the extent emotion enhanced memory .
25018009|Larger left insula , left amygdala and right amygdala correlated positively with alpha power and alpha suppression , and SCLs ; all structures uniquely contributed to variance in arousal .
25019681|Compared to constant ISIs , variable -LRB- i.e. , less predictable -RRB- ISIs led to a general increase in reaction time and in right amygdala activation .
25019681|Depending on the cognitive demands required by the specific task , the left amygdala , the parietal cortex , the supplementary motor area , and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were engaged as well .
25023618|How functional coupling between the auditory cortex and the amygdala induces musical emotion : a single case study .
25023618|We studied the functional correlation between the auditory cortex -LRB- AC -RRB- and amygdala -LRB- AMY -RRB- through intracerebral recordings from both hemispheres in a single patient while she listened attentively to musical excerpts , which we compared to passive listening of a sequence of pure tones .
25027503|Lobe-based and voxel-based analysis confirmed that tasks requiring interpretation of emotions and intentions at more basic -LRB- less mentalized -RRB- levels -LRB- Tasks 1 and 2 -RRB- were more affected by temporo/insular lesions , with emotion recognition -LRB- Task 1 -RRB- being maximally impaired by anterior temporal and amygdala lesions and Task 2 -LRB- found to be a ` basic ' Theory of Mind task involving only limited mentalization -RRB- being mostly impaired by posterior temporoparietal lesions .
25028155|Within the schizophrenia group , these texture parameters correlated with volumes of the left hippocampus , right amygdala and cerebellum .
25033473|The hippocampus , amygdala , cingulate , and parahipocampal gyri volumes were estimated using FreeSurfer software .
25033473|Subjects with PTSD presented larger bilateral hippocampus and right amygdala , but secondary to the higher ETI .
25033473|In PTSD group there was a positive correlation between ETI with bilateral hippocampus , bilateral amygdala , and left parahippocampus .
25033473|Enlargement of hippocampus and amygdala volume was observed in subjects with PTSD , however secondary to early trauma experience .
25033474|Specifically , eight regions exhibited the abnormal participant coefficient or module degree , e.g. , left superior orbital frontal cortex and right amygdala .
25033474|The decreased FC was identified among the sub-network of 24 brain regions , e.g. , frontal cortex , supplementary motor area , amygdala , thalamus , and hippocampus .
25034314|The impact of puberty and social anxiety on amygdala activation to faces in adolescence .
25034314|These transitions coincide with changes in amygdala response to social and affective stimuli .
25034314|Utilizing an emotional face-matching task , we examined amygdala response to peer-aged neutral and fearful faces in relation to puberty and social anxiety in a sample of 60 adolescent females between the ages of 8 and 15 years .
25034314|We observed amygdala activation in response to both neutral and fearful faces compared to the control condition but did not observe differential amygdala activation between fearful and neutral faces .
25034314|Right amygdala activity in response to neutral faces was negatively correlated with puberty and positively correlated with social anxiety , and these effects were statistically independent .
25034314|Puberty and social anxiety did not relate to amygdala activation in response to fearful faces .
25036008|Fronto-limbic regions of interest -LRB- ROI ; bilateral amygdala , insula , subgenual and rostral anterior cingulate cortices -RRB- and whole-brain analyses were conducted to examine between-group differences in brain function .
25036008|RESULTS : ROI analyses revealed that patients had greater bilateral amygdala activity than HC in response to viewing fearful versus happy faces , which remained significant when controlling for comorbid anxiety .
25036008|Findings implicate elevated amygdalar arousal to negative stimuli in adolescents with depression and provide new evidence for a deficit in functioning of the saliency network , which may be a future target for early intervention and MDD treatment .
25042764|Our results demonstrate consistent working memory networks across genders , but also provide evidence for gender-specific networks whereby females consistently activate more limbic -LRB- e.g. , amygdala and hippocampus -RRB- and prefrontal structures -LRB- e.g. , right inferior frontal gyrus -RRB- , and males activate a distributed network inclusive of more parietal regions .
25051163|We performed whole-brain analyses as well as a region-of-interest approach on the hippocampal formation , anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala , correlating the number of depressive episodes .
25051163|The number of depressive episodes was negatively correlated with gray-matter volume in the right hippocampus and right amygdala .
25051163|The hippocampal and amygdala volume loss cumulating with the number of episodes might be explained either by repeated neurotoxic stress or alternatively by higher relapse rates in patients showing hippocampal atrophy .
25056573|Results indicated increased activation in the autism parents to faces in the amygdala -LRB- AMY -RRB- and the fusiform gyrus -LRB- FG -RRB- , 2 core face-processing regions .
25059532|Guanfacine modulates the emotional biasing of amygdala-prefrontal connectivity for cognitive control .
25059532|Functional interactions between amygdala and prefrontal cortex provide a cortical entry point for emotional cues to bias cognitive control .
25059532|Stimulation of ?2 adrenoceptors enhances the prefrontal control functions and blocks the amygdala-dependent encoding of emotional cues .
25059532|However , the impact of this stimulation on amygdala-prefrontal interactions and the emotional biasing of cognitive control have not been established .
25059532|We tested the effect of the ?2 adrenoceptor agonist guanfacine on psychophysiological interactions of amygdala with prefrontal cortex for the emotional biasing of response execution and inhibition .
25059532|Guanfacine moderated the effect of face emotion on the task-related functional connectivity of left and right amygdala with left inferior frontal gyrus compared to placebo , by selectively reversing the functional co-activation of the two regions for response execution cued by sad faces .
25059532|These results demonstrate the importance of functional interactions between amygdala and inferior frontal gyrus to both bottom-up biasing of cognitive control and top-down control of emotional processing , as well as for the ?2 adrenoceptor-mediated modulation of these processes .
25068667|METHOD : We conducted MRI scans of bilateral hippocampal and amygdala formations as well as intracranial and total brain volumes .
25100974|Outcome parameter were -LRB- 1 -RRB- skin conductance changes and -LRB- 2 -RRB- time-dependent brain activity -LRB- BOLD responses -RRB- in fear-related brain regions such as the amygdala , anterior cingulate cortex , insula , thalamus , orbitofrontal cortex , and medial prefrontal cortex .
25101236|This paper uses diffeomorphometry methods to quantify the order in which statistically significant morphometric change occurs in three medial temporal lobe regions , the amygdala , entorhinal cortex -LRB- ERC -RRB- , and hippocampus among subjects with symptomatic and preclinical Alzheimer 's disease -LRB- AD -RRB- .
25101236|The results demonstrate that the atrophy changepoint in the ERC occurs first , indicating significant change 8-10 years prior to onset , followed by the hippocampus , 2-4 years prior to onset , followed by the amygdala , 3 years prior to onset .
25102395|INTRODUCTION : Insular lobe is folded deep in the sylvian fissure , and the transsylvian transinsular approach is one of the most commonly used methods for lesions in the insula , basal ganglia , amygdala , and hippocampus .
25108541|OBJECTIVES : To determine if late preterm -LRB- LP -RRB- children differ from full term -LRB- FT -RRB- children in volumes of the cortex , hippocampus , corpus callosum , or amygdala and whether these differences are associated with anxiety symptoms at school-age .
25108541|There were no differences in hippocampal , callosal , or amygdala volumes or cortical thickness .
25113955|Regional thalamic micro-structural changes were assessed by parcelling the thalamus based on its connectivity to cortex and to amygdala and by measuring the mean diffusivity -LRB- MD -RRB- in each connectivity-defined sub-region .
25113955|Right thalamic sub-region projecting to amygdala and left thalamic sub-region projecting to motor cortex were also affected in DLB compared to controls .
25113955|Specific comparison between the two forms of dementia found differences : the sub-regions which project from thalamus to parieto-occipital cortex and to amygdala showed higher MD values in DLB compared to AD patients .
25119145|Disturbed cortico-amygdalar functional connectivity as pathophysiological correlate of working memory deficits in bipolar affective disorder .
25119145|In a previous functional magnetic resonance imaging study , we observed an abnormal hyperactivity of the amygdala in bipolar patients during articulatory rehearsal in verbal working memory .
25119145|In the present study , we investigated the dynamic neurofunctional interactions between the right amygdala and the brain systems that underlie verbal working memory in both bipolar patients and healthy controls .
25119145|We used the psychophysiological interaction approach in order to assess functional connectivity between the right amygdala and the brain regions involved in verbal working memory .
25119145|In healthy subjects , we found significant negative functional interactions between the right amygdala and multiple cortical brain areas involved in verbal working memory .
25119145|In comparison with the healthy control subjects , bipolar patients exhibited significantly reduced functional interactions of the right amygdala particularly with the right-hemispheric , i.e. , ipsilateral , cortical regions supporting verbal working memory .
25119145|Together with our previous finding of amygdala hyperactivity in bipolar patients during verbal rehearsal , the present results suggest that a disturbed right-hemispheric `` cognitive-emotional '' interaction between the amygdala and cortical brain regions underlying working memory may be responsible for amygdala hyperactivation and affects verbal working memory -LRB- deficits -RRB- in bipolar patients .
25120498|First , the common engagement of the right amygdala in young and older adults was driven by high arousing negative stimuli .
25120498|Second , complementing an age-related reduction in the subjective ratings for low arousing negative pictures , there were opposing patterns of activity in the rostral/ventral anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- and the amygdala , which showed increased vs. decreased responses , respectively , to low arousing negative pictures .
25127926|ADRA2B genotype differentially modulates stress-induced neural activity in the amygdala and hippocampus during emotional memory retrieval .
25127926|RATIONALE : Noradrenaline interacts with stress hormones in the amygdala and hippocampus to enhance emotional memory consolidation , but the noradrenergic-glucocorticoid interaction at retrieval , where stress impairs memory , is less understood .
25127926|OBJECTIVES : We used a genetic neuroimaging approach to investigate whether a genetic variation of the noradrenergic system impacts stress-induced neural activity in amygdala and hippocampus during recognition of emotional memory .
25127926|RESULTS : A genotype-dependent modulation of neural activity at retrieval was found in the bilateral amygdala and right hippocampus .
25127926|Deletion carriers showed decreased neural activity in the amygdala when recognizing emotional faces in control condition and increased amygdala activity under stress .
25127926|Noncarriers showed no differences in emotional modulated amygdala activation under stress or control .
25127926|CONCLUSION : The genotype-dependent effects of acute stress on neural activity in amygdala and hippocampus provide evidence for noradrenergic-glucocorticoid interaction in emotional memory retrieval .
25142952|Maladaptive social information processing in childhood predicts young men 's atypical amygdala reactivity to threat .
25142952|Although social information processing problems are correlated with heightened physiological responses to social threat , few studies have examined their associations with neural threat circuitry , specifically amygdala activation to social threat .
25142952|RESULTS : Path models indicated that maladaptive social information-processing at ages 10 and 11 predicted increased left amygdala reactivity to fear faces , an ambiguous threat , at age 20 while accounting for childhood antisocial behavior , empathy , IQ , and socioeconomic status .
25142952|Exploratory analyses indicated that aggressive response generation - the tendency to respond to threat with reactive aggression - predicted left amygdala reactivity to fear faces and was concurrently associated with empathy , antisocial behavior , and hostile attributional bias , whereas hostile attributional bias correlated with IQ .
25142952|Although unrelated to social information-processing problems , bilateral amygdala reactivity to anger faces at age 20 was unexpectedly predicted by low IQ at age 11 .
25142952|Amygdala activation did not mediate associations between social information processing and number of criminal arrests , but both impulsiveness at age 22 and arrests were correlated with right amygdala reactivity to anger facial expressions at age 20 .
25142952|CONCLUSIONS : Childhood social information processing and IQ predicted young men 's amygdala response to threat a decade later , which suggests that childhood social-cognitive characteristics are associated with the development of neural threat processing and adult adjustment .
25151094|By these means we could reveal that three key structures contribute to building up the feeling of self , namely insula -LRB- interoceptive modulator -RRB- , amygdala -LRB- emotional modulator -RRB- and putamen -LRB- motor modulator -RRB- .
25151116|Performance measures of WM were unrelated to lobar volumes or CT , but were associated with volumes of hippocampus and amygdala .
25151338|To assess pair-wise comparisons and potential confounders , mean activation data were extracted only from clusters within regions previously implicated in emotion regulation -LRB- including amygdala and ventral prefrontal regions -RRB- .
25155256|CONCLUSIONS : These findings suggest that , in adolescents with GAD , abnormalities in cortical thickness are present in an ensemble of regions responsible for fear learning , fear extinction , reflective functioning -LRB- e.g. , mentalization -RRB- , and regulation of the amygdala .
25165974|We hypothesized that the putatively facilitated access should be reflected in increased activation of the amygdala upon bilateral EMDR stimulation even in healthy subjects .
25165974|RESULTS : Contrasting disgusting vs. neutral picture stimuli confirmed the expected robust effect of amygdala activation for all auditory stimulation conditions .
25165974|The interaction analysis with the type of auditory stimulation revealed a specific increase in activation of the right amygdala for the bilateral alternating auditory stimulation .
25172408|Our results show that activity levels of left subgenual anterior cingulate gyrus -LRB- ACG -RRB- , right amygdala , left Brodmann area 10 -LRB- orbitofrontal cortex -RRB- , and right thalamus were inversely correlated with BRACHA scores and were activated with frustrative non-reward during the affective Posner Task .
25172408|In addition , 11 TNF related gene expressions were significantly correlated with activation of amygdala or ACG during the affective Posner Task .
25184336|Reduced amygdala and ventral striatal activity to happy faces in PTSD is associated with emotional numbing .
25184336|Relative to controls , PTSD participants revealed lower activation to happy -LRB- - neutral -RRB- faces in ventral striatum and and a trend for reduced activation in left amygdala .
25191504|OBJECTIVE : Recent pediatric studies have suggested a correlation between decreased amygdala volume and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder -LRB- ADHD -RRB- symptoms , including the emotional dysregulation .
25191504|To investigate the hypothesis that medication treatment of ADHD specifically improves amygdala function , we used -LRB- 1 -RRB- H magnetic resonance spectroscopy -LRB- MRS -RRB- to study the effect of 12 weeks of treatment with daily 20 mg long-acting methylphenidate on the Glu/Cr , NAA/Cr , Cho/Cr , and mI/Cr ratios in the amygdala of medication-nave children with ADHD .
25191504|Low Time Echo MRS scans sampled voxels of interest -LRB- 1.5  1.5  2.0 -RRB- from both the right and left amygdala .
25191504|On 1H MRS , there were no statistical significant differences of NAA/Cr ratio , Cho/Cr ratio , mI/Cr ratio before and after 12 weeks administration of 20 mg long-acting methylphenidate both in the right and left amygdala .
25191504|In addition , Glu/Cr ratio decreased 14.1 % in the right amygdala -LRB- p = 0.029 -RRB- and 11.4 % in the left amygdala -LRB- p = 0.008 -RRB- .
25194011|METHODS : Long-term video EEGs were retrospectively reviewed in 21 patients , 7 men and 14 women aged 13 to 67 years , diagnosed as mTLE with MRI lesions in the mesial temporal structures -LRB- hippocampal sclerosis in 20 cases , amygdala hypertrophy in 1 case -RRB- .
25206618|In these patients , there was an increase in subcortical gray matter volume in the bilateral putamen and accumbens , right pallidum , right caudate nucleus , and left amygdala .
25212487|Voxel-based morphometry was used to compare GMV in a priori regions including the medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala/hippocampus .
25218645|Previous work has associated antisocial behaviour in psychopathy with abnormalities in a ventral temporo-amygdala-orbitofrontal network .
25220389|Positive affect scores correlated with the betweenness values of the right orbital frontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- and the right putamen in the positive emotional network ; negative affect scores correlated with the betweenness values of the left OFC and the left amygdala in the negative emotional network .
25223729|Diffusion tensor imaging was performed to obtain fractional anisotropy -LRB- FA -RRB- of the uncinate fasciculus -LRB- UF -RRB- , and mean diffusivity -LRB- MD -RRB- of the amygdala -LRB- AM -RRB- and hippocampus -LRB- HC -RRB- .
25224633|Results from human neuroimaging studies support that a frontal-striatal-amygdala neural circuitry is important for approach-avoidance learning .
25225374|Here we show that extraordinary altruists can be distinguished from controls by their enhanced volume in right amygdala and enhanced responsiveness of this structure to fearful facial expressions , an effect that predicts superior perceptual sensitivity to these expressions .
25225374|These results mirror the reduced amygdala volume and reduced responsiveness to fearful facial expressions observed in psychopathic individuals .
25226554|We therefore investigated whether variation in hippocampus , amygdala , orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- and anterior cingulate cortex volumes at age 12 years mediated a putative association between 5-HTTLPR genotype and first onset of major depressive disorder -LRB- MDD -RRB- between age 13-19 years , in a longitudinal study of 174 adolescents -LRB- 48 % males -RRB- .
25227744|In Alzheimer 's disease , however , emotion processing deficits were associated with atrophy in a different set of brain regions , including the right cingulate and the bilateral insulae , as well as the hippocampi , right amygdala and nucleus accumbens bilaterally .
25227944|The structure of the amygdala associates with human sexual permissiveness : evidence from voxel-based morphometry .
25227944|Sexual permissiveness was negatively correlated with regional gray matter density of the structures involving the right amygdala and surrounding areas , and positively correlated with regional white matter density of the white matter area that spread around the left amygdala to the hypothalamus area .
25231241|Independent of time , larger hippocampal volumes were associated with higher PA , and negative affect was associated with smaller left amygdala volume .
25231851|Despite its extensive expression in the hippocampus , amygdala and other limbic system structures , the effects of VIP on anxiety and depression have not yet been fully investigated .
25246750|The FMRI results revealed that the peer-rejection group exhibited greater and remarkably more extensive activation of brain regions encompassing the amygdala , orbitofrontal cortex and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in response to negative feedback stimuli of emotional faces .
25253279|Greater activation to biological than to scrambled motion in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus -LRB- pSTS -RRB- and right amygdala were positively correlated with the diversity of social-network roles .
25260201|IGA participants also showed significant lower white matter density in the inferior frontal gyrus , insula , amygdala , and anterior cingulate than healthy controls -LRB- all p < 0.05 -RRB- .
25262497|Neuroticism also correlated positively with connectivity between pons and amygdala , vestibulo-cerebellum and amygdala , inferior frontal gyrus and supra-marginal gyrus , and inferior frontal gyrus and para-striate cortex .
25262497|Introversion correlated positively with amygdala activity and negatively with connectivity between amygdala and inferior frontal gyrus .
25263277|RESULTS : The right amygdala was significantly larger in unaffected BD offspring compared to BD offspring with psychiatric disorders and HC .
25263277|DISCUSSION : The size of the amygdala may be a marker of disease susceptibility in offspring of BD parents .
25263358|RESULTS : Compared with the normal controls , the patients with MDDs showed significantly decreased regional homogeneity in the left posterior cingulated gyrus , bilateral inferior temporal gyrus , bilateral superior temporal gyrus , left inferior frontal gyrus , left hippocampa gyrus , left posterior central gyrus , left angular gyrus , right amygdala , right orbital frontal gyrus , right supplementary motor area , and right cerebellar lobe .
25264291|CONCLUSIONS : Abnormalities in the subcortical structures , such as amygdala , hypothalamus and basal ganglia , are associated with atypical emotional-face processing in individuals with ASD .
25271073|These OFC subregions mainly covaried with the prefrontal and temporal cortices , cingulate cortex and amygdala .
25278851|Down-regulation of amygdala activation with real-time fMRI neurofeedback in a healthy female sample .
25278851|Psychiatric conditions of emotion dysregulation are often characterized by difficulties in regulating the activity of limbic regions such as the amygdala .
25278851|Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- rt-fMRI -RRB- allows to feedback brain activation and opens the possibility to establish a neurofeedback -LRB- NF -RRB- training of amygdala activation , e.g. , for subjects suffering from emotion dysregulation .
25278851|As a first step , we investigated whether feedback of the amygdala response to aversive scenes can improve down-regulation of amygdala activation .
25278851|One group of healthy female participants received amygdala feedback -LRB- N = 16 -RRB- and a control group was presented with feedback from a control region located in the basal ganglia -LSB- N -LRB- sum -RRB- = 32 -RSB- .
25278851|Both groups showed down-regulation of the amygdala response during training .
25278851|Feedback from the amygdala but not from the control region was associated with down-regulation of the right amygdala in the transfer test .
25278851|We present a proof-of-concept study using rt-fMRI-NF for amygdala down-regulation in the presence of aversive scenes .
25278851|Results are in line with a potential benefit of NF training for amygdala regulation .
25279729|WM atrophy was observed predominantly in the regions that regulate food intake , such as the bilateral basal ganglia , the right amygdala , and the left insula .
25279855|Adolescents scoring low on the ICU-Y showed a positive correlation between right amygdala responses and severity of violation ratings ; those with high ICU-Y scores showed a negative correlation .
25279855|While viewing unpleasant pictures with and without moral transgressions , PCL-YV scores were negatively correlated with hemodynamic responses in the left amygdala .
25281881|We assume that long-term meditation practice enhances frontal top-down control over fast automatic salience detection , based on amygdala functions .
25286145|We found a significant correlation between performance and the variability of the resting-state fMRI signal in the basal ganglia , hippocampus , amygdala , thalamus , insula , and regions in the frontal and temporal lobes , regions important for spatial exploration , learning , memory , and decision making .
25288025|The electroencephalographic features suggested that an epileptogenic zone is present in the mesial temporal structures -LRB- i.e. , amygdala and/or hippocampus -RRB- .
25298173|Right and left amygdalae activation in patients with major depression receiving antidepressant treatment , as revealed by fMRI .
25298173|BACKGROUND : A differential contribution of the right and left amygdalae to affective information processing has been proposed .
25298173|In this study , we used a pre - and post-treatment -LRB- escitalopram -RRB- design to analyze the relative differences between neural activity in the right and left amygdalae during exposure to emotional stimuli in currently depressed patients .
25298173|To the best of our knowledge , this study is to compare neural activity between the left and right amygdalae in people with depression .
25298173|We used amygdala region-of-interest analysis to evaluate the hemodynamic response during exposure to colored emotional pictures .
25298173|Each individual had lateralized amygdala activity , and the direction of asymmetry persisted following treatment .
25298173|Amygdala responses to four types of emotional stimuli did not significantly change -LRB- p > 0.05 -RRB- with treatment in either the right or the left amygdala .
25298173|However , the difference in neural activity between the right and left amygdalae was greater after treatment , and the variation in neural activity was larger in the left amygdala .
25298173|CONCLUSIONS : We found that the response between the right and left amygdala did not differ in terms of time series , although activity increased after pharmaceutical treatment for each emotion tested .
25309400|Results of the emotion contrast revealed a negative correlation between PCL-R scores and activation in the right amygdala and rostral anterior cingulate .
25318546|This predictor is based on the shape diffeomorphometry patterns of subcortical and ventricular structures -LRB- left and right amygdala , hippocampus , thalamus , caudate , putamen , globus pallidus , and lateral ventricle -RRB- of 607 baseline scans from the Alzheimer 's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database , including a total of 210 healthy control subjects , 222 MCI subjects , and 175 AD subjects .
25318546|Statistically significant correlation maps were observed between the shape diffeomorphometry features of each of the 14 structures , especially the bilateral amygdala , hippocampus , lateral ventricle , and two neuropsychological test scores -- the Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Behavior Section and the Mini-Mental State Examination .
25331597|Both rostral clusters were connected to the amygdala and hippocampus and associated with memory and social cognitive tasks in functional decoding .
25339737|Voxel activity patterns in PRC , temporopolar cortex , and amygdala carried information about individual objects , whereas activity patterns in the PHC and posterior hippocampus carried information about the configuration of spatial locations that was to be remembered .
25339875|Early life stress and macaque amygdala hypertrophy : preliminary evidence for a role for the serotonin transporter gene .
25339875|BACKGROUND : Children exposed to early life stress -LRB- ELS -RRB- exhibit enlarged amygdala volume in comparison to controls .
25339875|The primary goal of this study was to examine amygdala volumes in bonnet macaques subjected to maternal variable foraging demand -LRB- VFD -RRB- rearing , a well-established model of ELS .
25339875|Preliminary analyses examined the interaction of ELS and the serotonin transporter gene on amygdala volume .
25339875|Secondary analyses were conducted to examine the association between amygdala volume and other stress-related variables previously found to distinguish VFD and non-VFD reared animals .
25339875|RESULTS : Left amygdala volume was larger in VFD vs. control macaques .
25339875|Larger amygdala volume was associated with : `` high '' cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of corticotropin releasing-factor -LRB- CRF -RRB- determined when the animals were in adolescence -LRB- mean age = 2.7 years -RRB- ; reduced fractional anisotropy -LRB- FA -RRB- of the anterior limb of the internal capsule -LRB- ALIC -RRB- during young adulthood -LRB- mean age = 5.2 years -RRB- and timid anxiety-like responses to an intruder during full adulthood -LRB- mean age = 8.4 years -RRB- .
25339875|Right amygdala volume varied inversely with left hippocampal neurogenesis assessed in late adulthood -LRB- mean age = 8.7 years -RRB- .
25339875|Exploratory analyses also showed a gene-by-environment effect , with VFD-reared macaques with a single short allele of the serotonin transporter gene exhibiting larger amygdala volume compared to VFD-reared subjects with only the long allele and normally reared controls .
25339875|CONCLUSION : These data suggest that the left amygdala exhibits hypertrophy after ELS , particularly in association with the serotonin transporter gene , and that amygdala volume variation occurs in concert with other key stress-related behavioral and neurobiological parameters observed across the lifecycle .
25339875|Future research is required to understand the mechanisms underlying these diverse and persistent changes associated with ELS and amygdala volume .
25344944|The active and placebo groups exhibited different patterns of right and left amygdala activation with training .
25344944|Across all participants irrespective of group , individuals with greater left amygdala activation in the threat-bias contrast prior to training exhibited greater symptom reduction .
25344944|After accounting for baseline amygdala activation , greater symptom reduction was associated with assignment to the active training group .
25344944|Greater left amygdala activation at baseline predicted reductions in social anxiety symptoms following ABM .
25355453|In particular , qT1 decreases in bilateral temporal lobes , right parietal lobes , basal ganglia including left putamen , left caudate nucleus and left amygdala , and left hippocampus/parahippocampus ; qT2 decreases in left putamen and increases in left precuneus .
25360093|The results revealed activations in the brain areas involved in sensory integration , both in experts and control subjects -LRB- insula , frontal operculum , orbitofrontal cortex , amygdala -RRB- .
25365801|Childhood maltreatment and amygdala connectivity in methamphetamine dependence : a pilot study .
25365801|METHODS : We conducted a pilot study of the relationship between childhood maltreatment -LRB- evaluated with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire ; Bernstein and Fink 1998 -RRB- and resting-state functional connectivity of the amygdala -LRB- bilateral region of interest -RRB- with functional magnetic resonance imaging in 15 abstinent , methamphetamine-dependent research participants .
25365801|Within regions that showed connectivity with the amygdala as a function of maltreatment , we also evaluated whether amygdala connectivity was associated positively with negative affect and negatively with healthy emotional processing .
25365801|RESULTS : The results indicated that childhood maltreatment was positively associated with resting-state connectivity between the amygdala and right hippocampus , right parahippocampal gyrus , right inferior temporal gyrus , right orbitofrontal cortex , cerebellum , and brainstem .
25365801|Furthermore , connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampus was positively related to measures of depression , trait anxiety , and emotion dysregulation , and negatively related to self-compassion and dispositional mindfulness .
25367022|Reduced anterior insula , enlarged amygdala in alcoholism and associated depleted von Economo neurons .
25367022|Here , we performed brain magnetic resonance imaging to measure volumes of the insula and amygdala , a structure with reciprocal insular connections , in 26 alcohol-dependent patients and 24 healthy volunteers -LRB- aged 22-56 years , nine females in each group -RRB- .
25367022|Volumetric measurements of the amygdala were obtained using a model-based segmentation/registration tool .
25367022|Furthermore , alcohol-dependent patients , compared with healthy volunteers , had bilaterally increased amygdala volumes .
25367022|The left amygdala was increased by 28 % and the right by 29 % , normalized to total brain volumes .
25367022|The pattern of neuroanatomical change observed in our alcohol-dependent patients might result in a loss of top-down control of amygdala function , potentially contributing to impaired social cognition as well as an inability to control negatively reinforced alcohol seeking and use .
25367666|The symptoms stem from common pathophysiologic and anatomic substrates of these two conditions , localized in the limbic system , especially the amygdala .
25370452|The five children who exhibited hyperactivation at baseline evidenced decreased activation in subcortical regions critical for regulating the flow of stimulation and conveying signals of salience to the cortex-the thalamus , amygdala , and hippocampus .
25372882|Altered resting-state amygdala functional connectivity after 36 hours of total sleep deprivation .
25372882|OBJECTIVES : Recent neuroimaging studies have identified a potentially critical role of the amygdala in disrupted emotion neurocircuitry in individuals after total sleep deprivation -LRB- TSD -RRB- .
25372882|However , connectivity between the amygdala and cerebral cortex due to TSD remains to be elucidated .
25372882|In this study , we used resting-state functional MRI -LRB- fMRI -RRB- to investigate the functional connectivity changes of the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- and centromedial amygdala -LRB- CMA -RRB- in the brain after 36 h of TSD .
25372882|CONCLUSION : These findings demonstrate that disturbance in amygdala related circuits may contribute to TSD psychophysiology and suggest that functional connectivity studies of the amygdala during the resting state may be used to discern aberrant patterns of coupling within these circuits after TSD .
25376429|In the nonregulation block , females showed greater activation of the left amygdala and the right STG during stress than males while males recruited the putamen more robustly in this condition .
25377694|Accumulating evidence indicates that emotional empathy depends on coordinated functions of orbitofrontal cortex , anterior insula , anterior cingulate , temporal pole , and amygdala , but few studies have investigated effects of lesions to white matter tracts that connect these structures .
25379440|In addition , there were significant increases in grey matter volume in the left mid-insula , the right insula , left and right primary motor cortices , left premotor cortex , left hippocampus and within the brainstem and cerebellum , and significant decreases in the mPFC , occipital lobe , right posterior cingulate cortex , left cerebellar cortex and the left and right amygdala in OSA , but there was no overlap between these structural changes and the functional changes in OSA .
25385466|RESULTS : Our results showed no significant differences in ratio of N-acetyl aspartate -LRB- NAA -RRB- , creatine -LRB- Cr -RRB- and choline-related compounds in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- and amygdala-hippocampus regions of cases compared with controls .
25386133|The region of interest -LRB- ROI -RRB- analysis showed stronger right amygdala activation to facial expressions in participants with lower relative to higher educational attainment -LRB- HE -RRB- .
25386133|The psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed that participants with HE exhibited stronger right amygdala-right insula connectivity during perception of emotional and neutral facial expressions .
25389397|Antagonistic interactions between brain regions implicated in emotion processing , e.g. , amygdala , and brain regions involved in cognitive control , e.g. , dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- dlPFC , dmPFC -RRB- , may play an important role in coping with emotional distraction .
25389397|We previously reported prolonged reaction times associated with amygdala hyperreactivity during emotional distraction in interpersonally traumatized borderline personality disorder -LRB- BPD -RRB- patients compared to healthy controls -LRB- HC -RRB- : Participants performed a working memory task , while neutral versus negative distractors -LRB- interpersonal scenes from the International Affective Picture System -RRB- were presented .
25389397|The bilateral amygdala and bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- dACC -RRB- were defined as seed regions of interest .
25389397|During emotional distraction , reduced amygdala connectivity with clusters in the left dorsolateral and ventrolateral PFC was observed in the whole group .
25389397|Compared to HC , BPD patients showed a stronger coupling of both seeds with a cluster in the right dmPFC and stronger positive amygdala connectivity with bilateral -LRB- para -RRB- hippocampus .
25389397|Reaction times positively predicted amygdala connectivity with right dmPFC and -LRB- para -RRB- hippocampus , while dissociation positively predicted amygdala connectivity with right ACC during emotional distraction in patients .
25398299|In accordance with the model predictions , evidence for a double dissociation was found in the brain activation patterns : Secondary-level processes engaged parts of the limbic system-specifically , the right hemispheric amygdala .
25404919|Patients with PBD , relative to TD , showed greater activation in regions of the right amygdala , parahippocampal gyrus , medial PFC , left ventral striatum , and cerebellum and lower activation in the right VLPFC and the DLPFC .
25410497|There were significant inflammatory responses in the cortex , hippocampus , thalamus , and amygdala 6 hr after mBBI , as evidenced by increased levels of the inflammatory markers associated with activation of microglia and macrophages , ionized calcium binding adaptor 1 -LRB- IBA1 -RRB- , impairment of the blood-brain barrier , and significant neuronal losses .
25410497|There were significant increases in phosphorylated Tau -LRB- p-Tau -RRB- levels , a putative precursor to the development of neuroencephalopathy , as early as 6 hr after mBBI in the cortex and the hippocampus but not in the thalamus or the amygdala .
25414039|Relative to placebo , heroin acutely reduced the fear-induced modulation of connectivity from the left fusiform gyrus to the left amygdala and from the right amygdala to the right orbitofrontal cortex in dependent patients .
25414039|Both of these amygdala-related connectivity strengths were significantly increased in patients after placebo treatment -LRB- acute withdrawal -RRB- compared to healthy controls , whose connectivity estimates did not differ from those of patients after heroin injection .
25414039|Moreover , we found positive correlations between the left fusiform gyrus to amygdala connectivity and different stress responses , as well as between the right amygdala to orbitofrontal cortex connectivity and levels of craving .
25414039|Our findings indicate that the increased amygdala-related connectivity during fearful face processing after the placebo treatment in heroin-dependent patients transiently normalizes after acute heroin maintenance treatment .
25414039|Furthermore , this study suggests that the assessment of amygdala-related connectivity during fear processing may provide a prognostic tool to assess stress levels in heroin-dependent patients and to quantify the efficacy of maintenance treatments in drug addiction .
2541866|Lasting increase in excitatory amino acid receptor-mediated polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis in the amygdala/pyriform cortex of amygdala-kindled rats .
2541866|We previously demonstrated that ibotenate-stimulated polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis , determined as the accumulation of -LSB- 3H -RSB- inositol 1-phosphate , significantly increased in the amygdala/pyriform cortex -LRB- AM/PC -RRB- 24 h and 7 days after the last seizure in AM-kindled rats .
25433424|Decreased amygdala-insula resting state connectivity in behaviorally and emotionally dysregulated youth .
25433424|After adjusting for demographic variables , two dimensional measures showed significant inverse relationships with resting state connectivity , regardless of diagnosis : 1 -RRB- PGBI-10M with amygdala-left posterior insula/bilateral putamen ; and 2 -RRB- depressive symptoms with amygdala-right posterior insula connectivity .
25433424|Resting state connectivity between amygdala and posterior insula decreased with increasing severity of behavioral and emotional dysregulation and depression ; this suggests an intrinsic functional uncoupling of key neural regions supporting emotion processing and regulation .
2543558|Repeated microinjection of 10 micrograms ME into the right amygdala -LRB- AM -RRB- of male Wistar rats led to development of generalized convulsions .
25438046|When processing negative pictures , low PS -LRB- vs. high PS -RRB- subjects showed higher amygdala and right orbito-frontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- activity but lower left OFC activity .
25438046|For positive or neutral stimuli , low PS subjects showed lower activity in the amygdala , striatum , and hippocampus .
25438046|These results suggest that low PS may involve an imbalance in processing distinct emotional inputs , with greater reactivity to aversive information in regions involved in avoidance behaviour -LRB- amygdala , OFC -RRB- and dampened response to positive and neutral stimuli across circuits subserving motivated behaviour -LRB- striatum , hippocampus , amygdala -RRB- .
25443451|OBJECTIVE : To explore the involvement of medial temporal lobe structures such as the hippocampus , amygdala , and entorhinal cortex -LRB- EC -RRB- in memory consolidation by volumetric magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- .
25443451|METHODS : Sixty-two consecutive patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy -LRB- MMTLE -RRB- were assessed using the Clinical Memory Scale -LRB- CMS -RRB- and MRI to measure the volumes of the hippocampus , amygdala , and EC .
25447235|We observed a significant increase in binding of -LSB- -LRB- 11 -RRB- C -RSB- DPA-713 to the translocator protein -LRB- TSPO -RRB- , a marker of brain injury and repair , in several brain regions , such as the supramarginal gyrus and right amygdala , in 9 former NFL players compared to 9 age-matched , healthy controls .
25448432|Infusion of the GABA-A agonist muscimol in the left DLS immediately after a single experience of FST prevented and infusion in the left or the right amygdala impaired recall of the acquired levels of immobility in a probe test performed 24h later .
25448544|Considerable numbers of FG-cells and PHA-L-fibers were present in the left side of the medial amygdala , ventral lateral septum , preoptic area , bed nucleus of stria terminalis , dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus , arcuate nucleus , periventricular nucleus of thalamus , and midbrain central gray .
25448779|Altered gray matter density and disrupted functional connectivity of the amygdala in adults with Internet gaming disorder .
25448779|The subjects with IGD had a lower GMD over the bilateral amygdala than the controls .
25448779|Further , the subjects with IGD had lower FC with the left amygdala over the left dorsolateral prefrontal lobe -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- and with the right amygdala over the left DLPFC and orbital frontal lobe -LRB- OFL -RRB- .
25448779|They also had higher FC with the bilateral amygdala over the contralateral insula than the controls .
25448779|The FC between the left amygdala and DLPFC was negatively correlated with impulsivity .
25448779|The FC of the right amygdala to the left DLPFC and orbital frontal lobe was also negatively correlated with impulsivity .
25448779|Our results indicated that the altered GMD over the amygdala might represent vulnerability to IGD , such as impulsivity .
25448779|Further analysis of the amygdala demonstrated impaired FC to the frontal lobe , which represents impulsivity .
25448779|CONCLUSION : The results of this study suggested that the amygdala plays a very influential role in the mechanism of IGD .
25451430|RESULTS : Higher baseline Shank3 levels predicted antidepressant response at Days 1 -LRB- r = -.39 , p = .047 -RRB- , 2 -LRB- r = -.45 , p = .02 -RRB- , and 3 -LRB- r = -.42 , p = .03 -RRB- and were associated with larger average -LRB- r = .58 , p = .02 -RRB- and right amygdala volume -LRB- r = .65 , p = .009 -RRB- .
25451430|Greater baseline Shank3 also predicted increased glucose metabolism in the hippocampus -LRB- r = .51 , p = .04 -RRB- and amygdala -LRB- r = .58 , p = .02 -RRB- .
25451430|CONCLUSIONS : Shank3 is a potential biomarker of antidepressant response to ketamine that correlates with baseline amygdala volume and increased glucose metabolism in the amygdala and hippocampus .
25462396|Contrasting and convergent patterns of amygdala connectivity in mania and depression : a resting-state study .
25462396|Left and right amygdala seed-to-voxel based functional connectivity were assessed and compared among the three groups .
25462396|RESULTS : Compared to healthy controls , both BM and BD groups showed reduced functional connectivity between bilateral amygdala and inferior frontal gyrus -LRB- orbital -RRB- , striatum , right lingual gyrus and posterior cerebellar lobe .
25462396|Furthermore right amygdala-hippocampal connectivity was decreased in BD but increased in BM .
25462396|CONCLUSIONS : The presence of substantial overlap in the pattern of disturbed connectivity between amygdala and frontal , striatal , lingual and cerebellar regions suggests mood state-independent dysconnectivity .
25462396|The contrasting pattern of functional connectivity between right amygdala and hippocampus in BD and BM provides a novel lead to the probable mechanistic differences in these two extremes of mood states .
25462799|We hypothesized that the neural networks for guilty feelings are widespread and include the insula , inferior parietal lobule -LRB- IPL -RRB- , amygdala , subgenual cingulate cortex -LRB- SCC -RRB- , and ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- , which are essential for cognitions of guilt .
25463465|In contrast , only the fALFF in the right amygdala reliably predicted affective well-being .
25463465|Furthermore , emotional intelligence partially mediated the effects of the right pSTG and thalamus on cognitive well-being , as well as the effect of the right amygdala on affective well-being .

25464763|The role of GABAergic system of amygdala in vegetative and behavioral manifestations of conditioned fear was studied in groups of active and passive rabbits , selected upon testing in open field and light-dark chamber .
25464763|Solutions of GABA -LRB- A -RRB- - receptor agonist -LRB- muscimol , 0.1 ?g / ?L -RRB- or antagonist -LRB- bicuculline methbromide , 0.5 ?g / ?L -RRB- were applied to the right or left basal nucleus of amygdala after conditioning .
25464763|Activation of the left amygdala by bicuculline resulted in the increased probability of active locomotor reactions in active rabbits , activation of the right amygdale , on the contrary , increased probability of freezing .
25464763|The results evidence the non-equivalence of amygdalar GABAergic system in active and passive animals .
25465122|Neuroimaging results showed that fearful bodies activated the left amygdala and extrastriate cortex when consciously perceived as well as when extinguished .
25465169|CONCLUSIONS : The preliminary findings indicate increased structural integrity - supporting enhanced connectivity - between right amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex in PTSD .
25465169|Although based on a small sample , these microstructural observations are consistent with a functional model suggesting increased amygdala responsivity in association with anterior cingulate modulation in PTSD .
25465747|RESULTS : Compared with healthy controls , akinetic-rigid -LRB- AR -RRB- subjects had increased ReHo mainly in right amygdala , left putamen , bilateral angular gyrus , bilateral medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- MPFC -RRB- , and decreased ReHo in left post cingulate gyrus/precuneus -LRB- PCC/PCu -RRB- and bilateral thalamus .
25465747|These results indicate that AR and TD subgroups both represent altered spontaneous neural activity in default-mode regions and striatum , and AR subjects exhibit more changed neural activity in the mesolimbic cortex -LRB- amygdala -RRB- but TD in the cerebellar regions .
25467383|Depression score was negatively correlated with left NAcc volume in patients , whereas a positive correlation was found between the daily opioid dose and the volume of the right amygdala .
25479816|In an fMRI face-viewing task , TD and undiagnosed sibling -LRB- SIB -RRB- children -LRB- 5-18 years -RRB- showed face specialization in the right amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex , with left fusiform and right amygdala face specialization increasing with age in TD subjects .
25479816|In ASD , face specialization was minimal but increased with age in the right fusiform and decreased with age in the left amygdala , suggesting atypical development of a frontal-amygdala-fusiform system which is strongly linked to detecting salience and processing facial information .
25485710|This study was designed to test the prediction that individual differences in the tendency to trust are associated with regional gray matter volume within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- , amygdala and anterior insula .
25485710|Greater right amygdala volume is associated with the tendency to rate faces as more trustworthy and distrustworthy -LRB- U-shaped function -RRB- .
25486393|Because common structural abnormalities are present in reward and affective brain regions in alcoholics and those with familial alcoholism , the current study examined the relationship between familial loading of AUDs and volumes of the amygdala and nucleus accumbens -LRB- NAcc -RRB- in largely alcohol-naive adolescents , ages 12-16 years -LRB- N = 140 -RRB- .
25486393|METHOD : The amygdala and NAcc were delineated on each participant 's T1-weighted anatomical scan , using FMRIB Software Library 's FMRIB Integrated Registration & Segmentation Tool , and visually inspected for accuracy and volume outliers .
25486393|Multiple regressions , with age and sex controlled for , examined the association between FHD and left and right amygdala and NAcc volume/ICV .
25496966|We found higher left amygdala/hippocampal activation during the luteal phase and higher right amygdala/hippocampal activation during the follicular phase .
25496966|The observed pattern of cycle-dependent functional lateralization of the amygdala/hippocampal complex is consistent with findings on cycle-related behavioral variations and on sex differences in lateralization of activity in amygdala and hippocampus .
25497442|When dividing the ultra-high-risk group in those with a genetic risk vs. those with attenuated psychotic symptoms , the former showed left anterior frontal , right caudate , as well as a smaller right hippocampus , and amygdala reduction , while the latter subgroup showed right middle temporal cortical reductions -LRB- each compared to healthy controls -RRB- .
25497442|Our findings in a clinical psychosis high-risk cohort demonstrate variability of brain structural changes according to subgroup and background of elevated risk , suggesting frontal and possibly also hippocampal/amygdala changes in individuals with genetic susceptibility .

25505429|Pre-treatment amygdala volume predicts electroconvulsive therapy response .
25505429|Based on the neuroplasticity hypothesis , volumes of the amygdala and hippocampus are possible candidates for predicting treatment outcome .
25505429|Therefore , this prospective cohort study examines the predictive value of amygdala and hippocampal volumes for the effectiveness of ECT .
25505429|METHODS : Prior to ECT , 53 severely unipolar depressed patients -LSB- mean age 57  14 years ; 40 % -LRB- n = 21 -RRB- male -RSB- received structural magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- at 1.5 T. Normalized amygdala and hippocampal volumes were calculated based on automatic segmentation by FreeSurfer -LRB- FS -RRB- .
25505429|RESULTS : A larger amygdala volume independently and significantly predicted a lower post-ECT MADRS score -LRB- ? = -0.347 , P = 0.013 -RRB- .
25505429|The left amygdala volume had greater predictive value for treatment outcome relative to the right amygdala volume .
25505429|CONCLUSION : A larger pre-treatment amygdala volume predicted more effective ECT , independent of other known predictors .
25505869|In addition , structural volumes were calculated for the thalamus , caudate , putamen , amygdala , and hippocampus , using the FreeSurfer software .

25517193|Recent studies on harmful intentions have refined this network by showing the specific involvement of the ACC , amygdala , and ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- in early stages -LRB- within 200 ms -RRB- of information processing .
25522360|BACKGROUND : Extinction of conditioned fear is an associative learning process that involves communication among the hippocampus , medial prefrontal cortex , and amygdala .
25522360|Strength of connectivity between the hippocampus and the anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , and between the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- , may influence fear-potentiated startle -LRB- FPS -RRB- responses during extinction .
25522395|Oxytocin affects the connectivity of the precuneus and the amygdala : a randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled neuroimaging trial .

25526597|OBJECTIVE : In alcohol-dependent patients , alcohol cues evoke increased activation in mesolimbic brain areas , such as the nucleus accumbens and the amygdala .
25526597|RESULTS : Before training , alcohol cue-evoked activation was observed in the amygdala bilaterally , as well as in the right nucleus accumbens , although here it fell short of significance .
25526597|Activation in the amygdala correlated with craving and arousal ratings of alcohol stimuli ; correlations in the nucleus accumbens again fell short of significance .
25526597|After training , the bias modification group showed greater reductions in cue-evoked activation in the amygdala bilaterally and in behavioral arousal ratings of alcohol pictures , compared with the sham training group .
25526597|Decreases in right amygdala activity correlated with decreases in craving in the bias modification but not the sham training group .
25530842|Aberrant amygdala functional connectivity at rest in pediatric anxiety disorders .
25530842|Recent work suggests that generalized anxiety disorder -LRB- GAD -RRB- is characterized by dysfunctional connectivity in amygdala-based circuits at rest in adolescents , consistent with adults .
25530842|The current study examines amygdala functional connectivity at rest in children and adolescents across comorbid anxiety disorders -LRB- ADs -RRB- including youth with primary diagnoses of GAD and social phobia -LRB- SP -RRB- .
25530842|RESULTS : Compared with healthy controls -LRB- HCs -RRB- , AD youth exhibited hyperconnectivity between the right amygdala and the insula and hypoconnectivity between the left amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- and posterior cingulate cortex -LRB- PCC -RRB- .
25530842|Within the AD group , connectivity was not correlated with anxiety severity and only the amygdala-PCC connectivity was positively correlated with age .
25530842|This extends upon previous work suggesting alterations in amygdala circuits underlying fear learning , emotion regulation , and the processing of interoceptive states .
25533294|RESULTS : We found that MD in MS was associated with increased local path length in the right hippocampus and right amygdala .
25533294|Further analyses revealed that these effects were driven by an increased shortest distance between both the right hippocampus and right amygdala and a series of regions including the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex , orbitofrontal cortex , sensory-motor cortices and supplementary motor area .
25533872|RESULTS : Significant reductions in brain activity following treatment with naproxen , compared to placebo , were observed in brain regions commonly associated with pain perception , including the bilateral primary somatosensory cortex , thalamus , and amygdala .
25535788|Compared with right-handers , significant alterations in nodal efficiency were revealed in left-handers , involving the anterior and median cingulate gyrus , middle temporal gyrus , angular gyrus , and amygdala .
25540682|Resting state amygdala-prefrontal connectivity predicts symptom change after cognitive behavioral therapy in generalized social anxiety disorder .
25540682|BACKGROUND : Aberrant amygdala-prefrontal interactions at rest and during emotion processing are implicated in the pathophysiology of generalized social anxiety disorder -LRB- gSAD -RRB- , a common disorder characterized by fears of potential scrutiny .
25540682|To date , predictors of success in CBT for gSAD include reduced amygdala reactivity and increased activity in prefrontal regulatory regions -LRB- e.g. , anterior cingulate cortex , `` ACC '' -RRB- during emotion processing .
25540682|However , studies have not examined whether tonic -LRB- i.e. , at rest -RRB- coupling of amygdala and these prefrontal regions also predict response to CBT .
25540682|Whole-brain voxel-wise findings showed symptom improvement after CBT was predicted by greater right amygdala-pregenual ACC -LRB- `` pgACC '' -RRB- connectivity and greater left amygdala-pgACC coupling encompassing medial prefrontal cortex .
25540682|In support of their predictive value , area under receiver operating characteristic curve was significant for the left and right amygdala-pgACC in relation to treatment responders .
25540682|CONCLUSIONS : Improvement after CBT was predicted by enhanced resting-state bilateral amygdala-prefrontal coupling in gSAD .
25545969|Abnormal functional connectivity of the amygdala is associated with depression in Parkinson 's disease .
25545969|Abnormal functional connectivity of the amygdala with various cortical and subcortical areas has been observed in major depressive disorder , indicating that dysfunction of the corticolimbic network may be involved in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder .
25545969|However , little is known about alterations of amygdala functional connectivity in depressed PD patients .
25545969|Between-group differences in amygdala functional connectivity network were examined using t tests .
25545969|Compared to the nondepressed PD patients , depressed PD patients showed increased left amygdala functional connectivity with the bilateral mediodorsal thalamus , right amygdala functional connectivity with the left superior temporal gyrus , and left calcarine gyrus .
25545969|Compared to the healthy controls , the depressed PD group also showed increased left amygdala functional connectivity with the bilateral mediodorsal thalamus , but decreased left amygdala functional connectivity with the left putamen , left inferior frontal gyrus , and the right cerebellum , as well as decreased right amygdala functional connectivity with the left inferior orbitofrontal gyrus , the left gyrus rectus , and the right putamen .
25552571|Connectivity between amygdala and right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex was especially pronounced during cross-task interference from affective features .
25557777|Atypical amygdala function and connectivity have reliably been associated with psychopathy .
25557777|However , the amygdala is not a unitary structure .
25557777|To examine how psychopathic traits in a nonforensic sample are linked to amygdala response to violence , this study used probabilistic tractography to classify amygdala subnuclei based on anatomical projections to and from amygdala subnuclei in a group of 43 male participants .
25557777|While a full amygdala seed showed significant connectivity only to right middle occipital gyrus , subnuclei seeds revealed unique connectivity patterns .
25557777|Such an approach yields a better understanding of amygdala dysfunction in psychopathy .
25563749|Furthermore , OXTR methylation was investigated regarding SAD-related traits -LRB- Social Phobia Scale -LRB- SPS -RRB- and Social Interaction Anxiety Scale -LRB- SIAS -RRB- -RRB- , salivary cortisol response during the Trier social stress test -LRB- TSST -RRB- , and amygdala responsiveness to social phobia related verbal stimuli using fMRI .
25563749|Significantly decreased OXTR methylation particularly at CpG Chr3 : 8 809 437 was associated with -LRB- 1 -RRB- the categorical phenotype of SAD -LRB- p < 0.001 , Cohen 's d = 0.535 -RRB- , -LRB- 2 -RRB- increased SPS and SIAS scores -LRB- p < 0.001 -RRB- , -LRB- 3 -RRB- increased cortisol response to the TSST -LRB- p = 0.02 -RRB- , and -LRB- 4 -RRB- increased amygdala responsiveness during social phobia-related word processing -LRB- right : p -LRB- corr -RRB- < 0.001 ; left : p -LRB- corr -RRB- = 0.005 -RRB- .
25564288|RESULTS : We found that labels rated high on emotional reaction were better remembered , associated with reduction in the urge to smoke , and produced greater brain response in the amygdala , hippocampi , inferior frontal gyri and the insulae .
25564288|CONCLUSIONS : Recognition memory and craving are , respectively , correlates of effectiveness of addiction-related public health communications and interventions , and amygdala activation facilitates the encoding of emotional memories .
25569763|vmPFC interacts with a number of subcortical structures involved in affective processing , including the amygdala , hypothalamus , periaqueductal gray , ventral striatum , and bed nucleus of stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- .
25569763|No such perfusion differences were observed for the amygdala , striatum , hypothalamus , or periaqueductal gray .
25572160|Unilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy -LRB- MTLE -RRB- has been associated with reduced amygdala responsiveness to fearful faces .
25572160|However , the effect of unilateral MTLE on empathy-related brain responses in extra-amygdalar regions has not been investigated .
25572160|The primary finding was that right MTLE -LRB- RMTLE -RRB- was associated with decreased activity predominantly in the right amygdala and also in bilateral periaqueductal gray -LRB- PAG -RRB- but normal activity in the right anterior insula .
25572160|The results of the extra-MTLE group demonstrate that these reduced amygdala and PAG responses go beyond the attenuation caused by antiepileptic and antidepressant medication .
25573399|RESULTS : Greater differential right amygdala activation to matching fearful v. happy facial expressions related to greater negative affectivity -LRB- i.e. trait anxiety -RRB- and was heightened across all anxiety disorder groups compared with controls .

25580566|RESULTS : Relative to controls , larger left amygdala volumes were found in the Epilepsy with Anxiety group compared to the Epilepsy without Anxiety group -LRB- p = 0.027 -RRB- .
25580566|SIGNIFICANCE : Anxiety is a common psychiatric comorbidity in children with recent-onset epilepsy with volumetric enlargement of the amygdala and thinner cortex in orbital and other regions of prefrontal cortex , suggesting structural abnormalities in brain regions that are part of the dysfunctional networks reported in individuals with anxiety disorders in the general population .
25581710|Early-life stress induces anxiety-like behaviors and activity imbalances in the medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala in adult rats .
25581710|Emotional regulation requires the inhibitory influence of the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- on amygdalar activity , and dysfunction of this system is believed to induce anxiety .
25581710|Because mPFC and amygdala have dense reciprocal connections and projections between them continue to develop until adolescence , early-life stress may impair the function of this circuit and cause emotional dysregulation .
25581710|We examined the effects of stress during circuit development on anxiety-like behaviors , neural activities in the mPFC and amygdala , and impulse transmission in the mPFC-amygdala circuit in adult rats .
25581710|In the open-field test , stress altered Fos expression in the mPFC and amygdala .
25581710|Compared to non-stressed rats , which were exposed to neither unpredictable stress nor early weaning , stressed rats exhibited decreased Fos expression in the right superficial layers of the infralimbic cortex and increased Fos expression in the right basolateral amygdala and both sides of the central amygdala .
25581710|Electrophysiological analysis revealed that excitatory latencies of mPFC neurons to amygdalar stimulation in stressed rats were significantly longer than control rats in the right , but not left , hemisphere .
25581710|Stress had no effect on excitatory latencies of amygdalar neurons to mPFC stimulation in the mPFC-amygdala circuits in the both hemisphere .
25581710|These data suggest that early-life stress impairs the mPFC-amygdala circuit development , resulting in imbalanced mPFC and amygdala activities and anxiety-like behaviors .
25582522|Increased brain response to appetitive tastes in the insula and amygdala in obese compared with healthy weight children when sated .
25582522|RESULTS : A region of interest analysis revealed an elevated BOLD response to taste -LRB- sucrose and water -RRB- within the bilateral insula and amygdala in OB children relative to HW children .
25582522|Whole-brain analyses revealed a group by condition interaction within the paracingulate , medial frontal , middle frontal gyri and right amygdala : post hoc analyses suggested an increased response to sucrose for OB relative to HW children , whereas HW children responded more strongly to water relative to sucrose .
25582522|CONCLUSION : This study showed increased reactivity in the amygdala and insula in the OB compared with HW children , but no functional differentiation in the striatum , despite differences in the striatum previously seen in older samples .

25600111|In patients treated with L-T4 , we found a significant decrease in regional activity at P < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction in the left thalamus , right amygdala , right hippocampus , left ventral striatum and the right dorsal striatum .
25600111|Placebo treatment was associated with a significant decrease in activity only in the right amygdala , and no region had a change in activity that was correlated with change in depression scores .
25600157|Depressive symptoms in Parkinson 's disease are related to decreased hippocampus and amygdala volume .

25605886|Asymmetrical effects of unilateral right or left amygdala damage on auditory cortical processing of vocal emotions .
25605886|-LRB- 5 -RRB- Neuroscience of Emotion and Affective Dynamics Laboratory , Department of Psychology , University of Geneva , 1205 Geneva , Switzerland ; Swiss Center for Affective Sciences , University of Geneva , 1211 Geneva , Switzerland ; We tested whether human amygdala lesions impair vocal processing in intact cortical networks .
25605886|In two functional MRI experiments , patients with unilateral amygdala resection either listened to voices and nonvocal sounds or heard binaural vocalizations with attention directed toward or away from emotional information on one side .
25605886|In experiment 2 , emotional voices evoked increased activity in both the auditory cortex and the intact amygdala for right-damaged patients , whereas no such effects were found for left-damaged amygdala patients .
25605886|Furthermore , the left inferior frontal cortex was functionally connected with the intact amygdala in right-damaged patients , but only with homologous right frontal areas and not with the amygdala in left-damaged patients .
25605886|Thus , unilateral amygdala damage leads to globally reduced ipsilesional cortical voice processing , but only left amygdala lesions are sufficient to suppress the enhanced auditory cortical processing of vocal emotions .
25610763|BACKGROUND : Recent neuroimaging work suggests that increased amygdala responses to emotional stimuli and dysfunction within regions mediating top down attentional control -LRB- dorsomedial frontal , lateral frontal and parietal cortices -RRB- may be associated with the emergence of anxiety disorders , including posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- .
25610763|This report examines amygdala responsiveness to emotional stimuli and the recruitment of top down attention systems as a function of task demands in a population of U.S. military service members who had recently returned from combat deployment in Afghanistan/Iraq .
25610763|RESULTS : Greater PTSD symptom severity scores were associated with increased amygdala activation to emotional , particularly positive , stimuli relative to neutral stimuli .
25610763|In addition , greater PTSD symptom severity scores were associated with : -LRB- i -RRB- increased activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal , lateral frontal , inferior parietal cortices and dorsomedial frontal cortex/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- dmFC/dACC -RRB- in response to emotional relative to neutral stimuli ; and -LRB- ii -RRB- increased functional connectivity during emotional trials , particularly positive trials , relative to neutral trials between the right amygdala and dmFC/dACC , left caudate/anterior insula cortex , right lentiform nucleus/caudate , bilateral inferior parietal cortex and left middle temporal cortex .
25610763|First , these data indicate increased emotional responsiveness by : -LRB- i -RRB- the positive relationship between PTSD symptom severity and amygdala responsiveness to emotional relative to neutral stimuli ; -LRB- ii -RRB- greater BOLD response as a function of PTSD symptom severity in regions implicated in emotion -LRB- striatum -RRB- and representation -LRB- occipital and temporal cortices -RRB- during emotional relative to neutral conditions ; and -LRB- iii -RRB- increased connectivity between the amygdala and regions implicated in emotion -LRB- insula/caudate -RRB- and representation -LRB- middle temporal cortex -RRB- as a function of PTSD symptom severity during emotional relative to neutral trials .
25610763|Second , these data indicate a greater need for the recruitment of regions implicated in top down attention as indicated by -LRB- i -RRB- greater BOLD response in superior/middle frontal gyrus as a function of PTSD symptom severity in task relative to view conditions ; -LRB- ii -RRB- greater BOLD response in dmFC/dACC , lateral frontal and inferior parietal cortices as a function of PTSD symptom severity in emotional relative to neutral conditions and -LRB- iii -RRB- greater functional connectivity between the amygdala and inferior parietal cortex as a function of PTSD symptom severity during emotional relative to neutral conditions .
25610767|Conclusions about the relative hyper - or hypo-activation of the amygdala depended on the nature of the contrast that was used to define the activation .
25610787|The present findings did not replicate previous findings of reduced gray matter volumes in the anterior insula , amygdala , and frontal cortex in youth with CD , but are consistent with previous findings of reduced gray matter volumes in temporal regions , particularly in girls .
25616454|The volumetric measurements were focused on the hippocampus and its surrounding structures , including the amygdala , the parahippocampal gyrus , the entorhinal cortex and the perirhinal cortex .
25616672|The fMRI analysis revealed a significant variation of the blood oxygen level dependent signal triggered by the Valsalva manoeuvre in specific areas of the brain involved in the cortical control of the autonomic system and significant differences in the pattern of activation of the insular cortex , amygdala and the right hippocampus between patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and controls , even though these regions did not present significant volumetric changes .
25622022|Moreover , in the patient group , the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- and subcortical regions , including the bilateral brainstem , cerebellum , putamen , right caudate nucleus , and amygdala , exhibited decreased FC with the ipsilateral thalamus -LRB- p < 0.05 , AlphaSim corrected , cluster size > 44 -RRB- but not with the contralateral thalamus -LRB- p < 0.05 , AlphaSim corrected , cluster size > 43 -RRB- .
25629899|Asymmetric engagement of amygdala and its gamma connectivity in early emotional face processing .
25629899|The amygdala has been regarded as a key substrate for emotion processing .
25629899|However , the engagement of the left and right amygdala during the early perceptual processing of different emotional faces remains unclear .
25629899|We investigated the temporal profiles of oscillatory gamma activity in the amygdala and effective connectivity of the amygdala with the thalamus and cortical areas during implicit emotion-perceptual tasks using event-related magnetoencephalography -LRB- MEG -RRB- .
25629899|We found that within 100 ms after stimulus onset the right amygdala habituated to emotional faces rapidly -LRB- with duration around 20-30 ms -RRB- , whereas activity in the left amygdala -LRB- with duration around 50-60 ms -RRB- sustained longer than that in the right .
25629899|Our data suggest that the right amygdala could be linked to autonomic arousal generated by facial emotions and the left amygdala might be involved in decoding or evaluating expressive faces in the early perceptual emotion processing .
25629899|The results of effective connectivity provide evidence that only negative emotional processing engages both cortical and subcortical pathways connected to the right amygdala , representing its evolutional significance -LRB- survival -RRB- .
25629899|These findings demonstrate the asymmetric engagement of bilateral amygdala in emotional face processing as well as the capability of MEG for assessing thalamo-cortico-limbic circuitry .
25638352|To address this question we tested PS , a pure case of acquired prosopagnosia with bilateral occipitotemporal lesions anatomically sparing the regions that are assumed to contribute to facial expression -LRB- de -RRB- coding -LRB- i.e. , the amygdala , the insula and the posterior superior temporal sulcus -- pSTS -RRB- .
25640836|There were significantly more cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites where methylation levels covaried with right amygdala volume among Met/Met compared with both Met/Val and Val/Val carriers .
25640836|Thus , antenatal Maternal Anxiety  BDNF Val66Met Polymorphism interactions at the level of the epigenome are reflected differently in the structure of the amygdala and the hippocampus .
25642179|Cognitively demanding conditions were associated with greater activation of right medial frontal and insula regions while bilateral amygdala was more significantly altered during emotion -LRB- cognitively undemanding -RRB- conditions ; consistent with task demands .
25642179|Overlap was present in left amygdala and right subcallosal cingulate between emotion and resting meta-analyses , with no significant divergence .
25647754|A region of interest analysis indicated that oxytocin caused small but significant decreases in left -LRB- -0.045 % , 95 % CI = -0.087 to -0.003 , t = -2.19 , p = .037 -RRB- and right -LRB- -0.051 % , 95 % CI = -0.088 to -0.014 -RSB- , t = -2.82 , p = .008 -RRB- amygdala activity across all temperatures .
25647754|CONCLUSIONS : The present study provides evidence for a significant but subtle inhibitory effect of oxytocin on thermal stimulus ratings and concurrent amygdala activity .
25649923|In patients with ICDs , we found significant cortical thinning in fronto-striatal circuitry , specifically in the right superior orbitofrontal , left rostral middle frontal , bilateral caudal middle frontal region , and corpus callosum , as well as volume reduction in the right accumbens and increase in the left amygdala .
25658577|Using normative references from 20 female age - and education-matched healthy control peers , CL showed significantly reduced temporal cortex thickness with reduced bilateral hippocampal , right amygdala , and right caudate volumes .
25659234|Increased activation of the right amygdala and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex following errors was observed in patients with OCD .
25659234|CONCLUSIONS : Higher error-related activity was found in the amygdala and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex , suggesting a stronger affective response toward errors in patients with OCD .
25665398|-LSB- Behavior of high - and low-anxiety rats after modulation of GABAergic transmission in basolateral amygdala -RSB- .
25665398|The influence of GABA -LRB- A -RRB- receptor agonist -LRB- muscimol hydrobromide , 0.1 ?g / 0.5 ?L -RRB- and antagonist -LRB- bicuculline methiodide , 0.2 ?g / 0.5 ?L -RRB- injections into the right and the left basolateral amygdala on the behavior of the high - and low-anxiety rats was investigated in elevated plus-maze test .
25665398|More powerful changes in behavior of rats were revealed after injections of muscimol into the left amygdala of high-anxiety rats and bicuculline into the right amygdala of low-anxiety ones .
25665398|The results evidence the existence of individual typological and interhemispheric differences in functioning of the amygdalar GABAergic system .
2566649|Previously reported high concentrations of dopamine in left amygdala were strongly associated with low concentrations of D - -LSB- 3H -RSB- aspartate binding in left polar temporal cortex in the schizophrenics .
2566649|The results also suggest that schizophrenia may involve left-sided abnormalities in the relationship between temporal glutamatergic and dopaminergic projections to amygdala .
25668330|Craving is associated with amygdala volumes in adolescent marijuana users during abstinence .
25668330|OBJECTIVES : The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between amygdala volume and craving during 28 days of abstinence in adolescent MJ users .
25668330|Left and right amygdala volumes were traced by hand -LRB- ICC > 0.86 -RRB- .
25668330|RESULTS : Results revealed that greater craving during abstinence was significantly associated with smaller left and right amygdala volumes , after controlling for age and gender .
25668330|Other measures of withdrawal , including mood , somatic complaints and sleep problems , were not related to amygdala morphometry .
25668330|CONCLUSION : These results are consistent with previous findings in adult alcohol - and cocaine-dependent individuals , who demonstrated a relationship between reduced amygdala volumes and increased craving .
25670944|Specifically , ASD children exhibited less activation in the right amygdala -LRB- AMY -RRB- , right superior temporal sulcus -LRB- STS -RRB- and right inferior frontal gyrus -LRB- IFG -RRB- than TDC group when fearful faces were shown .
25673008|Abnormal functional connectivity of the amygdala-based network in resting-state FMRI in adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder .
25673008|BACKGROUND : We aimed to investigate the disruptions of functional connectivity of amygdala-based networks in adolescents with untreated generalized anxiety disorder -LRB- GAD -RRB- .
25673008|We analyzed the correlation of fMRI signal fluctuation between the amygdala and other brain regions .
25673008|The variation of amygdala-based functional connectivity and its correlation with anxiety severity were investigated .
25673008|RESULTS : Decreased functional connectivity was found between the left amygdala and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex .
25673008|An increased right amygdala functional connectivity with right posterior and anterior lobes of the cerebellum , insula , superior temporal gyrus , putamen , and right amygdala were found in our study .
25673008|Negative correlations between GAD scores and functional connectivity of the right amygdala with the cerebellum were also observed in the GAD adolescents .
25700742|The role of the amygdala during emotional processing in Huntington 's disease : from pre-manifest to late stage disease .
25700742|On the basis of the results of this initial study went on to look at amygdala dependent cognitive performance in 79 Huntington 's disease patients from a cross-section of disease stages -LRB- pre-manifest to late disease -RRB- and 26 healthy controls , using a validated theory of mind task : `` the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test '' which has been previously been shown to be amygdala dependent .
25700742|RESULTS : Psychophysiological interaction analysis identified reduced connectivity between the left amygdala and right fusiform facial area in pre-manifest HD gene carriers compared to controls when viewing angry compared to neutral faces .
25700742|Connectivity between the amygdala and other brain regions is impacted by the disease process in pre-manifest HD and may therefore be a useful way of identifying participants who are approaching a clinical diagnosis .
25700742|Furthermore , the `` Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test '' is a surrogate measure of amygdala function that is clinically useful across the entire cross-section of disease stages in HD .
25703807|We also investigated the role of the amygdala , the key region for social interaction and emotion recognition .
25703807|Two spherical regions of interest -LRB- ROIs -RRB- in the amygdala were set to extract BOLD responses during happy and fearful facial expression .
25703807|Psychophysiological interaction -LRB- PPI -RRB- for the left and right amygdala during happy and fearful facial expression was conducted using the amygdala as seed regions .
25703807|The FR group also showed a statistically significant linear correlation between mean amygdala BOLD response and facial expression recognition .
25703807|PPI showed that there was a significant negative interaction between the amygdala and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- dlPFC -RRB- and superior temporal gyrus in FR subjects .
25703807|Abnormal PFC function in FR was also suggested by PPI , as the dlPFC showed decreased functional connectivity with the amygdala in the FR group .
25703807|This may indicate that in FR subjects the amygdala have to take a greater role in emotion recognition and social functioning .
25703807|This inference was supported by our discovery of statistically significant correlations between the amygdala BOLD response and emotion recognition in the FR group but not in controls .
25713527|Emotional discrimination during viewing unpleasant pictures : timing in human anterior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and amygdala .
25713527|The ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- VLPFC -RRB- and amygdala have critical roles in the generation and regulation of unpleasant emotions , and in this study the dynamic neural basis of unpleasant emotion processing was elucidated by using paired-samples permutation t-tests to identify the timing of emotional discrimination in various brain regions .
25713527|Results show that emotional discrimination in the right amygdala precedes that in the left amygdala and that emotional discrimination in both those regions precedes that in the right anterior VLPFC .
25713527|They support the hypotheses that the right amygdala is part of a rapid emotional stimulus detection system and the left amygdala is specialized for sustained stimulus evaluation and that the right anterior VLPFC is implicated in the integration of viscerosensory information with affective signals between the bilateral anterior VLPFCs and the bilateral amygdalae .
25716297|These studies established a predominant role for the amygdala in fear acquisition , while the ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- has been shown to be important in the extinction of conditioned fear .
25716297|The objective of the present study was to investigate if interindividual differences in morphology of the amygdala and the vmPFC are related to differences in fear acquisition and extinction learning in humans .
25716297|Stronger acquisition of fear as indexed by skin conductance responses was associated with larger right amygdala volume , while the degree of extinction learning was positively correlated with cortical thickness of the right vmPFC .
25716841|We show not only that right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- activity is correlated with intention-based economic decisions and that ventral striatum and amygdala activity are correlated with outcome-based decisions , but also that stimulation to the DLPFC selectively enhances intention-based decisions .
25735116|-LSB- On the right side of the amygdala salivary glands ectopic case report -RSB- .
25735885|This systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis explore volumetric differences of three key structural brain regions -LRB- hippocampus , amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- -RRB- , all of which have been implicated in dysfunction of both salience network -LRB- SN -RRB- and default mode network -LRB- DMN -RRB- in PTSD sufferers .
25735885|Fifty-nine volumetric analyses from 44 articles were examined and included -LRB- 36 hippocampus , 14 amygdala and nine ACC -RRB- with n = 846 PTSD participants , n = 520 healthy controls -LRB- HCs -RRB- and n = 624 traumatised controls -LRB- TCs -RRB- .
25735885|A medium effect size reduction was found in bilateral amygdala volume when compared with findings in healthy controls ; however , no significant differences in amygdala volume between PTSD subjects and trauma-exposed controls were found .
25736554|We found a significant association -LRB- FDR correction , q < 0.05 -RRB- between lesions in the right insular , right frontal and right parietal cortex as well as the right amygdala , basal ganglia and thalamus and the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias .
25759286|We collected 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging data from the caudate , pallidum , putamen , nucleus accumbens , hippocampus , amygdala , ventral diencephalon , and thalamus .
25765015|CSD of the neuroticism group was significantly higher than that of the control group in the full band at the amygdala and inferior temporal gyrus , and in the ? band at the right temporal lobe -LRB- p < 0.05 -RRB- .
25765693|Several studies have shown that epileptic activity , especially mediated through the amygdala , alters reproductive function , including reduced ovarian cyclicity in females and altered sex steroid hormone levels in both genders .
25765693|Furthermore , there is an asymmetric activation of the hypothalamus with unilateral amygdala seizures .
25766598|Morphometry of the amygdala in schizophrenia and psychotic bipolar disorder .
25766598|Volumetric studies suggest smaller amygdalae in subjects with schizophrenia -LRB- SZ -RRB- than with bipolar disorder -LRB- BP -RRB- .
25766598|We use morphometry to identify subregions of amygdala differentially affected in SZ and psychotic BP .
25766598|Based on template centered population analysis , the shape of the amygdala in psychotic BP differs from SZ -LRB- pleft = 0.044 , pright = 0.042 -RRB- .
25766598|These results suggest that change in shape of amygdala may represent a morphologic feature distinguishing SZ from psychotic BP .
25771686|RESULTS : During the presence of emotional distracters , subjects with bipolar I disorder showed slowed reaction times to targets , and increased blood oxygenation level-dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- responses in the amygdala , accumbens , and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , but not increased inverse functional connectivity between these prefrontal and subcortical areas , and altered white matter microstructure organization in the right uncinate fasciculus .
25771686|Subjects with bipolar II disorder showed no altered reaction times , increased BOLD responses in the same brain areas , increased inverse functional connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and amygdala , and no abnormalities in white matter organization .
25776219|In addition , our analysis revealed that the anterior subregion was functionally connected to the ventral striatum , midbrain and amygdala , a circuit that is central to models of stress and motivated behavior .
25777814|Negative symptoms in schizophrenia show association with amygdala volumes and neural activation during affective processing .
25777814|OBJECTIVES : Negative symptoms in schizophrenia have been associated with structural and functional alterations of the amygdala .
25777814|We hypothesised that there would be between-group differences in amygdala volume and neural activation patterns during processing of affective stimuli among patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls .
25777814|METHODS : We used structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess volume and neural activation of the amygdala in 28 patients with schizophrenia and 28 healthy controls .
25777814|RESULTS : We found no between-group differences in amygdala volume or neural activation .
25777814|However , we found a significant negative correlation between emotional blunting and neural activation in the left amygdala during processing of positive affect .
25777814|We also found a significant negative correlation between stereotyped thinking and the volume of right amygdala .
25777814|CONCLUSION : Our findings implicate the amygdala in a subgroup of negative symptoms in schizophrenia that are characterised by reduced expression with blunted affect and stereotyped thinking .
25785510|OBJECTIVE : To examine the categorical and dimensional relationships of PS symptoms to prefrontal hypoactivation during working memory and to amygdala hyperactivation during threat emotion processing .
25785510|MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES : Two functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigms were used : a fractal n-back working memory task probing executive system function and an emotion identification task probing amygdala responses to threatening faces .
25785510|During emotion identification , PS demonstrated elevated responses to threatening facial expressions in amygdala , as well as left fusiform cortex and right middle frontal gyrus -LRB- cluster-corrected P < .05 -RRB- .
25785510|The response in the amygdala correlated with positive symptom severity -LRB- r = .16 , P = .01 -RRB- but not with cognitive deficits .
25791179|Off-label intranasal oxytocin use in adults is associated with increased amygdala-cingulate resting-state connectivity .
25791179|However , individuals with oxytocin misuse showed an increased connectivity between the right amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex relative to the control group .
25791179|Higher estimated cumulative doses of oxytocin were associated with enhanced amygdala-cingulate connectivity .
25791179|These results show that individuals who have self-selected for and pursued oxytocin use have increased amygdala-cingulate resting connectivity , compared to individuals who have not used oxytocin , despite the lack of differences in RMET and NIH-ASRS scores .
25798822|Goal intentions were also associated with less effective modulation of left amygdala , supporting the increased efficacy of ER under implementation intention instructions , which showed coupling of orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala .
25801924|Linear regression analyses were used to examine associations between aggression and amygdala and hippocampal volume .
25801924|RESULTS : Aggressive behavior was associated with smaller amygdala -LRB- p < .05 -RRB- but not hippocampal volume .
25801924|CONCLUSION : We found novel evidence that childhood aggressive behavior is related to decreased amygdala volume , decreased sensorimotor cortical thickness , and decreased global right hemisphere gyrification .
25802501|Investigation with neuroimaging revealed an intrinsic lesion in the right amygdala , with features suggestive of low-grade neoplasia .
25803882|The target volume of interest -LRB- VOI -RRB- included the entire region of the entorhinal cortex , hippocampus , and amygdala .
25809287|Lithium treatment and hippocampal subfields and amygdala volumes in bipolar disorder .
25809287|OBJECTIVES : Results from magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- studies are heterogeneous with regard to hippocampal and amygdala volume alterations in bipolar disorder -LRB- BD -RRB- .
25809287|Hippocampal total and subfield volumes and amygdala volumes were automatically estimated using Freesurfer .
25809287|RESULTS : The Non-Li BD group displayed significantly smaller bilateral cornu ammonis -LRB- CA -RRB- 2/3 and CA4/dentate gyrus -LRB- DG -RRB- subfields , total hippocampal volumes , right CA1 and right subiculum subfields , and left amygdala volume compared to healthy controls .
25809287|There were positive associations between lithium treatment duration and left amygdala volume .
25809287|CONCLUSIONS : Hippocampal subfield and amygdala volumes were reduced in Non-Li BD patients compared to healthy controls , whereas the Li + BD volumes were no different from those in Non-Li BD patients or healthy controls .
25809287|Over the course of BD , lithium treatment might counteract reductions specifically in the left CA1 and CA2/3 hippocampal subfields and amygdala volumes , in accordance with the suggested neuroprotective effects of lithium .
25809952|RESULTS : Referring to the entire LE group , VBM revealed bi-amygdalar GM volume increase in the early disease stage .
25809952|In the chronic disease stage , amygdala enlargement had resolved and we found GM volume reduction in the right cerebellar hemisphere .
25809952|In the subgroup analysis , VBM showed corresponding bi-amygdalar GM volume increase in VGKC-complex-associated LE on early MRI , whereas no changes were found in GAD-associated LE .
25809952|SIGNIFICANCE : The present study provides further evidence of a predominant affection of the amygdala in the early disease stage of LE , which resolves during the later course of the disease .
25810522|Neurally , the left amygdala/hippocampus was activated in the conditions with blameworthy intention -LRB- i.e. , intentional harm and failed attempt -RRB- .
25810522|Effective connectivity analysis revealed that in the unintentional conditions -LRB- i.e. , accidental and failed attempt -RRB- the IFG received input from the TPJ and AI , and sent regulatory signals to the amygdala .
25815418|OBJECTIVE : The amygdala 's role in threat perception suggests that increased activation of this region may be related to paranoid ideation .
25815418|However , investigations of amygdala function in paranoid individuals with schizophrenia , compared with both healthy individuals and nonparanoid individuals with schizophrenia , have consistently reported reduced task-related activation .
25815418|The present study tested for differences in baseline levels of amygdala activity in paranoid and nonparanoid individuals with schizophrenia using arterial spin labeling perfusion MRI .
25815418|METHOD : Resting cerebral blood flow -LRB- CBF -RRB- and task-related activation of the amygdala were measured in 25 healthy individuals , 16 individuals with schizophrenia who were actively paranoid at the time of scanning , and 16 individuals with schizophrenia who were not paranoid .
25815418|RESULTS : Analysis of relative CBF values extracted from the amygdala bilaterally revealed significantly increased activity in the left amygdala in paranoid patient volunteers compared with healthy comparison subjects and nonparanoid patient volunteers .
25815418|Increased CBF was also evident in the right amygdala but did not reach the level of statistical significance .
25815418|Paranoid volunteers also showed significantly decreased task-related activation of the amygdala compared with the two other groups .
25815418|CONCLUSIONS : These findings suggest that amygdala hyperactivation may underlie paranoia in schizophrenia .
25816069|RESULTS : Compared with the TD participants , the CD participants showed lower ALFF in the bilateral amygdala/parahippocampus , right lingual gyrus , left cuneus and right insula .
25823855|In temporal lobe epilepsy , the laterality of amygdala activation was shifted to the side contralateral to the seizure focus , whereas controls showed no significant asymmetry .
25827506|AMIC also showed greater functional connectivity with right fusiform gyrus , left middle frontal gyrus , and right amygdala/parahippocampal gyrus in the MDD compared to HCL group .
25835522|The posterior Superior Temporal Suclus -LRB- pSTS -RRB- represents a central hub in the complex cerebral network for person perception and emotion recognition as also suggested by its heavy connections with face - and body-specific cortical -LRB- e.g. , the fusiform face area , FFA and the extrastriate body area , EBA -RRB- and subcortical structures -LRB- e.g. , amygdala -RRB- .
25835522|We speculate that the opposite role of the right pSTS for conscious perception of fearful face and body may be explained by the different connections that this region entertains with face - and body-selective visual areas as well as with amygdalae and premotor regions .
25841890|Effects of fluoxetine on the amygdala and the hippocampus after administration of a single prolonged stress to male Wistar rates : In vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy findings .
25841890|The hippocampus and amygdala are key areas in mood regulation .
25841890|However , little work has directly examined the effects of fluoxetine on the hippocampus and the amygdala .
25841890|In vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy -LRB- -LRB- 1 -RRB- H-MRS -RRB- was performed -1 , 1 , 4 , 7 and 14 days after SPS to examine the effects of fluoxetine on neurometabolite changes in amygdala , hippocampus and thalamus .
25841890|SPS increased the N-acetylaspartate -LRB- NAA -RRB- / creatine -LRB- Cr -RRB- and choline moieties -LRB- Cho -RRB- / Cr ratios in the bilateral amygdala on day 4 , decreased the NAA/Cr ratio in the left hippocampus on day 1 , and increased both ratios in the right hippocampus on day 14 .
25841890|Fluoxetine treatment corrected the SPS increases in the NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr levels in the amygdala on day 4 and in the hippocampus on day 14 , but it failed to normalise SPS-associated decreases in NAA/Cr levels in the left hippocampus on day 1 .
25841890|These results suggested that metabolic abnormalities in the amygdala and the hippocampus were involved in SPS , and different effects of fluoxetine in correcting SPS-induced neurometabolite changes among the three areas .
25852541|Impaired emotional autobiographical memory associated with right amygdalar-hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer 's disease patients .
25852541|We studied the influence of emotions on autobiographical memory -LRB- AbM -RRB- in patients with Alzheimer 's disease -LRB- AD -RRB- , characteristically triggering atrophy in the hippocampus and the amygdala , two crucial structures sustaining memory and emotional processing .
25852541|Additionally , we sought to determine the relationship of emotional AbM to amygdalar-hippocampal volumes .
25852541|Global scores and rates of emotional memories , but not the specificity scores , were correlated to right amygdalar and hippocampal volumes , indicating that atrophy in these structures has a central role in the deficit observed .
25857684|Groups also differed in activation of the right hippocampus and left amygdala during negative encoding , with a trend for higher activation in non-remitters compared with HCs .
25864953|Hippocampal , amygdala and nucleus accumbens volume in first-episode schizophrenia patients and individuals at high familial risk : A cross-sectional comparison .
25864953|We used Freesurfer to extract volumetric measurements of the hippocampus , amygdala and nucleus accumbens with the aim of assessing whether any alterations found were present in all those at high risk , or selectively in the high risk cohort based on future clinical outcome , or only in those experiencing their first-episode of psychosis .
25864953|However , patients with first-episode schizophrenia demonstrated significant volumetric reductions in the bilateral hippocampus , left amygdala , and right nucleus accumbens compared to high risk individuals and healthy controls , which were not significantly associated with the intake of anti-psychotic medication or duration of illness .
25864953|We found that patients had significantly smaller left amygdalae and bilateral hippocampus compared to HR -LSB- ill -RSB- .
25864953|Our findings suggest that volumetric reductions of the hippocampus , amygdala and nucleus accumbens occur early in the first-episode of psychosis .
25865357|The right amygdala showed increased connectivity with the DMN during subliminal processing in PTSD as compared to controls .
25868002|The amygdala , hippocampus , and medial prefrontal cortex are limbic brain regions connected by the uncinate fasciculus -LRB- UF -RRB- and implicated in emotion regulation .
25870551|Seeing the world through non rose-colored glasses : anxiety and the amygdala response to blended expressions .
25870551|These behavioral findings might reflect anxiety-related biases in stimulus representation within the human amygdala .
25870551|Here , we used functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- together with a continuous adaptation design to investigate the representation of faces from three expression continua -LRB- surprise-fear , sadness-fear , and surprise-sadness -RRB- within the amygdala and other brain regions implicated in face processing .
25870551|fMRI analyses revealed that high trait anxious participants also showed greater representational similarity , as indexed by greater adaptation of the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- signal , between 50/50 surprise/fear expression blends and faces from the fear end of the surprise-fear continuum in both the right amygdala and right fusiform face area -LRB- FFA -RRB- .
25870551|These findings suggest that anxiety-related biases in the processing of expressions intermediate between surprise and fear may be linked to differential representation of these stimuli in the amygdala and FFA .
25872899|We hypothesized aberrant activation dynamics during the period of negative and neutral SRP in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- rACC -RRB- and in the amygdala in patients with major depressive disorder .
25872899|A novel finding was the significant activation of the amygdala and the reward-processing network during presentation of neutral self-referential stimuli relative to baseline and to affective stimuli in patients .
25874749|Viewing the peer compared with parents elicited activation in posterior ` mentalizing ' structures , the precuneus , posterior cingulate cortex -LRB- PCC -RRB- , bilateral posterior superior temporal sulcus and right temporoparietal junction , as well as the ventral striatum and bilateral amygdala and hippocampus .
25878275|Emotion regulation and trait anxiety are predicted by the microstructure of fibers between amygdala and prefrontal cortex .
25878275|Diffusion tensor imaging revealed that trait anxiety predicts the microstructural properties of a prespecified fiber tract between the amygdala and the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex .
25878275|We investigated white matter differences in persons featuring an anxious or a nonanxious personality , taking into account all potential pathway connections between amygdala and anxiety-related regions of the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- .
25878275|With probabilistic tractography , pathways between the amygdala and the dorsolateral PFC , dorsomedial PFC , ventromedial PFC , and orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- were delineated .
25878275|The resulting network showed a direct ventral connection between amygdala and PFC and a second limbic connection following the fornix and the anterior limb of the internal capsule .
25878275|Both are part of a broad fiber tract network between amygdala and PFC. Copyright  2015 the authors 0270-6474/15 / 356020-08 $ 15.00 / 0 .
25879865|The atrophy rates of bilateral entorhinal cortex and amygdala volumes were also associated with time to symptom onset , independent of CR , ApoE genotype , and baseline volume .
25882724|Mood induction and language activation during functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- were used in 20 right-handed and 20 nonright-handed subjects , focusing on interconnected regions known to play critical roles in affective responses : subgenual cingulate cortex , amygdala , and anterior insular cortex .
25882724|In anterior insula , right-handed individuals displayed reciprocal activation of either hemisphere depending upon mood valence , whereas amygdala activation was predominantly left-sided regardless of mood valence .
25884243|Regions of interest were placed at the bilateral hippocampal heads , amygdalas and temporal lobes to get the average regional cerebral blood flow -LRB- rCBF -RRB- and calculate asymmetry indices -LRB- AIs -RRB- .
25884243|RESULTS : AIs of the hippocampus and amygdala in TLE-MTS and AIs of hippocampus in TLE-no were significantly different versus controls -LRB- P < 0.001 , P = 0.001 , and P = 0.013 -RRB- .
25887261|Developmental sex differences in resting state functional connectivity of amygdala sub-regions .
25887261|The amygdala is one brain area that has displayed sexual dimorphism , specifically in socio-affective -LRB- superficial amygdala -LSB- SFA -RSB- -RRB- , stress -LRB- centromedial amygdala -LSB- CMA -RSB- -RRB- , and learning and memory -LRB- basolateral amygdala -LSB- BLA -RSB- -RRB- processing .
25887261|The amygdala has also been implicated in mood and anxiety disorders which display sex-specific features , most prominently observed during adolescence .
25887261|Using functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- , the present study examined the interaction of age and sex on resting state functional connectivity -LRB- RSFC -RRB- of amygdala sub-regions , BLA and SFA , in a sample of healthy adolescents between the ages 10 and 16 years -LRB- n = 122 , 71 boys -RRB- .
25887261|Results indicated that with increasing age , there was a corresponding decrease in RSFC between both amygdala sub-regions and parieto-occipital cortices , with a concurrent increase in RSFC with medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- .
25887261|A dissociation in connectivity between BLA - and SFA-parieto-occipital RSFC emerged , in which girls had weaker negative RSFC between SFA and parieto-occipital regions and boys had weaker negative RSFC of BLA and parieto-occipital regions with increased age , both standing in contrast to adult patterns of amygdala sub-regional RSFC .
25887261|The present findings suggest relative immaturity of amygdala sub-regional RSFC with parieto-occipital cortices during adolescence , with unique patterns in both sexes that may support memory and socio-affective processing in boys and girls , respectively .
25887261|Understanding the underlying normative functional architecture of brain networks associated with the amygdala during adolescence may better inform future research of the neural features associated with increased risk for internalizing psychopathology .
25889278|The medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- , anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , striatum , thalamus , hypothalamus , and amygdala were more active in the CPSP group compared with rats that were not subjected to lateral thalamic hemorrhage .
25889278|The inter-regional correlation analysis showed that regional cerebral blood flow in the mPFC was highly correlated with the amygdala in the right brain , and the right brain showed complex connections among subregions of the ACC .
25889278|Rats with CPSP exhibited strong activation of the thalamocingulate and mPFC-amygdala pathways .
25889278|The mPFC , amygdala , and periaqueductal gray emerged as having important correlations in pain processing in CPSP .
25891925|Voxel-based morphometric analysis revealed significantly larger cortical gray matter volumes of the right precuneus , left orbitofrontal , pars orbitalis , precentral gyri , and bilateral putamen and the amygdala of children with BCECTS compared to healthy controls .
25894493|Asymmetries in subcortical structures included larger LH volumes of thalamus , putamen and globus pallidus and larger RH volumes of the cerebellum and the amygdala .
25895879|RESULTS : The GM volumes in the CD patients were significantly higher in the putamen , pallidum , thalamus , hippocampal cortex , amygdala , precuneus , posterior parietal cortex , periaqueductal grey , and cerebellum , but were lower in many other cortical regions .
25899094|Compared with the PWMLs-CN group , the PWMLs-CI group displayed decreased FA values in the right splenium of the corpus callosum and right posterior cingulum bundle ; lower fALFF values in the left frontal middle gyrus , left precentral gyrus , right angular gyrus and right precuneus ; and higher fALFF values in the right mid cingulum cortex , right hippocampus amygdala , right cerebellar hemisphere and left vermis .
25903464|Areas sensitive to surprisal were left inferior temporal sulcus -LRB- `` visual word form area '' -RRB- , bilateral superior temporal gyrus , right amygdala , bilateral anterior temporal poles , and right inferior frontal sulcus .
25916925|-LSB- Functional connectivity of amygdala in refractory epilepsy : a resting-state functional study of magnetic resonance imaging -RSB- .
25916925|OBJECTIVE : To explore the functions of amygdala functional connectivity in the pathogenesis of refractory epilepsy with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- RS-fMRI -RRB- .
25916925|Then left and right amygdalas were selected as regions of interest -LRB- ROIs -RRB- for calculating the linear correlation between amygdala and whole brain .
25916925|RESULTS : Compared with the controls , left amygdala in refractory epilepsy group showed increased functional connectivity with bilateral fusiform gyrus , bilateral calcarine gyrus and right lingual , on the contrary decreased functional connectivity with bilateral cuneus , bilateral precuneus , bilateral caudatas and left thalamus.However , right amygdala demonstrated increased functional connectivity with bilateral calcarine gyrus and bilateral linguals , but decreased functional connectivity with bilateral caudatas and left putamen -LRB- P < 0.05 -RRB- .
25916925|CONCLUSION : Altered functional connectivity of amygdala reflects its dysfunction in refractory epilepsy patients .
25916925|It suggested that amygdala is an important component of `` epileptic network '' participating in the occurrence and development of refractory epilepsy .
25923684|Recent work with normal participants identified activation related to loss aversion in brain regions including the amygdala , ventral striatum , and ventromedial prefrontal cortex .
25923684|fMRI results revealed that the two groups shared a brain network for value function including right ventral striatum , ventromedial prefrontal cortex , and right amygdala .
25929272|The rats conditioned to self-administer ethanol showed significant increase in the population of NPY-immunoreactive cells and fibres in the AcbSh , central nucleus of amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , hypothalamic arcuate nucleus -LRB- ARC -RRB- and lateral part of bed nucleus of stria terminalis as compared with that in the nave rats .
25935516|Decreased functional connectivity was detected between the seed in the right thalamus and the left superior temporal gyrus -LRB- STG -RRB- , left amygdala , right superior frontal gyrus , left precentral gyrus , and left middle occipital gyrus .
25944965|Social reward feedback was associated with bilateral amygdala and fusiform face area activation .
25944965|During feedback , we observed a negative correlation of AQ and right amygdala activation in men only .
25955025|Rostral and caudal concussions were of striking similarity in the impacted subcortical locations , particularly the central nucleus of the amygdala , laterodorsal thalamus , and hippocampal complex .
25955025|This study presents three significant findings that advance our understanding and evaluation of TBI : 1 -RRB- the introduction of a new method to identify highly localized disturbances in discrete gray matter , subcortical brain nuclei without postmortem histology , 2 -RRB- the use of this method to demonstrate that separate injuries to the rostral and caudal cortex produce the same subcortical , disturbances , and 3 -RRB- the central nucleus of the amygdala , critical in the regulation of emotion , is vulnerable to concussion .
25964498|The amygdala is a key structure for monitoring the relevance of environmental stimuli .
25964498|Here , we examined evoked amygdala responses to gaze and facial emotion changes in five epileptic patients with intracerebral electrodes .
25964498|First , we observed pronounced evoked amygdala potentials to the initial neutral face .
25964498|Second , analysis of the evoked responses to the cue showed an early effect of gaze starting at 123 ms in the right amygdala .
25964498|Our study is the first to demonstrate such an early effect of gaze in the amygdala , in line with its particular behavioral relevance in the spatial attention task .
25964500|Post-traumatic stress and age variation in amygdala volumes among youth exposed to trauma .
25964500|Theoretically , normal developmental variation in amygdala volumes may be altered under conditions of severe stress .
25964500|The purpose of this article was to examine whether posttraumatic stress moderates the association between age and amygdala volumes in youth exposed to traumatic events who are experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- .
25964500|There was a significant group by age interaction in predicting right amygdala volumes .
25964500|A positive association between age and right amygdala volumes was observed , but only in PTSD youth .
25964500|Moreover , older youth with PTSD symptoms had relatively larger right amygdala volumes than controls .
25964500|Findings provide evidence that severe stress may influence age-related variation in amygdala volumes .
25967601|RESULTS : SLE patients with cognitive deficits had significantly smaller volumes in the left hippocampus , amygdala , and the right hippocampus than SLE patients without cognitive deficits .
25971600|Our results showed that , after accounting for variation in total intracranial volume , age and IQ , overall psychopathy was negatively associated with grey matter volume in the left putamen and amygdala .
25971600|Meanness was positively associated with lateral OFC and striatum volume , and negatively associated with amygdala volume .
25971600|Finally , disinhibition was negatively associated with amygdala volume .
25973783|Correlations between amygdala volumes and serum levels of BDNF and NGF as a neurobiological markerin adolescents with bipolar disorder .
25973783|BACKGROUND : The amygdala is repeatedly implicated as a critical component of the neurocircuitry regulating emotional valence .
25973783|Studies have frequently reported reduced amygdala volumes in children and adolescents with bipolar disorder -LRB- BD -RRB- .
25973783|The aim of the present study was to assess amygdala volumesand its correlation with serum levels of NGF and BDNF in euthymic adolescents with BD and healthy controls .
25973783|METHODS : Using structural MRI , we compared the amygdala volumes of 30 euthymic subjects with BD with 23 healthy control subjects aged between 13 and 19 years during a naturalistic clinical follow-up .
25973783|The boundaries of the amygdala were outlined manually .
25973783|RESULTS : The right or left amygdala volume did not differ between the study groups.The right and left amygdala volumes were highly correlated with levels of BDNF in the combined BD group and the valproate-treated group.Both R and L amygdala volumes were correlated with BDNF levels in healthy controls .
25973783|The left amygdala volumes were correlated with BDNF levels in the lithium-treated group .
25973783|CONCLUSIONS : The correlations between amygdala volumes and BDNF levels might be an early neuromarker for diagnosis and/or treatment response in adolescents with BD .
25982857|VBM results indicated that young women with StD showed significantly decreased GMV in the right inferior parietal lobule than NCs ; increased GMV in the amygdala , posterior cingulate cortex , and precuneus ; and increased WMV in the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus .
25986964|Brain volumetric analyses were performed ; resting-state fMRI functional connectivity -LRB- rsFC -RRB- was evaluated using a region-of-interest analysis focused on the amygdala ; and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- dACC -RRB- metabolites were quantified by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy -LRB- MRS -RRB- .
25986964|RESULTS : AAS users had larger right amygdala volumes than nonusers -LRB- P = 0.002 -RRB- and reduced rsFC between right amygdala and frontal , striatal , limbic , hippocampal , and visual cortical areas .
25986964|Left amygdala volumes were slightly larger in AAS users -LRB- P = 0.061 -RRB- but few group differences were detected in left amygdala rsFC .
25986964|CONCLUSIONS : Long-term AAS use is associated with right amygdala enlargement and reduced right amygdala rsFC with brain areas involved in cognitive control and spatial memory , which could contribute to the psychiatric effects and cognitive dysfunction associated with AAS use .
25992711|Increased activity in right amygdala , striatum and brainstem occurred when participants attempted to increase heart rate .
25994970|Our results reveal synchronous activations in left amygdala , left insula and right caudate nucleus that were associated with higher arousal , whereas positive valence ratings correlated with decreases in amygdala and caudate activity .
25994970|Additional analyses showed that synchronous amygdala responses were driven by energy-related features in the music such as root mean square and dissonance , while synchrony in insula was additionally sensitive to acoustic event density .
25999363|Resting-state functional connectivity was measured with amygdala and dorsolateral prefrontal cortical -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- seed regions frequently associated with emotion regulation .
25999363|Across participants , more successful reappraisal correlated with less trait anxiety and more positive daily emotion , greater activation in medial and lateral prefrontal regions , and lesser resting-state functional connectivity between -LRB- a -RRB- right amygdala and both medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices , and -LRB- b -RRB- bilateral DLPFC and posterior visual cortices .
26011391|Activity in the amygdala in response to negative emotion was marginally reduced after exposure to happy primes compared with angry primes .
26017750|Correlation between amygdala volume and impulsivity in adults with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder .
26017750|The amygdala plays an important role in emotion processing and in the activation of the frontal lobe .
26017750|We hypothesised that smaller amygdala volumes in ADHD patients would be associated with less control of impulsivity and emotional instability .
26017750|RESULTS : Significant negative correlation between the right amygdala volume and Barratt 's impulsivity scores was observed -LRB- r = -0.756 , p = 0.018 -RRB- .
26017750|No correlation was found between impulsivity scores and the volume of the left amygdala .
26017750|CONCLUSIONS : Smaller amygdala volumes have been observed in patients with ADHD .
26017750|Our results suggest that greater emotional processing and less control of impulsivity are associated with smaller amygdala volumes in ADHD patients .
26017750|Furthermore , the right amygdala would play a bigger role in impulsivity and behaviour control than the left amygdala .
26032160|Neurally , the right amygdala volume negatively correlated with the negative method factor , while the hippocampal volume positively correlated with the general self-esteem factor in the RSES .
26032160|The amygdala is involved in modulating negative affectivity ; therefore , the current study sheds light on the nature of method effects that are related to self-report with a mix of positively and negatively worded items .
26032924|INTRODUCTION : The paucity of morphometric markers for hemispheric asymmetries and gender variations in hippocampi and amygdalae in temporal lobe epilepsy -LRB- TLE -RRB- calls for better characterization of TLE by finding more useful prognostic MRI parameter -LRB- s -RRB- .
26032924|METHODS : T1-weighted MRI -LRB- 3 T -RRB- morphometry using multiple parameters of hippocampus-parahippocampus -LRB- angular and linear measures , volumetry -RRB- and amygdalae -LRB- volumetry -RRB- including their hemispheric asymmetry indices -LRB- AI -RRB- were evaluated in both genders .
26032924|Few patients -LRB- both genders -RRB- had combined bilateral appearances of hippocampal atrophy , amygdala atrophy , PHA acuteness , and increase in hippocampal angle -LRB- HA -RRB- where medial distance ratio -LRB- MDR -RRB- varied among genders .
26032924|CONCLUSION : Multiparametric MRI studies of hippocampus and amygdalae , including their hemispheric asymmetry , underscore better characterization of TLE .
26040546|Compared with HC , AD exhibited increased within-network FC in salience -LRB- SN -RRB- , default mode -LRB- DMN -RRB- , orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFCN -RRB- , left executive control -LRB- LECN -RRB- and amygdala-striatum -LRB- ASN -RRB- networks .
26042728|Abnormal amygdala function in Parkinson 's disease patients and its relationship to depression .
26042728|Among these areas , the amygdala may present with the earliest to be damaged in PD .
26042728|However , it is still unclear whether amygdala structural and functional changes are related to depression in PD .
26042728|Structural and resting-state functional brain images were also acquired to assess volumetric and functional changes of the amygdala in the patients .
26042728|Results showed that although there is no significant volume change , left amygdala activity increased in the PD group compared with the normal control group , and it correlated with Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores .
26042728|Furthermore , functional connectivity between the right amygdala and fronto-parietal areas was found to be decreased in the depressed PD patients compared with non-depressed PD patients .
26042728|These results suggest that abnormal amygdala function may underlie the occurrence of depression in PD .
26048176|Mindfulness meditation training alters stress-related amygdala resting state functional connectivity : a randomized controlled trial .
26048176|The present research evaluates whether mindfulness meditation training alters resting state functional connectivity -LRB- rsFC -RRB- of the amygdala , a region known to coordinate stress processing and physiological stress responses .
26048176|We show in an initial discovery study that higher perceived stress over the past month is associated with greater bilateral amygdala-subgenual anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- sgACC -RRB- rsFC in a sample of community adults -LRB- n = 130 -RRB- .
26048176|A follow-up , single-blind randomized controlled trial shows that a 3-day intensive mindfulness meditation training intervention -LRB- relative to a well-matched 3-day relaxation training intervention without a mindfulness component -RRB- reduced right amygdala-sgACC rsFC in a sample of stressed unemployed community adults -LRB- n = 35 -RRB- .
26048176|Although stress may increase amygdala-sgACC rsFC , brief training in mindfulness meditation could reverse these effects .
26048176|This work provides an initial indication that mindfulness meditation training promotes functional neuroplastic changes , suggesting an amygdala-sgACC pathway for stress reduction effects .
26048952|Children and adolescents with ASD , relative to typically developing -LRB- TD -RRB- participants , exhibited reduced activity in response to CT-targeted -LRB- arm -RRB- versus non-CT-targeted -LRB- palm -RRB- touch in a network of brain regions known to be involved in social-emotional information processing including bilateral insula and insular operculum , the right posterior superior temporal sulcus , bilateral temporoparietal junction extending into the inferior parietal lobule , right fusiform gyrus , right amygdala , and bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex including the inferior frontal and precentral gyri , suggesting atypical social brain hypoactivation .
26060327|Forty healthy older adults completed stress questionnaires , a social network interview and structural MRI to investigate the amygdala-medial prefrontal cortex circuitry , which is implicated in social and emotional processing and negatively affected by stress .
26060327|Social support was positively correlated with right medial prefrontal cortical thickness while amygdala volume was negatively associated with social support and positively related to stress .
26060327|We examined whether the association between social support and amygdala volume varied across stress level .
26060327|Stress and social support uniquely contribute to amygdala volume , which is consistent with the health benefits of social support being independent of stress .
26073067|The association between parents ' aggression and youths ' subsequent parent-directed aggression was statistically mediated by signal change coefficients in the insula , right amygdala , thalamus , and putamen .
26073231|In the included testosterone administration fMRI studies , which consisted of female samples only , bilateral amygdala/parahippocampal regions as well as the right caudate were significantly activated by social-affective stimuli in the testosterone condition .
26073231|In the studies considering endogenous levels of testosterone , stimuli-invoked activations relating to testosterone levels were noted in the bilateral amygdala/parahippocampal regions and the brainstem .
26073231|Significant stimuli-invoked deactivations relating to endogenous testosterone levels were also seen in the right and left amygdala/parahippocampal regions studies .
26073231|In children , boys showed a positive correlation between testosterone and brain volume in many regions , including the amygdala , as well as global grey matter volume , while girls showed a neutral or negative association between testosterone levels and many brain volumes .
26073231|In conclusion , amygdalar and parahippocampal regions appear to be key target regions for the acute actions of testosterone in response to social and affective stimuli , while neurodevelopmentally the volumes of a broader network of brain structures are associated with testosterone levels in a sexually dimorphic manner .
26074298|Five out of the seven emotions demonstrated consistent activation within the amygdala , whereas all emotions consistently activated the right inferior frontal gyrus , which has been implicated as an integration hub for affective and cognitive processes .
26075614|The amygdala together with the pulvinar and the superior colliculus are implicated in an ongoing debate regarding their role in automatic and deliberate spatial processing of threat signals .
26075614|The main idea justifying this double task is that amygdala and superior colliculus are involved in both automatic and controlled processes .
26075614|RESULTS : We found that stimulus-driven processing led to increased amygdala responses specifically to true snake shapes presented in the centre or in the peripheral left hemifield -LRB- right hemisphere -RRB- .
26075614|Similar hemispheric specialization was found across structures : increased amygdala responses occurred to true snake shapes presented to the right hemisphere , with this pattern being closely followed by the superior colliculus and the pulvinar .
26075614|CONCLUSION : These results show that subcortical structures containing foveal representations such as the amygdala , pulvinar and superior colliculus play distinct roles in the central and peripheral processing of snake shapes .
26084875|Among pathways within the brain circuit involved in feedback learning , abnormal white matter microstructure was observed in tracts , which connect left-hemispheric amygdala with hippocampus and entorhinal cortex .
26084875|Microstructure of right-hemispheric tracts between amygdala and entorhinal cortex was related to learning from negative feedback , and was not compromised in aMCI patients .
26088887|Volumetric changes in amygdala and entorhinal cortex and their relation to memory impairment in patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy with visually normal MR imaging findings .
26088887|OBJECTIVE : To explore the relation between parahippocampal structures , such as the amygdala and the entorhinal cortex -LRB- EC -RRB- , with verbal and nonverbal memory in patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy -LRB- MTLE -RRB- with visually normal MR imaging findings by volumetric measurements using magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- .
26088887|RESULTS : Volumetric MRI revealed significant differences between the volumes of the hippocampus , EC , and right amygdala , but no differences in the volume of the left amygdala between the controls and the patients group .
26088887|The asymmetry of the amygdala negatively correlated to verbal paired associates ' recall and nonsense graphical recognition .
26088887|CONCLUSION : The volumetric asymmetry of the amygdala contributes to either verbal or nonverbal memory impairment in MTLE patients .
26094609|Type I and Type II alexithymia were characterized by gray matter volume reductions in the left amygdala and the thalamus .
26094609|The cognitive dimension was further linked to volume reductions in the right amygdala , left posterior insula , precuneus , caudate , hippocampus , and parahippocampus .
26095038|METHODS : For inducing amygdala kindling and deep brain stimulation , bipolar stainless-steel electrodes were implanted in SD rats into right basolateral amygdala and right GPe , respectively .
26095038|The effects of deep brain stimulation were evaluated in the amygdala kindling model , maximal electroshock model -LRB- MES -RRB- and pentylenetetrazole -LRB- PTZ -RRB- model .
26095038|Moreover , the background EEGs in the amygdala and GPe were recorded .
26095038|High-frequency stimulation -LRB- 0.1 ms , 130 Hz , 5 min -RRB- at the GPe had no anti-epileptic effect and even aggravated epileptogenesis induced by amygdala kindling .
26106363|In conclusion , amygdala swelling , retrograde biographic memory impairment , accelerated long-term forgetting , and emotional instability may serve as indicators of limbic encephalitis , even in the absence of overt epileptic seizures .
26106525|Two neural regions , involved in behavioral control and emotion regulation , are often implicated : amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- VMPFC -RRB- .
26106525|Recently , in studies using adult criminal populations , reductions in microstructural integrity of the white matter connections -LRB- i.e. , uncinate fasciculus -LRB- UF -RRB- -RRB- between these two neural regions have been discovered in criminals with psychopathy , supporting the notion of neural dysfunction in the amygdala-VMPFC circuit .
26106525|Findings provide further support for the notion of altered amygdala-VMPFC connectivity in association with higher psychopathic traits .
26107810|Furthermore , glucose increased rsFC of the left caudatus and putamen , precuneus and lingual gyrus more than fructose , whereas within the basal ganglia/limbic network , fructose increased rsFC of the left amygdala , left hippocampus , right parahippocampus , orbitofrontal cortex and precentral gyrus more than glucose .
26110110|We also performed region of interest analysis for the hippocampus , anterior cingulate cortex , amygdala and precuneus .
26112339|Altered amygdala-prefrontal response to facial emotion in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder .
26112339|The activation analyses revealed greater right amygdala activation to emotional faces versus shapes in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder and offspring of non-bipolar parents than healthy controls .
26112339|Given that abnormally increased amygdala activation during emotion processing characterized offspring of both patient groups , and that abnormally increased amygdala activation has often been reported in individuals with already developed bipolar disorder and those with major depressive disorder , these neuroimaging findings may represent markers of increased risk for affective disorders in general .
26112339|The analysis of psychophysiological interaction revealed that offspring of parents with bipolar disorder showed significantly more negative right amygdala-anterior cingulate cortex functional connectivity to emotional faces versus shapes , but significantly more positive right amygdala-left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex functional connectivity to happy faces -LRB- all P-values corrected for multiple tests -RRB- than offspring of non-bipolar parents and healthy controls .
26112339|Taken together with findings of increased amygdala-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex functional connectivity , and decreased amygdala-anterior cingulate cortex functional connectivity previously shown in individuals with bipolar disorder , these connectivity patterns in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder may be risk markers for , rather than markers conferring protection against , bipolar disorder in youth .
26114921|They also exhibited reduced activity in the thalamus , putamen , and amygdala , and increased activity in the right hippocampus relative to controls .
26115440|Whereas increased amygdala activity has been associated with phasic fear , sustained anxiety has been linked with activation of the bed nucleus of stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- , anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , and the insula .
26115440|RESULTS : Phobic patients revealed significantly higher amygdala activation than controls under conditions of phasic fear .
26115440|Functional connectivity analysis revealed enhanced connectivity of the BNST and the amygdala in phobic subjects .
26141925|Additionally , there was an interaction between social status and UG offer fairness in the amygdala and thalamus , implicating the role of these regions in the modulation of social status on fairness perception .
26151925|Increased neurokinin-1 receptor availability in the amygdala in social anxiety disorder : a positron emission tomography study with -LSB- -LRB- 11 -RRB- C -RSB- GR205171 .
26151925|The neurokinin-1 -LRB- NK1 -RRB- receptor is abundantly expressed in the fear circuitry of the brain , including the amygdala , where it modulates stress and anxiety .
26151925|Voxel-wise statistical parametric mapping analyses revealed increased NK1 receptor availability specifically in the right amygdala in SAD patients relative to controls .
26151925|Thus , we demonstrate that exaggerated social anxiety is related to enhanced NK1 receptor availability in the amygdala .
2616032|The binding of -LSB- 3H -RSB- nipecotic acid , a ligand for labelling GABA uptake sites in brain , was measured in left and right frontal cortex , polar temporal cortex , hippocampus and amygdala from control and schizophrenic postmortem brains .
2616032|In schizophrenic brains , single concentration -LSB- 3H -RSB- nipecotic acid binding was reduced bilaterally in amygdala and hippocampus and on the left side only in polar temporal cortex .
26161254|Intolerance of uncertainty predicts fear extinction in amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortical circuitry .
26161254|BACKGROUND : Coordination of activity between the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- is important for fear-extinction learning .
26161254|RESULTS : During early extinction learning , we found low IU scores to be associated with larger skin conductance responses and right amygdala activity to learned threat vs. safety cues , whereas high IU scores were associated with no skin conductance discrimination and greater activity within the right amygdala to previously learned safety cues .
26161254|In late extinction learning , low IU scores were associated with successful inhibition of previously learned threat , reflected in comparable skin conductance response and right amgydala activity to learned threat vs. safety cues , whilst high IU scores were associated with continued fear expression to learned threat , indexed by larger skin conductance and amygdala activity to threat vs. safety cues .
26162239|Our task elicited a strong activation of the mentalizing network , including bilateral precuneus , -LRB- anterior , middle , and posterior -RRB- cingulate cortices , temporal poles , inferior frontal gyri -LRB- IFG -RRB- , temporoparietal junctions , superior medial frontal gyri as well as right medial orbital frontal gyrus , superior temporal gyrus , middle frontal gyrus -LRB- MFG -RRB- , and amygdala .
26162239|We found that AV is positively and ANX negatively correlated with task-associated neural activity in the right amygdala , MFG , midcingulate cortex , and superior parietal lobule , and in bilateral IFG .
26165776|The RS-fMRI revealed augmented amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation -LRB- ALFF -RRB- in the anterior cingulate cortex , hippocampus , insula , amygdala and putamen , and reduced ALFF in the precuneus , thalamus , pre-central and post-central gyri .
26165776|Cross modality association analyses indicated that activations of the amygdala and postcentral gyrus were correlated with DTI measurements of the right EC and left PTR respectively .
26168707|In this study , we evaluate the hypothesis that pain-related gamma oscillatory responses are coupled with low-frequency oscillations in the frontal lobe , amygdala and hippocampus , areas known to have roles in pain processing .
26168707|Our results show that painful laser stimulations enhanced low-gamma -LRB- LH , 40-70 Hz -RRB- and high-gamma -LRB- HG , 70-110 Hz -RRB- oscillatory responses in the amygdala and hippocampal regions on the right hemisphere and these gamma responses were significantly coupled with the phases of theta -LRB- 4-7 Hz -RRB- and alpha -LRB- 8-1 2 Hz -RRB- rhythms during pain processing .
26171720|Studies of extinction-related structural volumes -LRB- amygdala , hippocampus , anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , and ventral medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- -RRB- and this stress diathesis , in maltreated youth were not previously investigated .
26171720|Maltreated youth without PTSD demonstrated larger left amygdala and right hippocampal volumes compared with maltreated youth with PTSD and non-maltreated control youth .
26171720|PTSD symptoms inversely correlated with right and left hippocampal and left amygdala volumes .
26174547|Ictal perfusion changes associated with seizure progression in the amygdala kindling model in the rhesus monkey .
26174547|In the macaque monkey , electrical amygdala kindling develops slowly and provides an opportunity for investigating ictal perfusion changes during epileptogenesis .
26174547|METHODS : Two rhesus monkeys were electrically kindled through chronically implanted electrodes in the right amygdala over a period of 16 and 17 months .
26188354|-LSB- The importance of amygdala removal in the surgical treatment of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy -RSB- .
26188354|Even though amygdalar lesions are a known epilepsy model in laboratory animals , the role of the amygdala in mesial temporal sclerosis is not well-known .
26188354|The aim of this article is to emphasize the role of the amygdala in order to render a patient seizure free .
26188354|They were evaluated again for surgery , and subdural grids were placed , together with a deep electrode in the remnants of the amygdala .
26188354|The amygdalar electrode showed to be the seizure onset in the two cases , and its resection rendered both patients seizure free .
26188354|These two patients show that a complete amygdalar resection is necessary to render some patients seizure free .
26188354|It might be the amygdala has a greater role than previously thought .
26192104|Changes in activity in the amygdala and parahippocampal cortex distinguished PTSD from both control groups .
26204524|A psychophysiological interaction analysis indicated a functional connectivity between the middle frontal gyrus -LRB- seed region -RRB- and bilateral insular cortices , the left amygdala and the supplementary motor area .
26210693|When participants were administered escitalopram -LRB- relative to a placebo -RRB- and asked to reappraise negative emotional stimuli , left amygdala activation was decreased and right inferior frontal gyrus -LRB- R IFG -RRB- activation was increased .
26210693|Also observed was a greater negative left amygdala-R IFG functional connectivity when participants were administered escitalopram relative to placebo , and this change in connectivity was associated with reductions in subjective ratings of valence and arousal of negative stimuli .
26211435|VLSM analysis carried out on naming errors revealed that left-lateralized lesions in the inferior frontal gyrus , amygdala , insula and basal ganglia were associated with the lexical-semantic processing of social groups .
26211620|Evidence for smaller right amygdala volumes in posttraumatic stress disorder following childhood trauma .
26211620|Hippocampus and amygdala volumes in posttraumatic stress disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- related to childhood trauma are relatively understudied , albeit the potential importance to the disorder .
26211620|Whereas some studies reported smaller hippocampal volumes , little evidence was found for abnormal amygdala volumes .
26211620|Here we investigated hippocampus and amygdala volumes and shapes in an adult sample of PTSD patients related to childhood trauma .
26211620|Hippocampus and amygdala were segmented , and volumes were calculated and corrected for the total intracranial volume .
26211620|Smaller right amygdala volumes were found in PTSD patients as compared with the controls .
26211620|Severity of sexual abuse during childhood was negatively correlated with the size of the amygdala .
26211620|Although our results are not conclusive , traumatic events in childhood might impede normal development of the amygdala , which could render a person more vulnerable to develop PTSD later in life .
26217205|The role of the amygdala in the perception of positive emotions : an `` intensity detector '' .
26217205|The specific role of the amygdala remains controversial even though the development of functional imaging techniques has established its implication in the emotional process .
26217205|The aim of this study was to highlight the sensitivity of the amygdala to emotional intensity -LRB- arousal -RRB- .
26217205|We conducted an analysis of the modulation of amygdala activation according to variation in emotional intensity via an fMRI event-related protocol .
26217205|We demonstrated that the left and right amygdalae were sensitive to changes in emotional intensity , activating more in response to stimuli with higher intensity .
26217205|These results highlight the sensitivity of the amygdala to the intensity of positively valenced visual stimuli , and in conjunction with results in the literature on negative emotions , reinforce the role of the amygdala in the perception of intensity .
26220745|Animal studies suggest that the neural circuitry responsible fear renewal includes the hippocampus , amygdala , and dorsomedial -LRB- dmPFC -RRB- and ventromedial -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- prefrontal cortex .
26220745|We used functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- , combined with psychophysiology and immersive virtual reality , to elucidate how the hippocampus , amygdala , and dmPFC and vmPFC interact to drive the context-dependent renewal of extinguished fear .
26220745|Structural equation modeling revealed that the dmPFC fully mediated the effect of the hippocampus on right amygdala activity during fear renewal , whereas the vmPFC partially mediated the effect of the hippocampus on right amygdala activity during extinction recall .
26222050|Potential differences in BOLD response across diagnostic groups were explored at whole-brain level in addition to amygdala as a region of interest .
26222050|For amygdala activation , there were no correlations with diagnostic status or PGRS .
26223261|The results highlighted both shared and distinct connectivity of these 2 midbrain structures , as well as an opposite pattern of connectivity to bilateral amygdala , pulvinar , and right anterior insula .
26229470|Disconnection of the hippocampus and amygdala associated with lesion load in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis : a structural and functional connectivity study .
26229470|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : Little is known about the functional and structural connectivity -LRB- FC and SC -RRB- of the hippocampus and amygdala , which are two important structures involved in cognitive processes , or their involvement in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis -LRB- RRMS -RRB- .
26229470|In this study , we aimed to examine the connectivity of white-matter -LRB- WM -RRB- tracts and the synchrony of intrinsic neuronal activity in outer regions connected with the hippocampus or amygdala in RRMS patients .
26229470|Diffusion tensor probabilistic tractography was used to examine the SC , the FC correlation coefficient -LRB- FC-CC -RRB- and combined FC strength -LRB- FCS -RRB- , which was derived from the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging used to examine the FC , of the connection between the hippocampus or the amygdala and other regions , and the correlations of these connections with clinical markers .
26229470|RESULTS : Compared with healthy subjects , the RRMS patients showed significantly decreased SC and increased FCS of the bilateral hippocampus , and left amygdala .
26229470|Their slightly increased FC-CC was positively correlated with WM tract damage in the right hippocampus -LRB- ? = 0.57 , P = 0.005 -RRB- ; an increased FCS was also positively correlated with WM tract damage in the right amygdala .
26229470|CONCLUSION : The concurrent increased functional connections and demyelination-related structural disconnectivity between the hippocampus or amygdala and other regions in RRMS suggest that the functional-structural relationships require further investigation .
26231122|Current data support the finding that mindful self-focused attention is effective in regulating amygdala activity in BPD as well as in healthy subjects .
26233431|A region of interest mask containing the superior temporal cortex , amygdala , orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- , insular cortex , and medial frontal cortex was used .
26234034|Using the morphometric method , neuron profile field areas and the density of neurons and gliocytes were measured in amygdala basolateral nucleus in left and right hemispheres of the brain in 6 men and 6 women aged 19 to 55 years .
26239289|Neuroimaging data from the Duke Neurogenetics Study -LRB- N = 312 -RRB- provide evidence of this SNP 's in vivo functionality ; rs10799590 A allele carriers displayed significantly greater right amygdala habituation to threat-related facial expressions , a phenotype associated with resilience to psychopathology .
26244883|Furthermore , BP showed decreased activation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- during the monitoring and a lack of bilateral amygdala deactivation during the resolution of the emotional conflict .
26244883|CONCLUSIONS : Overall , our results highlighted dysfunctional processing of the emotion conflict in euthymic BP that may be subtended by abnormal activity and connectivity of the DLPFC during the conflict monitoring , which , in turn , leads to failure of amygdala deactivation during the resolution of the conflict .
26245837|Threat-related amygdala functional connectivity is associated with 5-HTTLPR genotype and neuroticism .
26245837|Communication between the amygdala and other brain regions critically regulates sensitivity to threat , which has been associated with risk for mood and affective disorders .
26245837|Using functional magnetic resonance imaging , we evaluated independent and interactive effects of the 5-HTTLPR genotype and neuroticism on amygdala functional connectivity during an emotional faces paradigm in 76 healthy individuals .
26245837|Functional connectivity between left amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- and between both amygdalae and a cluster including posterior cingulate cortex , precuneus and visual cortex was significantly increased in 5-HTTLPR S ' allele carriers relative to LALA individuals .
26245837|Neuroticism was negatively correlated with functional connectivity between right amygdala and mPFC and visual cortex , and between both amygdalae and left lateral orbitofrontal -LRB- lOFC -RRB- and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- vlPFC -RRB- .
26245837|Notably , 5-HTTLPR moderated the association between neuroticism and functional connectivity between both amygdalae and left lOFC/vlPFC , such that S ' carriers exhibited a more negative association relative to LALA individuals .
26245837|These findings provide novel evidence for both independent and interactive effects of 5-HTTLPR genotype and neuroticism on amygdala communication , which may mediate effects on risk for mood and affective disorders .
26246438|Neural activity in monkey amygdala during performance of a multisensory operant task .
26246438|In this paper , we study the potential involvement of monkey amygdala in the evaluation of value encoding of visual and auditive stimuli associated with reward or no reward .
26246438|We recorded the activity of 93 extracellular neurons from the monkey right amygdala , while performing a multisensory operant task .
26246438|These findings suggest that neurons in the amygdala play a role in encoding value and processing visual information , participate in motor regulation and are sensitive to reward .
26246438|These data support the hypothesis that amygdala neurons are specific to each sensory modality and that different groups of amygdala neurons process visual and auditive information .
26247493|Abnormalities in neural circuits underlying affect regulation have been observed in BD , specifically in the structure and function of the amygdala and orbital frontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- .
26249265|A priori regions of interest -LRB- ROI -RRB- included orbitofrontal and cingulate cortices , amygdala , hippocampus and thalamus .
26251769|Decision trees and ensemble tree multivariate models yielded four common independent predictors of PTSD : right superior longitudinal fasciculus tract volume on MRI ; resting state connectivity between the right amygdala and left superior temporal gyrus -LRB- BA41/42 -RRB- on functional MRI ; and single nucleotide polymorphisms in the genes coding for myelin basic protein as well as brain-derived neurotrophic factor .
26254541|Volume and shape metrics were derived from manually segmented S-MR images for the hippocampus , amygdala , caudate nucleus , and lateral ventricles .
26260493|We used a priori bilateral anatomical amygdala seed-driven resting connectivity and probabilistic tractography of the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus together with a data-driven multivoxel pattern analysis of whole-brain resting-state connectivity before treatment to predict improvement in social anxiety after CBT .
26262937|Inhibition of glutamine synthetase in the central nucleus of the amygdala induces anhedonic behavior and recurrent seizures in a rat model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy .
26262937|Glutamine synthetase , an astrocytic enzyme that metabolizes glutamate and ammonia to glutamine , is reduced in the amygdala in patients with epilepsy and depression and in suicide victims .
26262937|Here , we sought to develop a novel model of anhedonia in MTLE by testing the hypothesis that deficiency in glutamine synthetase in the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- leads to epilepsy and comorbid anhedonia .
26262937|Neurons were lost in the CeA , but not the medial amygdala , lateral amygdala , basolateral amygdala , or the hilus of the dentate gyrus , in the MSO-treated rats .
26264515|We identified increased grey matter volume in the right anterior hippocampus/amygdala and parahippocampus in sudden death cases and people at high risk , when compared to those at low risk and controls .
26265034|These changes in global FCD were driven by abnormal local connectivity changes and reduced functional connectivity -LRB- FC -RRB- toward the left amygdala for MCC , and increased FC toward the right supplementary motor area for OCC .
26275382|The left amygdala : A shared substrate of alexithymia and empathy .
26275382|The left amygdala was identified as a key substrate of both alexithymia and empathy .
26275382|This association was characterized by an opposite pattern : The cognitive alexithymia dimension was linked to smaller , the two empathy dimensions to larger left amygdala volume .
26275382|Moreover , structural covariance patterns between the left amygdala and other emotion-related brain regions differed markedly between alexithymia and empathy .
26283642|In depressed volunteers , changes in IL-18 were more pronounced -LRB- F2 ,25 = 3.6 , P = 0.03 -RRB- and linearly proportional to sadness-induced ?-opioid activation -LRB- left ventral pallidum , bilateral anterior cingulate cortices , right hypothalamus and bilateral amygdala -RRB- .
26288290|-LSB- Morphometric features of the structure of the central nucleus of the amygdala in men and women -RSB- .
26288290|OBJECTIVE : To identify the interhemispheric asymmetry in the structure of the central nucleus of the amygdala in men and women .
26288290|MATERIAL AND METHODS : Morphometric features of the structure of neurons of the central nucleus amygdala complex were studied in histological sections of the brain of 6 men and 6 women -LRB- 24 hemispheres -RRB- , aged 19 to 55 years , with no lifetime diagnosis of mental or neurological disease .
26288290|The value of the profile fields of neurons of the central nucleus amygdala complex in the left and right hemispheres of the brain were investigated .
26288290|In addition , the quantity of relevant fields of neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala in women was significantly larger than that of men in both hemispheres .
26289141|Clinical improvement in affective lability correlated positively with left posterior-medial orbitofrontal cortex/ventral striatum activation , and negatively with right amygdala/parahippocampal activation .
2629012|These data do not support the presence of a significant contribution by a hippocampal/amygdala generator to the activity of the scalp-recorded P300 in the oddball paradigm .
26290423|Associations between age and -LSB- -LRB- 11 -RRB- C -RSB- ABP688 BPND without PVC were observed in the right amygdala and left putamen , but were not significant after multiple comparisons correction .
26291695|Functional dysconnection in the prefrontal-amygdala circuitry in unaffected siblings of patients with bipolar I disorder .
26291695|However , it has not been determined whether functional abnormalities of the dlPFC-amygdala circuit exist in unaffected , healthy siblings of the patients with BD -LRB- BDsib -RRB- .
26291695|We investigated seed-based FC -LRB- seeds : dlPFC -RRB- with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and GU in the regions of interest -LRB- e.g. , dlPFC and amygdala -RRB- using -LRB- 18 -RRB- F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography .
26291695|RESULTS : The FC in the dlPFC -LRB- right -RRB- - amygdala circuit was statistically abnormal in patients with BD and BDsib , but only the patients with BD demonstrated hypoactive GU bilaterally in the dlPFC and hyperactive GU bilaterally in the amygdala .
26291695|Facilitating differentiation between the BD groups , the altered FC between dlPFC -LRB- right -RRB- and amygdala -LRB- left -RRB- was even more prominent in the patients with BD -LRB- p < 0.05 -RRB- .
26291695|CONCLUSIONS : There was a dysfunctional connection with intact GU in the dlPFC-amygdala circuit of the BDsib , which highlights the vulnerability in families with BD .
26299298|Studies in adults with BD suggest that disruptions in amygdalar neural circuitry explain the pathophysiology underlying the disorder .
26299298|Importantly , however , amygdala subregion networks have not yet been examined in youth close to mania onset .
26299298|The goal of this study was to compare resting state functional connectivity patterns in amygdala subregions in youth with bipolar I disorder with patterns in healthy controls .
26299298|METHOD : Centromedial , laterobasal , and superficial amygdala subdivisions were assessed during rest and examined in relation to clinical measures of mania in youth -LRB- 14-20 years old -RRB- with bipolar I disorder who experienced only a single episode of mania -LRB- BD ; n = 20 -RRB- and age-matched healthy comparison youth without any personal or family history of DSM-IV Axis I disorders -LRB- HC ; n = 23 -RRB- .
26299298|RESULTS : Relative to HC youth , youth with BD exhibited decreased connectivity between the laterobasal subdivision of the amygdala and the hippocampus and precentral gyrus , and increased connectivity between the laterobasal subdivision and the precuneus .
26299298|Connectivity between the right laterobasal amygdala and right hippocampus was positively correlated with levels of anxiety in BD but not in HC youth , and connectivity between the right laterobasal amygdala and right precuneus was negatively correlated with insight about bipolar illness .
26299298|CONCLUSION : Youth with BD have abnormal amygdala resting state network connections to regions that are critical for emotional processing and self-awareness .
26300387|The main results include : -LRB- 1 -RRB- left hemisphere language areas -LRB- left inferior frontal gyrus , LIFG ; left superior temporal gyrus , LSTG -RRB- , premotor cortex -LRB- PM -RRB- , and presupplementary motor area -LRB- pSMA -RRB- were strongly activated by both sentence types ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- processing accidental action , relative to intentional action , elicited greater activity in LIFG , medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- MPFC -RRB- , and left amygdala ; no statistically significant activity was found in the opposite contrast ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- greater percent signal change was observed in LIFG while processing accidental action and in right precentral gyrus for intentional action .
26305475|In addition , adolescents with IGD were negatively correlated with activity in the right amygdala toward swear words , indicating the important role of the amygdala in the control of aggression in adolescents with IGD .
26305476|Functional connectivity seeded in the right amygdala and right temporoparietal junction revealed decreased coupling with the anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , anterior insula , striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex .
26305476|In the explicit task , higher trait psychopathy predicted reduced signal change in ACC and amygdala , accompanied by decreased functional connectivity to temporal pole , insula and striatum , but increased connectivity with dorsal ACC .
26308883|Whole-brain , hippocampus , amygdala , ventral striatum , and orbitofrontal cortex volumes were related to lifetime cannabis use -LRB- ever used , age at onset , and frequency of use -RRB- using linear regressions .
26308883|RESULTS : Among 483 study participants , cannabis exposure was related to smaller left amygdala -LRB- approximately 2.3 % ; P = .007 -RRB- and right ventral striatum -LRB- approximately 3.5 % ; P < .005 -RRB- volumes .
26308883|The association between left amygdala volume and cannabis use was largely owing to shared genetic factors -LRB- ?g = -0.43 ; P = .004 -RRB- , while the origin of the association with right ventral striatum volumes was unclear .
26308883|Both the exposed and unexposed siblings in pairs discordant for cannabis exposure showed reduced amygdala volumes relative to members of concordant unexposed pairs -LRB- fixed effect = 12.56 ; t = 2.97 ; P = .003 -RRB- .
26308883|CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE : In this study , differences in amygdala volume in cannabis users were attributable to common predispositional factors , genetic or environmental in origin , with little support for causal influences .
26313395|Predictors of poor treatment response to additional CBT in real panic disorder patients : The role of DLPF , orbitofrontal cortex , parietal lobule , frontal eye field and amygdala in PD .
26313395|RESULTS : In non-responders compared to responders , we found increased pre-treatment activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally , left orbitofrontal cortex , left frontal eye field , right parietal lobule and left amygdala .
26318628|Across sexes , significant activations were observed in the dorso-medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- dmPFC -RRB- and the right amygdala .
26318628|Granger connectivity from right amygdala was significantly greater than that from dmPFC during the ` high negative ' condition , an effect driven by men .
26318628|As the dmPFC is involved in social cognition and action planning , and the amygdala-in threat detection , the connectivity results suggest that compared to women , men have a more evaluative , rather than purely affective , brain response during negative emotion processing .
26323252|Although there was no ingroup bias for empathy ratings , subjects showed altered neural activation in regions of the right fusiform gyrus , the cerebellum , the hippocampal and amygdala region during the pain  group interaction .
26325222|Trials requiring attention orienting away from threat engaged an executive and threat-attention network -LRB- dlPFC , vlPFC , mPFC , and amygdala -RRB- .
26326111|Comparing the functional profile of face-selective regions with the amygdala at 7 Tesla .
26326111|We further tested this hypothesis by examining how face-selective regions in the occipitotemporal cortex and the amygdala respond to dynamic and static face stimuli .
26326111|High-field strength -LRB- 7 Tesla -RRB- and high resolution -LRB- 1.25 mm isotropic -RRB- scans allowed us to functionally define face-selective voxels in the amygdala in almost all participants .
26326111|Similarly , the amygdala showed a comparable response to dynamic faces , as compared to static faces .
26326111|This pattern of responses in the amygdala , right posterior STS , right OFA , and right FFA suggests that the posterior STS may be preferentially involved in computing changeable aspects of faces , compared to the amygdala , FFA and OFA .
26336951|The hippocampus showed stronger connectivity with striatum , ventral tegmental area and amygdala-regions important for integrating reward and affective signals , whereas the PHG showed stronger connectivity with unimodal and polymodal association cortices .
26341949|This study aims to investigate the relationship of peripheral serum BDNF levels to cortical thickness and volumes of the hippocampus and amygdala .
26343316|Interaction analyses revealed that the right inferior parietal lobule was specifically active when participants viewed averted eyes relative to straight eyes under the supraliminal condition ; the bilateral subcortical regions , including the superior colliculus and amygdala , and the middle temporal and inferior frontal gyri in the right hemisphere were activated in response to averted versus straight eyes under the subliminal condition .
26346195|Altered superficial amygdala-cortical functional link in resting state after 36 hours of total sleep deprivation .
26346195|The superficial amygdala -LRB- SFA -RRB- is important in human emotion/affective processing via its strong connection with other limbic and cerebral cortex for receptive and expressive emotion processing .
26346195|Our results suggest that the amygdala can not be treated as a single unit in human neuroimaging studies and that TSD may alter the functional connectivity pattern of the SFA , which in turn disrupts emotional regulation .
26347127|In the ABIDE imaging dataset , gray matter -LRB- GM -RRB- patterns in the motor cortex , supplementary motor area -LRB- SMA -RRB- , cerebellum , fusiform gyrus , and amygdala accurately discriminated girls and boys with ASD .
26347227|Cannabis use in early adolescence : Evidence of amygdala hypersensitivity to signals of threat .
26347227|Results indicated that cannabis users had greater reactivity in the bilateral amygdalae to angry faces than neutral faces , an effect that was not observed in their abstinent peers .
26347227|Given the high density of cannabinoid receptors in the amygdala , our findings suggest cannabis use in early adolescence is associated with hypersensitivity to signals of threat .
26347412|Global and somatic anxiety were associated with the limbic and paralimbic structures -LRB- increased connectivity between the amygdala , PVN , and hippocampus -RRB- , while neuroticism was correlated with increased connectivity between limbic and prefrontal structures .
26350954|Specifically , the left hippocampus was segmented into three distinct clusters : an emotional processing cluster supported by structural and functional connectivity to the amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus , a cognitive operations cluster , with functional connectivity to the anterior cingulate and inferior frontal gyrus , and a posterior perceptual cluster with distinct structural connectivity patterns to the occipital lobe coupled with functional connectivity to the precuneus and angular gyrus .
26351854|Compared to healthy volunteers , participants with RSI exhibited decreased brain activity in the motor network , but increased activity in the hippocampus and amygdala .
26351854|Furthermore , brain activity was correlated with apprehension intensity in the left amygdala and left thalamus during the motor imagery task -LRB- memory-induced -RRB- , while a correlation between apprehension intensity and brain activity was found in the left prefrontal cortex during the passive motion task -LRB- instability-induced -RRB- .
26356376|Human amygdala activation by the sound produced during dental treatment : A fMRI study .
26356376|Subjects also showed stimulation in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex , indicating that the ultrasonic auditory stimuli elicited an unpleasant response in the subjects .
26356376|This study was indicated by observed stimulation of the auditory cortex as well as the amygdala , indicating that noise from the ultrasonic scaling handpiece was perceived as an aversive auditory stimulus by the subjects .
26364910|As a whole , the cortical loop rearranged by adolescent LP-211 exposure consisted in a hippocampus receiving connections from piriform cortex and dorsal striatum , the latter both directly and through functional control over the ` extended amygdala ' .
26373348|Danger-based traumas were associated with higher metabolism in the right amygdala than the control groups , while non-danger-based traumas associated with heightened precuneus metabolism relative to the danger group .
26373348|In the danger group , PTSD severity was associated with higher metabolism in precuneus and dorsal anterior cingulate and lower metabolism in left amygdala -LRB- R -LRB- 2 -RRB- = 0.61 -RRB- .
26373348|In the non-danger group , PTSD symptom severity was associated with higher precuneus metabolism and lower right amygdala metabolism -LRB- R -LRB- 2 -RRB- = 0.64 -RRB- .
26377462|In addition , RFIC and bilateral subcortical neural activity -LRB- e.g. , thalamus , amygdala , hippocampus , putamen -RRB- was associated positively with maternal mental state talk but not with more global aspects of observed caregiving .
26382634|Effects of intranasal oxytocin on amygdala reactivity to emotional faces in recently trauma-exposed individuals .
26382634|Attenuating amygdala hyperreactivity early post-trauma , a likely PTSD vulnerability factor , may decrease PTSD risk .
26382634|Since oxytocin modulates amygdala reactivity to emotional stimuli , oxytocin administration early post-trauma may be a promising candidate for PTSD prevention .
26382634|In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled fMRI study , we investigated effects of a single intranasal oxytocin administration -LRB- 40 IU -RRB- on amygdala reactivity to happy , neutral and fearful faces in 41 recently trauma-exposed men and women showing moderate to high distress after initial post-trauma screening .
26382634|Compared with placebo , oxytocin significantly increased right amygdala reactivity to fearful faces .
26382634|There was a significant treatment by sex interaction on amygdala reactivity to neutral faces , with women showing increased left amygdala reactivity after oxytocin .
26386898|Surface shape and volume differences of 6 subcortical structures that are involved in language processing , including nuclei pallidum , putamen , caudate , amygdala , thalamus , and hippocampus from both hemispheres , were compared between groups .
26386898|RESULTS : Significantly reduced volumes of both the left and right side caudate nuclei , thalami and right side amygdala were shown in patients when compared with controls .
26388257|Resting-state connectivity of the amygdala predicts response to cognitive behavioral therapy in obsessive compulsive disorder .
26388257|RESULTS : The degree centrality of the right basolateral nuclei group of the amygdala was positively correlated with the response to subsequent CBT .
26388257|OCD patients showed a lower degree centrality of the superficial amygdala -LRB- bilateral -RRB- .
26388257|CONCLUSIONS : Our results suggest that two different sub-regions of the amygdala and their respective neural networks are affected in OCD : the superficial amygdala and networks related to evaluation of reinforcers and risk anticipation and the basolateral amygdala which is implicated in fear processing .
26388257|The diminished CBT response in patients showing a lower degree centrality of the basolateral amygdala reflects a deficient fear circuit in these patients which may impact fear extinction as a core mechanism of exposure-based CBT .
26388755|Specifically , following the creation manipulation there is an increased functional connectivity during valuation between the right caudate nucleus , where we show BOLD activity correlated with subjective value , and the left amygdala , where we show BOLD activity is linked to subjective belief .
26395813|Recent studies show an ECT-related increase in hippocampal , amygdala and subgenual cortex volume .
26395813|Right-hemispheric grey matter volume was increased in the caudate nucleus , medial temporal lobe -LRB- including hippocampus and amygdala -RRB- , insula and posterior superior temporal regions but did not correlate with MADRS score .
26400014|Neuroimaging revealed that negative valence and its interaction with force output correlated with increased activity in right inferior frontal gyrus -LRB- rIFG -RRB- , while arousal was associated with amygdala and periaqueductal gray -LRB- PAG -RRB- activation .
26401301|Compared to controls , individuals with PTSD showed increased integration of the left amygdala and the right insula within the SN .
26401301|CONCLUSIONS : Participants with PTSD showed enhanced coupling of the amygdala and the insula within the SN as compared to healthy control subjects during gaze processing .
26401700|This paper examines how age intervenes in the effects of APOE ?4 allele on the volume and shape morphometrics of the hippocampus and the amygdala in mild cognitive impairment -LRB- MCI -RRB- and Alzheimer 's disease .
26401700|The structures in the right hemisphere are found to be more affected by the APOE genotype than those in the left hemisphere and we identify the relevant regions in which significant atrophy occurs to be parts of the basolateral , centromedial , and lateral nucleus subregions of the amygdala and the CA1 and subiculum subregions of the hippocampus .
26406106|The amygdala is a hub in emotional processing , including that of negative affect .
26406106|Healthy men and women have distinct differences in amygdala responses , potentially setting the stage for the observed sex differences in the prevalence of fear , anxiety , and pain disorders .
26406106|Here , we examined how amygdala subnuclei resting-state functional connectivity is affected by sex , as well as explored how the functional connectivity is related to estrogen levels .
26406106|Resting-state functional connectivity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- with seeds placed in the left and right laterobasal -LRB- LB -RRB- and centromedial -LRB- CM -RRB- amygdala .
26406106|We found distinct sex differences in the LB and CM amygdala resting-state functional connectivity , as well as preliminary evidence for an association between estrogen levels and connectivity patterns .
26409130|Several studies suggest that highly emotional information could facilitate long-term memory encoding and consolidation processes via an amygdala-hippocampal network .
26413207|The thalamus , corpus striatum , hippocampus , amygdala , brainstem , callosum and ventricles were segmented from brain MRIs .
26420440|MRI showed a slightly increased signal in the right amygdala without progression .
26420574|We demonstrated that higher SRE was associated with smaller regional gray matter density -LRB- rGMD -RRB- in the anterior part of the posterior cingulate cortex -LRB- PCC -RRB- and higher rGMD in the right amygdala .
26420574|Depressive tendencies were associated with lower SRE and higher rGMD in the right amygdala .
26420574|These findings suggest that variations in stereotype on sex role have roots in the limbic brain structures linked to contentious interpersonal orientation -LRB- cingulate -RRB- and negative mood -LRB- amygdala -RRB- .
26424107|Although causality can not be inferred , findings also suggest that alterations in the left frontal lobe , right ACC , left hippocampus , corpus callosum , left and right amygdala and left caudate may be associated with poorer neurocognitive performance in the domains of processing speed , attention/working memory , abstraction/executive functions , motor skills , learning and language/fluency with these effects more pronounced in women living with both HIV and childhood trauma .
26431880|Although preclinical and clinical data strongly support an association between the amygdala and chronic pain by the presence of mood and cognitive disturbances in affected individuals , little attention has been paid to morphometric measurement of the structure in patients with chronic low back pain -LRB- CLBP -RRB- .
26431880|Our results indicated that the normalized volumes of the left and right amygdala were significantly smaller in the CLBP group than in the control group .
26431880|The degree of volume reduction was different between the left and right amygdala , with a greater involvement of the left side .
26431880|Both groups exhibited similar significant hemispheric asymmetry for the amygdala -LRB- left > right -RRB- .
26431880|No significant correlations were found between amygdala volumes and pain characteristics or depressive symptoms .
26431880|Our study provides in vivo imaging evidence of abnormal morphology of the amygdala in patients with CLBP using a fully automated segmentation method.PERSPECTIVE : Our study found that patients with CLBP had statistically significantly smaller normalized volumes of the bilateral amygdala , compared with healthy control individuals , with a greater involvement of the left side .
26432495|Recent results indicate that transient receptor channels 4 and 5 -LRB- TRPC4/C5 -RRB- in the amygdala have anxiogenic effects in rodents , while their role in chronic pain conditions is not known .
26432495|Rats with a spared nerve injury -LRB- SNI -RRB- model of neuropathy in the left hind limb had a chronic cannula for microinjections of drugs into the right amygdala or the internal capsule -LRB- a control site -RRB- .
26440605|During down-regulation of negative emotions , wide areas of the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- inhibit emotion-related brain areas such as the amygdala .
26442578|The results showed that social distress was correlated with the cortical volume of the right orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- and the subcortical volume of the left amygdala , while social avoidance was correlated with the cortical volume of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- .
26442578|Additionally , loneliness might mediate the relationship between the amygdala volume and the social distress score .
26444661|We describe an anatomic landmark , specifically the anterior temporal sulcus -LRB- ATS -RRB- , as a reliable method to define the anterior portion of the endorhinal sulcus and the superior limit of amygdala resection .
26444661|There was no injury to the optic tract , anterior choroidal artery or basal ganglia using ATS as the landmark for the superior limit of amygdala resection .
26444661|Following the ATS posteriorly on coronal MRI , it led to the endorhinal sulcus and accurately predicted the superior extent of amygdala resection in all 25 patients -LRB- 48 temporal lobes -RRB- .
26444661|CONCLUSION : The ATS is a reliable anatomical landmark that accurately delineates the superior border of the amygdala during ATL .
26444755|We were able to replicate `` classical '' cortical thickness alterations in aMCI in the hippocampus , amygdala , putamen , insula , and inferior temporal regions .
26454651|The amygdala is known to have a role in core processes regulated by the limbic system such as motivation , memory , emotion , social behavior , self-awareness as well as certain primitive instincts .
26454651|To date , few diffusion-weighted studies have focused on the amygdala , yet the fine connections of the amygdala , hypothalamus , septum or other adjacent limbic structures have yet to be elucidated by diffusion-weighted tractography studies .
26454651|The ventral amygdalofugal pathway , anterior commissure and stria terminalis are the three main efferent pathways of the amygdala .
26454816|Moreover , the significant interaction effect was found in the left amygdala , which showed that the monetary outcomes modulated the neural activity in the left amygdala only when truth-telling rather than lying .
26456416|They also had increased activation in several frontal , temporal , and parietal regions , but there was no evidence of amygdala activation in OCD or healthy participants and no significant between-group differences in performance on the emotion go/no-go task .
26459094|FSFI scores for orgasm correlated inversely with MS-lesion load in the left temporal periventricular white matter and right middle-inferior occipital area , but directly with MS-lesion load in the right frontal primary motor cortex , left prefrontal/inferior frontal cortex , right amygdala , left temporal middle-inferior and fusiform areas , and midbrain .
26459095|Human amygdala activations during nasal chemoreception .
26459095|This review serves as a comprehensive discussion of chemosensory stimulation of the amygdala in healthy humans .
26459095|Following an introduction of the neuroanatomy of chemosensory processing in primary and secondary olfactory structures , functional resonance magnetic imaging and positron imaging tomography studies are systematically categorized based on valence of stimuli , stimulus concentration , and paradigm-dependent amygdala activation .
26459095|The amygdala shows patterns of lateralization due to stimulus valence .
26459095|Main findings include pleasant odors being associated with bilateral or left amygdala activation , and unpleasant odors being associated with activation of the right amygdala , suggesting a crucial role of the right amygdala in evolutionary preservation .
26459095|Potentially threatening social stimuli , however , might be processed apart from the olfactory system and tend to activate the left amygdala .
26472591|RESULTS : Perceiving harm evoked increased hemodynamic response in the anterior insula -LRB- aINS -RRB- , anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , amygdala , periaqueductal gray -LRB- PAG -RRB- , caudate , and inferior parietal lobe -LRB- IPL -RRB- across all participants .
26472591|Intentionally caused , relative to unintentional harm was associated with greater activity in the aINS , amygdala , and temporal pole .
26473019|In NF1 patients , larger left putamen volume and larger total white matter volume were associated with more social problems and poorer executive functioning , larger right amygdala volume with poorer executive functioning and autistic mannerisms , and smaller precentral gyrus gray matter density was associated with more social problems .
26481674|fMRI neurofeedback of amygdala response to aversive stimuli enhances prefrontal-limbic brain connectivity .
26481674|Down-regulation of the amygdala with real-time fMRI neurofeedback -LRB- rtfMRI NF -RRB- potentially allows targeting brain circuits of emotion processing and may involve prefrontal-limbic networks underlying effective emotion regulation .
26481674|Little research has been dedicated to the effect of rtfMRI NF on the functional connectivity of the amygdala and connectivity patterns in amygdala down-regulation with neurofeedback have not been addressed yet .
26481674|Using psychophysiological interaction analysis of fMRI data , we present evidence that voluntary amygdala down-regulation by rtfMRI NF while viewing aversive pictures was associated with increased connectivity of the right amygdala with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- in healthy subjects -LRB- N = 16 -RRB- .
26481674|In contrast , a control group -LRB- N = 16 -RRB- receiving sham feedback did not alter amygdala connectivity -LRB- Group  Condition t-contrast : p < .05 at cluster-level -RRB- .
26481674|Task-dependent increases in amygdala-vmPFC connectivity were predicted by picture arousal -LRB- ? = .59 , p < .05 -RRB- .
26481674|A dynamic causal modeling analysis with Bayesian model selection aimed at further characterizing the underlying causal structure and favored a bottom-up model assuming predominant information flow from the amygdala to the vmPFC -LRB- xp = .90 -RRB- .
26481674|Taken together , the results underscore the potential of amygdala fMRI neurofeedback to influence functional connectivity in key networks of emotion processing and regulation .
26490568|When unpleasant -LRB- termed negative -RRB- stimuli were presented , depressed relative to healthy participants showed significantly decreased activation of the left amygdala and right Inferior Parietal Lobe -LRB- IPL -RRB- .
26490568|Notably , within-group analyses of healthy participants under the negative condition showed that depressive severity was positively correlated with activation in the left amygdala and left IPL .
26494872|The associations between brain activity , cognitive and emotional change , and outcome were analysed in 21 patients.ResultsPatients showed enhanced activity in the amygdala and ventral striatum compared with the control group .
26494872|Non-response to therapy was associated with enhanced activity in the right amygdala compared with those who responded , and activity in this region was negatively associated with outcome .
26497778|Time series were extracted from the right and left periaqueductal gray , and the right and left amygdala subregions .
26497778|RESULTS : Group by condition interaction effects were found from the periaqueductal gray to the right cerebellum VIIIa , the amygdala , the right premotor cortex/supplementary motor area and the insular cortex , and between the amygdala and the frontal pole/medial orbital frontal cortex , the hypothalamus , the insular cortex , the thalamus and the anterior cingulate cortex .
26502572|According to the incentive salience hypothesis , the mesolimbic dopamine reflects the motivation elicited by incentives -LRB- CSs -RRB- , and induces the drug seeking behavior , which is activated through amygdala -- nucleus accumbens -- medial prefrontal cortex circuit .
26503268|In A allele carriers , connectivity between the right middle frontal gyrus -LRB- MFG -RRB- and the right amygdala was higher in older -LRB- ? 14 years -RRB- than that in younger -LRB- < 14 years -RRB- probands , whereas TT homozygotes ? 14 years showed a reduction of fronto-limbic connectivity between the MFG and both the amygdala and the insula .
26503695|-LSB- Epub ahead of print -RSB- The effect of neuropeptide FF in the amygdala kindling model .
26503695|In this study , our aim was to determine whether NPFF exerts anticonvulsant or anti-epileptogenic effects in the rat amygdala kindling model for temporal lobe seizures .
26503695|METHODS : Male Wistar rats were implanted with a recording/stimulation electrode in the right amygdala and a cannula in the left lateral ventricle .
26503695|CONCLUSIONS : I.c.v. administration of NPFF reduced excitability in the amygdala in naive , but not in fully kindled rats , and had no effect on kindling acquisition .
26505142|BACKGROUND : Frontostriatal and frontoamygdalar connectivity alterations in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder -LRB- OCD -RRB- have been typically described in functional neuroimaging studies .
26505142|Altered structural covariance has been described in patients with different psychiatric disorders , including OCD , but to our knowledge , alterations within frontostriatal and frontoamygdalar circuits have not been explored .
26505142|METHODS : We performed a mega-analysis pooling structural MRI scans from the Obsessive-compulsive Brain Imaging Consortium and assessed whole-brain voxel-wise structural covariance of 4 striatal regions -LRB- dorsal and ventral caudate nucleus , and dorsal-caudal and ventral-rostral putamen -RRB- and 2 amygdalar nuclei -LRB- basolateral and centromedial-superficial -RRB- .
26505142|Patients with OCD also showed increased structural covariance between the right centromedial-superficial amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex .
26508777|To examine the mechanisms underlying CBTp-led changes in threat processing and appraisal , functional connectivity during the social threat -LRB- angry faces -RRB- condition was assessed separately from left amygdala and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- seeds .
26508777|At baseline , patients , compared with healthy participants , showed greater amygdala connectivity with the insula and visual areas , but less connectivity with somatosensory areas .
26508777|These differences normalized following CBTp and , compared with the SCO group , the + CBTp group showed greater increases in amygdala connectivity with DLPFC and inferior parietal lobule , with the latter correlating with improvement in positive symptoms .
26508861|Patients with ITN had decreased ReHo in the left amygdala , right parahippocampal gyrus , and left cerebellum and increased ReHo in the right inferior temporal gyrus , right thalamus , right inferior parietal lobule , and left postcentral gyrus -LRB- corrected -RRB- .
26513651|At the group level , metabolic dysfunction in the right amygdala , temporal pole , and middle cingulate cortex was highly correlated to the emotional recognition and attribution performances .
26514618|Aberrant function of frontoamygdala circuits in adolescents with previous verbal abuse experiences .
26514618|The right amygdala activity and its functional connectivity with the rostral anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- during implicit processing of negative emotional faces showed a significant relationship with previous verbal abuse experiences .
26514618|The hierarchical regression analyses showed that their current depressive symptoms were associated with aberrant functional interaction between the right amygdala activity and right amygdala-rostral ACC connectivity .
26514618|Our findings of verbal abuse-related functional changes in the right frontoamygdala circuit may be related to vulnerability to future mood disorder .
26519557|Then FC within the AN was assessed from a seed placed in the left amygdala -LRB- AMG -RRB- and FC within CCN was determined by placing seeds in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- DLPFC -RRB- .
26520770|Using executive control training to suppress amygdala reactivity to aversive information .
26520770|This ability is suggested to be mediated by the connectivity between prefrontal brain regions and the amygdala .
26520770|Participants who were trained using a high-frequent executive control -LRB- EC -RRB- task -LRB- 80 % incongruent trials -RRB- showed reduced amygdala reactivity and behavioral interference of aversive pictures .
26520770|Resting-state functional connectivity analysis revealed a marginally significant interaction between training group and change in the connectivity between the amygdala and the right inferior frontal gyrus -LRB- IFG -RRB- .
26520770|These findings are the first to show that non-emotional training can induce changes in amygdala reactivity to aversive information and alter amygdala-prefrontal connectivity .
26530395|OBJECTIVE : Although altered large-scale brain network organization in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy -LRB- TLE -RRB- has been shown using morphologic measurements such as cortical thickness , these studies , have not included critical subcortical structures -LRB- such as hippocampus and amygdala -RRB- and have had relatively small sample sizes .
2653385|CT examination of symptomatic autism showed the amygdala as one of the causative nuclei for the autistic behavior .
26541443|Activity in the bilateral frontal operculum and anterior insula , extending into bilateral putamen and right amygdala , was moderated as a function of actor-orientation -LRB- i.e. , first versus third-person engagement -RRB- and face-visibility -LRB- actor faces visible versus blurred -RRB- .
26545629|The whole patient group also had volume loss in the putamen , hippocampus , and accumbens bilaterally , in the corpus callosum and right amygdala .
26551661|Greater activation before versus after treatment emerged in the thalamus and amygdala during fearful versus neutral face processing .
26551661|These preliminary results suggest that aberrant emotional responding is modulated by noradrenergic plasticity within the amygdala-prefrontal cortex circuit , a neural substrate for the pharmacological treatment of PTSD .
26558713|Vomiting as an epileptic phenomenon seems to be related to the involvement of temporal structures , mainly mesial structures -LRB- amygdala -RRB- and with an uncertain role of the insula .
26581959|We utilized resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify altered amygdala connectivity in individuals with chronic TBI -LRB- 8 years post-injury on average -RRB- exhibiting comorbid depressive symptoms -LRB- N = 31 -RRB- , relative to chronic TBI individuals having minimal depressive symptoms -LRB- N = 23 -RRB- .
26581959|Connectivity analysis of these participant sub-groups revealed that the TBI-plus-depressive symptoms group showed relative increases in amygdala connectivity primarily in the regions that are part of the salience , somatomotor , dorsal attention , and visual networks -LRB- p voxel < 0.01 , p cluster < 0.025 -RRB- .
26581959|Relative increases in amygdala connectivity in the TBI-plus-depressive symptoms group were also observed within areas of the limbic-cortical mood-regulating circuit -LRB- the left dorsomedial and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortices and thalamus -RRB- and the brainstem .
26581959|Further analysis revealed that spatially dissociable patterns of correlation between amygdala connectivity and symptom severity according to subtypes -LRB- Cognitive and Affective -RRB- of depressive symptoms -LRB- p voxel < 0.01 , p cluster < 0.025 -RRB- .
26581959|Taken together , these results suggest that amygdala connectivity may be a potentially effective neuroimaging biomarker for comorbid depressive symptoms in chronic TBI .
26582983|Compared with CTRs , both + MJ and - MJ groups demonstrated hyper-connectivity of left amygdala seed with orbital frontal cortex and hypo-connectivity of posterior thalamus seed with hippocampus , suggesting vulnerability to multiple drugs in these circuits .
26584868|Pianists showed greater gray matter -LRB- GM -RRB- volume in bilateral putamen -LRB- extending also to hippocampus and amygdala -RRB- , right thalamus , bilateral lingual gyri and left superior temporal gyrus , but a GM volume shrinkage in the right supramarginal , right superior temporal and right postcentral gyri , when compared to non-musician controls .
26592799|The meta-regression analyses showed that studies including patients with higher HDRS scores were significantly more likely to present reduced GM volumes in the right amygdala .
26597151|Seed based analysis revealed greater functional connectivity between the left thalamus and the cerebellum after LPS compared to placebo administration , while the functional coupling between seeds within the amygdala , insula , and cingulate cortex and various brain regions including parieto-frontal networks was significantly reduced .
26627911|Among PCE versus NDE adolescents , illicit-substance use during stress processing was associated with decreased activity in cortical and subcortical regions including amygdala , hippocampus and prefrontal cortex .
2663114|Kornhuber J -LRB- 1 -RRB- , Mack-Burkhardt F , Riederer P. Author information : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Department of Psychiatry , University of Wrzburg , F.R.G. Specific -LSB- 3H -RSB- MK-801 binding was measured under equilibrium conditions in 8 brain regions -LRB- frontal cortex , area entorhinalis , hippocampus , amygdala , putamen , thalamus , substantia nigra and nucleus dentatus -RRB- in the right hemisphere of the human brain -LRB- n = 4 -RRB- .
2663114|High -LSB- 3H -RSB- MK-801 binding levels occurred in the area entorhinalis , frontal cortex , hippocampus and amygdala , medium levels were observed in the putamen and thalamus and low levels were found in the substantia nigra and nucleus dentatus .
26640379|Relationship between remnant hippocampus and amygdala and memory outcomes after stereotactic surgery for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy .
26640379|The aim of the present study was to correlate the volume of the remnant hippocampus and amygdala in patients treated by SAHE with changes in memory parameters .
26640379|Patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging examinations including hippocampal and amygdalar volumetry and neuropsychological evaluation preoperatively and 1 year after surgery .
26640379|Similarly , positive correlations between the extent of right amygdalar reduction and verbal MQ -LRB- ? = 0.74 ; P = 0.02 -RRB- and global MQ change -LRB- ? = 0.69 ; P = 0.03 -RRB- were found .
26640379|Thus , larger right hippocampal and amygdalar reduction was associated with higher global and verbal MQ change after SAHE .
26640768|The thalamus , caudate , putamen , pallidum , hippocampus , amygdala , brainstem , accumbens , callosum and ventricles were segmented from high-resolution MRIs .
26645207|Recent functional magnetic resonance -LRB- fMRI -RRB- imaging studies have revealed that subchronic medication with escitalopram leads to significant reduction in both amygdala and medial frontal gyrus reactivity during processing of emotional faces , suggesting that escitalopram may have a distinguishable modulatory effect on neural activation as compared with other serotonin-selective antidepressants .
26645207|Significantly reduced activation to fearful , but not to happy facial expressions was observed in the bilateral amygdala , cingulate and right medial frontal gyrus following escitalopram medication .
26645207|In accordance with previous data , we showed that escitalopram exerts its rapid direct effect on emotional processing via attenuation of neural activation in pathways involving medial frontal gyrus and amygdala , an effect that seems to be distinguishable from that of other SSRIs .
26645274|Evidence from functional neuroimaging studies of emotional perception shows that when attention is focused on external features of emotional stimuli -LRB- external perceptual orienting-EPO -RRB- , the amygdala is primarily engaged , but when attention is turned inwards towards one 's own emotional state -LRB- interoceptive self-orienting-ISO -RRB- , regions of the salience network , such as the anterior insula -LRB- AI -RRB- and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- dACC -RRB- , also play a major role .
26645274|The study yielded three main findings : -LRB- i -RRB- emotion boosted perception-related activity in the amygdala during both ISO and EPO and in the right AI exclusively during ISO ; -LRB- ii -RRB- emotion augmented activity predicting subsequent memory in AI and dACC during ISO but not during EPO and -LRB- iii -RRB- high confidence memory was associated with increased amygdala-dACC connectivity , selectively for ISO encoding .
26650724|RESULTS : Youths with CP had decreased GMV in the left amygdala -LRB- SDM estimate = -0.218 ; P < .001 -RRB- -LRB- extending into anterior insula -RRB- , right insula -LRB- SDM estimate = -0.174 ; P < .001 -RRB- -LRB- extending ventrolaterally into the prefrontal cortex and inferiorly into the superior temporal gyrus -RRB- , left medial superior frontal gyrus -LRB- SDM estimate = -0.163 ; P = .001 -RRB- -LRB- extending into the right anterior cingulate cortex -RRB- , and left fusiform gyrus -LRB- SDM estimate = -0.146 ; P = .003 -RRB- .
26650724|Subgroup meta-analysis assessing age-at-onset effects identified reduced GMV in the left anterior insula -LRB- SDM estimate = -0.232 ; P < .001 -RRB- -LRB- extending into amygdala -RRB- .
26650724|The proportion of male and female youths in the sample was associated with decreased GMV in the left amygdala -LRB- SDM estimate = -0.31 ; P < .001 -RRB- and increased GMV in the right inferior temporal cortex -LRB- SDM estimate = 0.755 ; P < .001 -RRB- .
26650724|While there was no association with comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or IQ , age range was associated with gray matter differences in the left amygdala .
26650724|CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE : We identified gray matter reductions within the insula , amygdala , frontal and temporal regions in youths with CP as well as inconsistencies in sample characteristics across studies that should be addressed in future research .
26654176|OBJECT The objectives of this study were to describe a novel minimal-access subtemporal approach for selective resection of the amygdala and hippocampus in patients with medically refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy -LRB- MTLE -RRB- due to hippocampal sclerosis , and to analyze the related outcomes .
26670947|RESULTS : During processing of fear and anger faces , greater amygdala and less right dorsolateral prefrontal -LRB- dlPFC -RRB- activation partially mediated the positive relationship between CEM and anxiety symptoms .
26680151|-LSB- Epub ahead of print -RSB- Postpartum depression and brain response to infants : Differential amygdala response and connectivity .
26680151|Recent evidence suggests that postpartum depression is associated with reduced amygdala -LRB- AMY -RRB- response to negative stimuli .
26682467|Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies link this symptom to aberrant functional connectivity between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex .
26682467|Seed-based analyses were conducted to quantify brain changes in functional connectivity with the right and left amygdala .
26682467|RESULTS : Before induction , patients showed relatively lower connectivity between the right amygdala and right superior frontal gyrus , right paracingulate/anterior cingulate cortex , and right supramarginal gyrus than control subjects .
26682467|Moreover , decreases in functional connectivity between the left amygdala and subgenual cingulate cortex and between the right amygdala and caudate nucleus predicted the magnitude of reduction in heart rate variability after induction .
26709994|As a functionally central structure between amygdala , basal ganglia , mesolimbic dopaminergic regions , mediodorsal thalamus and prefrontal cortex , the nucleus accumbens appears to play a modulative role in the flow of the information from the amygdaloid complex to these regions .
26709994|Dopamine is a major neurotransmitter of the nucleus accumbens and this nucleus has a modulative function to the amygdala-basal ganglia-prefrontal cortex circuit .
26709994|Together with the prefrontal cortex and amygdala , nucleus accumbens consists a part of the cerebral circuit which regulates functions associated with effort .
26711494|Although a central role for the amygdala is well established -LSB- 4 -RSB- , both human and animal studies implicate other brain regions in learning , notably ventral striatum and cerebellum -LSB- 5 -RSB- .
26711494|The associated learning signals-the learned associability and prediction error-were correlated with fMRI brain responses in amygdala-striatal regions , corresponding to the classic aversive -LRB- fear -RRB- learning circuit .
26714574|The rMDD group additionally showed BOLD activity during F-A in numerous regions , including the bilateral paracingulate gyri , middle temporal gyri and right amygdala .
26741286|We investigated OT administration effects on subjective anxiety and functional connectivity of basolateral -LRB- BLA -RRB- and centromedial -LRB- CeM -RRB- amygdala subregions with prefrontal and salience processing areas .
26741286|Although caution is warranted , our findings tentatively suggest that OT has the potential to diminish anxiety and fear expression of the amygdala in PTSD , either via increased control of the vmPFC over the CeM -LRB- males -RRB- or via decreased salience processing of the dACC and BLA -LRB- females -RRB- .
26742068|In the fasting-state , visual food stimuli elicited significant responses in the bilateral insula and amygdala and left orbitofrontal cortex .
26743811|MRI images were subjected to volume-based analysis -LRB- VBA -RRB- and surface-based analysis -LRB- SBA -RRB- in the whole brain as well as ROI-based analysis of the lateral geniculate nucleus -LRB- LGN -RRB- , visual cortex -LRB- V1/2 -RRB- , amygdala and hippocampus .
26743811|While VBA showed no significant differences in the gray matter volumes of patients , SBA revealed significantly reduced cortical thickness in the right frontal pole and ROI-based analysis volume shrinkage in LGN bilaterally , right V1 and left amygdala .
26749205|Moreover , significant positive correlations were found between re-experiencing symptoms and response within the amygdala , and between hyper-arousal symptoms and response within the periaqueductal gray matter , during subliminal processing of trauma-related words and during supraliminal processing of fearful faces , respectively .
26751483|Right S1 activity also correlated with individual differences in both primary auditory cortices -LRB- A1 -RRB- and amygdala activity .
26759791|Across the GAD group , increased right amygdala volume was associated with prolonged reaction times on the tracking task -LRB- indicating increased attentional impairment following the induction -RRB- and lower scores on the ` Act with awareness ' subscale of the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire .
26770059|We used a seed-based correlation approach concerning two brain circuits including the affective network and the DMN , with two seed regions including the bilateral amygdala for the limbic network and the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex -LRB- PCC -RRB- for the DMN .
26770059|RESULTS : The disrup-MDD participants showed lower RSFC from the amygdala to the orbitofrontal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus compared to HC participants .
26770059|Depression scores in disrup-MDD participants were negatively correlated with RSFC from the amygdala to the right orbitofrontal cortex .
26770836|Our investigation revealed three main findings : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the small-worldness was persistent after ECT series ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- anatomical connections changes were found in limbic structure , temporal and frontal lobes , in which the connection changes between amygdala and parahippocampus correlate with depressive symptom reduction ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- significant nodal strength changes were found in right paralimbic network .
26771739|Using functional MRI , the authors examined whole brain resting-state functional connectivity with the left and right hippocampus and amygdala .
26771739|RESULTS : Lower income-to-needs ratio at preschool age was associated with reduced connectivity between hippocampus and amygdala and a number of regions at school age , including the superior frontal cortex , lingual gyrus , posterior cingulate , and putamen .
26771739|Lower income-to-needs ratio predicted greater negative mood/depression severity at school age , as did connectivity between the left hippocampus and the right superior frontal cortex and between the right amygdala and the right lingual gyrus .
26771739|CONCLUSIONS : These findings suggest that poverty in early childhood , as assessed by at least one measure , may influence the development of hippocampal and amygdala connectivity in a manner leading to negative mood symptoms during later childhood .
26778996|Emotion-related areas of the brain , such as the medial frontal cortices , amygdala , and striatum , are activated during listening to sad or happy music as well as during listening to pleasurable music .
26778996|The cortico-thalamo-striatal reward circuit and motor areas were more active during liked than disliked music , whereas only the auditory cortex and the right amygdala were more active for disliked over liked music .
26779109|The anterior medial temporal lobe -LRB- TL -RRB- , including the amygdala , has been implicated in olfactory processing , e.g. , coding for intensity and valence , and seems also involved in memory .
26780113|The current study examined the relationship between amygdala activity and negative affect measured concurrently and approximately 12 months later in preschool-age children .
26780113|RESULTS : Negative affect at baseline was positively correlated with right amygdala activity to sad faces , right amygdala activity to happy faces , and left amygdala activity to happy faces .
26780113|Right amygdala activity to sad faces also positively predicted parent-reported negative affect 12 months later even when negative affect reported at baseline was controlled .
26780113|CONCLUSIONS : The current findings provide preliminary evidence for amygdala activity as a potential biomarker of persistent negative affect during early childhood and suggest future work examining the origins and long-term implications of this relationship is necessary .

26781519|SCC connectivity was investigated with closely connected bilateral a priori regions of interest -LRB- ROIs -RRB- relevant to MDD -LRB- anterior temporal , ventromedial prefrontal , dorsomedial prefrontal cortices , amygdala , hippocampus , septal region , and hypothalamus -RRB- .
26781519|Decreased -LRB- less positive -RRB- SCC connectivity with the right parahippocampal gyrus and left amygdala distinguished melancholic rMDD patients from the nonmelancholic rMDD and HC groups -LRB- cluster-based familywise error-corrected p ? 0.007 over individual a priori ROIs corresponding to approximate Bonferroni-corrected p ? 0.05 across all seven a priori ROIs -RRB- .

26784396|Episode-independent effects were observed between the left PCC and the right dorsolateral PFC , as well as between the left amygdala and right insula and caudate , whereas the burden of multiple episodes was associated with hypoconnectivity of the left PCC to multiple cognitive control regions as well as hypoconnectivity of the amygdala to large portions of the SN .

26803059|The experimental paradigm applied a well-established ToM cartoon task to test functional effects of EFE on the activation of the amygdala and the anterior ToM network during affective ToM judgments .
26803059|The presence of EFE during affective ToM judgments was associated with shorter reaction times as well as increased activation of the right amygdala , most probably located in the basolateral nucleus -LRB- BLA -RRB- , coincident with reduced activation of ToM-related regions of the prefrontal cortex .
26803059|In combination with the functional interaction of EFE and affective ToM in the right amygdala , our data suggest a complementary but parallel organization of EFE processing and affective ToM .
26803059|In this framework , the amygdala seems to act as an EFE detector when affective ToM judgments are demanded .
26803059|Additionally , the facts that EFE induced exclusively right-sided amygdala activation and modulated the connectivity with the contralateral ToM network support the idea of a functional lateralization of stimulus driven components of affective ToM .
26805508|Reduced covariation bias was predicted by connectivity between PCL and PFC. In response to spider pictures , the amygdala was functionally connected to somatosensory and visual areas .
26809288|Results demonstrate the existence of a wide network of areas underpinning moral reasoning , including orbitofrontal cortex , insula , amygdala , anterior cingulate cortex as well as precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex .
26809288|Within this network we found a neural segregation as a function of the personal perspective , with 1PP eliciting higher activation in the bilateral insula and superior temporal gyrus as well as in the anterior cingulate cortex , lingual and fusiform gyri , middle temporal gyrus and precentral gyrus in the left hemisphere , and 3PP eliciting higher activation in the bilateral amygdala , the posterior cingulate cortex , insula and supramarginal gyrus in the left hemisphere as well as the medial and ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the right hemisphere .
26813705|RESULTS : Voxel-based whole-brain interaction analysis revealed three large clusters -LRB- FWE-corrected -RRB- of reduced GM volumes comprising the bilateral insula , the superior and middle temporal gyrus , the bilateral hippocampus , the right amygdala , and the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex in abused TT carriers .
26813705|In region of interest analyses , highly significant volume reductions in the right hippocampus/parahippocampus , the bilateral anterior and middle cingulate cortex , the insula , and the amygdala were confirmed in abused TT carriers compared with abused CT/CC carriers .
26814280|A previous study from our laboratory demonstrated a dosage-correlated volumetric decrease in the right amygdala of participants administered oral morphine daily for 1 month .

26821063|Adult functional neuroimaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- studies have demonstrated associations between restricted sleep and neural alterations in the amygdala and reward circuitry when viewing emotional picture and face stimuli .
26821063|Maternal reported child sleep duration was negatively associated with -LRB- a -RRB- activation in the bilateral amygdala , left insula , and left temporal pole activation when viewing negative -LRB- i.e. , fearful , disgust -RRB- vs. neutral faces , -LRB- b -RRB- right orbitofrontal and bilateral prefrontal activation when viewing disgust vs. neutral faces , and -LRB- c -RRB- bilateral orbitofrontal , right anterior cingulate , and left amygdala activation when viewing happy vs. neutral faces .
26821063|Consistent with our prediction , we also noted that emotion-dependent functional connectivity between the bilateral amygdala and prefrontal cortex , cingulate , fusiform , and occipital cortex was positively associated with sleep duration .
26821063|Paralleling similar studies in adults , these findings collectively suggest that decreased sleep duration in school-aged children may contribute to enhanced reactivity of brain regions involved in emotion and reward processing , as well as decreased emotion-dependent functional connectivity between the amygdala and brain regions associated with emotion regulation .
26823966|METHODS : We collected resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- data , tailored to provide optimal sensitivity in the amygdala as well as the neocortex , in 20 adolescents and young adults with ASD and 25 matched controls .
26823966|We performed a regular correlation analysis between the entire amygdala -LRB- EA -RRB- and the whole brain and used a partial correlation analysis to investigate whole-brain functional connectivity uniquely related to each of the amygdaloid subregions .
26824403|-LSB- Epub ahead of print -RSB- Hippocampus and amygdala volumes from magnetic resonance images in children : Assessing accuracy of FreeSurfer and FSL against manual segmentation .
26824403|In this study , we examined the accuracy and consistency of those two automated protocols relative to manual segmentation , commonly considered as the `` gold standard '' technique , for estimating hippocampus and amygdala volumes in a sample of preadolescent children aged between 6 to 11years .
26824403|Results highlighted a tendency for both automated techniques to overestimate hippocampus and amygdala volumes , in comparison to manual segmentation .
26824403|This was more pronounced when using FreeSurfer than FSL-FIRST and , for both techniques , the overestimation was more marked for the amygdala than the hippocampus .
26824403|Pearson correlations support moderate associations between manual tracing and FreeSurfer for hippocampus -LRB- right r = 0.69 , p < 0.001 ; left r = 0.77 , p < 0.001 -RRB- and amygdala -LRB- right r = 0.61 , p < 0.001 ; left r = 0.67 , p < 0.001 -RRB- volumes .
26824403|Correlation coefficients between manual segmentation and FSL-FIRST were statistically significant -LRB- right hippocampus r = 0.59 , p < 0.001 ; left hippocampus r = 0.51 , p < 0.001 ; right amygdala r = 0.35 , p < 0.001 ; left amygdala r = 0.31 , p < 0.001 -RRB- but were significantly weaker , for all investigated structures .
26824403|When looking at each method separately , correlations between left and right hemispheric volumes showed strong associations between bilateral hippocampus and bilateral amygdala volumes when assessed using manual segmentation or FreeSurfer .
26824403|These results demonstrate that , at least in a pediatric population , the agreement between amygdala and hippocampus volumes obtained with automated FSL-FIRST and FreeSurfer protocols and those obtained with manual segmentation is not strong .
26826874|At-risk children also exhibited 1 -RRB- hypoconnectivity within the cognitive control network , which also lacked the typical anticorrelation with the default mode network ; 2 -RRB- hypoconnectivity between left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex ; and 3 -RRB- hyperconnectivity between the right amygdala and right inferior frontal gyrus , a key region for top-down modulation of emotion .
26832606|Perceiving others being harmed was associated with increased hemodynamic activity in the left amygdala and right temporoparietal junction -LRB- rTPJ -RRB- .
26832606|Children with higher callous traits showed less functional connectivity seeded in anterior cingulate with left amygdala and anterior insula .
26834598|When participants were hungry and tasted calories from the simple solution , brain activation in the right ventral striatum -LRB- caudate -RRB- , right amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- bilaterally -RRB- correlated negatively with BAS drive scores .
26834606|In chronic pain , a number of brain regions involved in emotion -LRB- e.g. , amygdala , hippocampus , nucleus accumbens , insula , anterior cingulate , and prefrontal cortex -RRB- show significant functional and morphometric changes .
26834606|Additionally , increased PRF levels were associated with decreased activity in a number of brain regions including the right amygdala , insula , putamen , and caudate .
26842987|Sham treatment -LRB- compared with baseline -RRB- reduced FC between the VPL thalamus , S1 , and the amygdala .
26843002|Compared with non-smokers , young smokers showed reduced RSFC between right AI and anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- VMPFC -RRB- , amygdala , left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , and dorsal striatum .
26844811|Specifically , the increase in connectivity with the contralateral fusiform gyrus , the hippocampus , the amygdala and the inferior frontal gyrus correlated with recognition memory performance .
26845282|RESULTS : We found that treatment response of psychotic symptoms to risperidone in antipsychotic-nave AD patients was positively associated with both left and right putamina , left parahippocampal gyrus , and left amygdala volume after controlling covariates of no interest -LRB- uncorrected P < .001 , KE > 100 voxels -RRB- .
26845282|CONCLUSIONS : Therefore , we conclude that gray matter volumes of putamina , left parahippocampal gyrus , and left amygdala are associated with treatment response of psychotic symptoms after 6 weeks of treatment with risperidone in antipsychotic-nave AD patients with psychosis .
26846227|Both the meta-analytic and narrative reviews showed evidence of smaller brain structures and lower brain activity in individuals with ODD/CD in mainly hot EF-related areas : bilateral amygdala , bilateral insula , right striatum , left medial/superior frontal gyrus , and left precuneus .
26846227|There is strong evidence that abnormalities in the amygdala are specific for ODD/CD as compared to ADHD , and correlational studies further support the association between abnormalities in the amygdala and ODD/CD symptoms .
26852326|This analysis revealed greater atrophy than hypometabolism in the right putamen and amygdala , and left insula and superior temporal gyrus , whereas hypometabolism was more severe than GM atrophy in the left caudate nucleus and anterior cingulate cortex .
26852326|Finally , GM atrophy affected the right amygdala/hippocampus and left insula in 95 % of the patients .
26858620|Our results showed that the correlations between BIS score and GMV of the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- dmPFC -RRB- , the bilateral insula and the orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- , the right amygdala and the left fusiform gyrus decreased in the IGD group compared to the HCs .
26859310|Abnormal functional architecture of amygdala-centered networks in adolescent posttraumatic stress disorder .
26859310|Whereas multiple lines of research implicate amygdala-centered network dysfunction in the pathophysiology of adult PTSD , no study has yet examined the functional architecture of amygdala subregional networks in adolescent PTSD .
26859310|Using intrinsic functional connectivity analysis , we investigated functional connectivity of the basolateral -LRB- BLA -RRB- and centromedial -LRB- CMA -RRB- amygdala in 19 sexually abused adolescents with PTSD relative to 23 matched controls .
26859310|Additionally , we examined whether altered amygdala subregional connectivity coincides with abnormal grey matter volume of the amygdaloid complex .
26859310|Our analysis revealed abnormal amygdalar connectivity and morphology in adolescent PTSD patients .
26859310|These findings provide unique insights into how perturbations in major amygdalar circuits could hamper fear regulation and drive excessive acquisition and expression of fear in PTSD .
26859312|Lifespan anxiety is reflected in human amygdala cortical connectivity .
26859312|The amygdala plays a pivotal role in processing anxiety and connects to large-scale brain networks .
26859312|However , intrinsic functional connectivity -LRB- iFC -RRB- between amygdala and these networks has rarely been examined in relation to anxiety , especially across the lifespan .
26859312|We employed resting-state functional MRI data from 280 healthy adults -LRB- 18-83 .5 yrs -RRB- to elucidate the relationship between anxiety and amygdala iFC with common cortical networks including the visual network , somatomotor network , dorsal attention network , ventral attention network , limbic network , frontoparietal network , and default network .
26859312|Global and network-specific iFC were separately computed as mean iFC of amygdala with the entire cerebral cortex and each cortical network .
26859312|We detected negative correlation between global positive amygdala iFC and trait anxiety .
26859312|Network-specific associations between amygdala iFC and anxiety were also detectable .
26859312|Specifically , the higher iFC strength between the left amygdala and the limbic network predicted lower state anxiety .
26859312|For the trait anxiety , left amygdala anxiety-connectivity correlation was observed in both somatomotor and dorsal attention networks , whereas the right amygdala anxiety-connectivity correlation was primarily distributed in the frontoparietal and ventral attention networks .
26859312|Ventral attention network exhibited significant anxiety-gender interactions on its iFC with amygdala .
26859312|Together with findings from additional vertex-wise analysis , these data clearly indicated that both low-level sensory networks and high-level associative networks could contribute to detectable predictions of anxiety behaviors by their iFC profiles with the amygdala .
26865423|Depression is linked to increased amygdala activation to neutral and negatively valenced facial expressions .
26865423|Studies are needed to examine how amygdala reactivity relates to the course of depressive symptoms dimensionally , prospectively , and in populations diverse in gender , race and socioeconomic status .156 men from predominately low-income backgrounds completed an fMRI task where they viewed emotional facial expressions .
26865423|Left and right amygdala reactivity to neutral , but not angry or fearful , facial expressions relative to a non-face baseline at age 20 predicted greater depressive symptoms two years later , controlling for age 20 depressive symptoms.Heightened bilateral amygdala reactivity to neutral facial expressions predicted increases in depressive symptoms two years later in a large community sample .
26865423|Individual differences in amygdala reactivity to neutral facial expressions appear to identify those at most risk for a more problematic course of depressive symptoms across time .
26867078|However , across the three neuroimaging tasks , giving but not receiving support was related to reduced stress-related activity -LRB- dorsal anterior cingulate cortex -LSB- r = -0.27 -RSB- , left -LSB- r = -0.28 -RSB- and right anterior insula -LSB- r = -0.33 -RSB- , and left -LSB- r = -0.32 -RSB- and right amygdala -LSB- r = -0.32 -RSB- -RRB- to a stress task , greater reward-related activity -LRB- left -LSB- r = 0.42 -RSB- and right ventral striatum -LSB- VS ; r = 0.41 -RSB- -RRB- to an affiliative task , and greater caregiving-related activity -LRB- left VS -LSB- r = 0.31 -RSB- , right VS -LSB- r = 0.31 -RSB- , and septal area -LSB- r = 0.39 -RSB- -RRB- to a prosocial task .
26892030|No significant results were found in the amygdala during uncertain cue processing .
26892860|Second , striatum and amygdala activations increased by the competition with familiar friends were significantly correlated with the increased ratings of pleasantness , which reflected emotionally positive feelings in victory for the competition with familiar opponents .
26896742|Functional connectivity analysis was employed with a left -LRB- L -RRB- amygdala seed and a right interior frontal gyrus -LRB- R IFG -RRB- target .
26896742|RESULTS : Changes in functional connectivity with emotion regulation and treatment were linearly related to 5-HTTLPR ` L' allele load such that negative R IFG-L amygdala connectivity was increased with an increasing number of ` L' alleles .
2724964|In autoradiograms of brain , most of the labeled neurons were in the hypothalamus , preoptic area and amygdala .
2727137|The question of a population hemispheric asymmetery in initial seizure sensitivity and in rate of kindling in the amygdala was examined in an unbiased sample of 80 rats studied in our laboratory during the past six years .
2727137|Afterdischarge threshold , initial and final afterdischarge duration , and kindling rate were the same in rats kindled in the left or right basolateral amygdala .
2727137|The results suggest that there is no systematic difference between the hemispheres in initial seizure sensitivity or rate of amygdala kindling .
2760629|Concentrations of the polyamines putrescine , spermidine , and spermine were investigated in the left and right amygdala and in the remaining cerebrum , in which kindling was induced by repeated application of electrical stimulation of the left amygdala of rats .
2765167|It was found that certain structures -LRB- e.g. the ventral portion of the claustrum , the insula with its extension ventrally into the fundus , nucleus Medialis dorsalis and nucleus Pulvinar oralis -RRB- repeatedly , whereas others -LRB- e.g. the amygdala -RRB- never gave rise to significant outcomes .
2765943|In addition , other memory-related structures -LRB- prefrontal cortex , dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus , amygdala and hippocampus -RRB- showed a similar increase in 2-DG uptake compared to control monkeys , though their respective absolute values were different from one another .
2827290|Neuropathological examination showed atrophy -LRB- neuronal loss , protoplasmic gliosis -RRB- in the amygdala ; where there was in addition an area of nodular gliosis .
2869434|Laterality of dopamine function and neuroleptic action in the amygdala in the rat .
2869434|Dopamine was persistently infused into the central area of the left or right amygdala of animals showing left or right hemispheric dominance .
2869434|Dopamine caused marked and consistent hyperactivity only when infused into the left amygdala when the right hemisphere was dominant .
2869434|Both -LRB- - -RRB- sulpiride and fluphenazine , injected unilaterally into the amygdala , antagonised the hyperactivity caused by infusion of dopamine into the left amygdala in animals with right hemispheric dominance .
2869434|This antagonism could be effected both from the infused amygdala -LSB- 5-50 pg -LRB- - -RRB- sulpiride , 25-100 pg fluphenazine -RSB- and from the contralateral amygdala -LSB- 100-250 pg -LRB- - -RRB- sulpiride , 25-100 pg fluphenazine -RSB- .
2869434|Thus , a laterality was shown for the action of dopamine in the amygdala of the rat .
2869434|In contrast , neuroleptic agents failed to show an exclusive laterality of action , but were able to act in either hemisphere to antagonise the effects of dopamine injected into the left amygdala .

2996714|Manaker S , Caine SB , Winokur A. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone -LRB- TRH -RRB- receptor densities in the amygdala were examined with quantitative autoradiography in rats treated with the cellular neurotoxin ibotenic acid -LRB- IBO -RRB- .
2996714|Our results strongly suggest that TRH receptors in the amygdala are predominantly located on cell bodies .
3085869|Unilateral peri-substantia nigra catecholaminergic lesion and amygdala kindling .
3085869|Our data suggest that the facilitation of amygdala kindling observed following 6-OHDA lesion in the vicinity of the ipsilateral SN is due to norepinephrine depletion of the ipsilateral forebrain .

3122067|Testosterone is converted to estradiol in specific regions of the primate brain and accumulates as such in the nuclei of cells in hypothalamus , preoptic area , and amygdala .
3122067|Compared with the 4 control animals , nuclear levels of -LSB- 3H -RSB- - estradiol in testosterone-treated males were reduced by 77 % in the hypothalamus -LRB- p less than 0.001 -RRB- , by 93 % in the preoptic area -LRB- p less than 0.001 -RRB- , and by 90 % in the amygdala -LRB- p less than 0.05 -RRB- .
3135200|The electrical activity recordings of sensorimotor cortex -LRB- SMC -RRB- , visual cortex , and right and left amygdalae revealed progressive changes as naloxone was administered : -LRB- A -RRB- slow spindle activity -LRB- 4-6 Hz -RRB- in SMC , -LRB- B -RRB- 12 Hz rhythmic activity in both amygdalae , -LRB- C -RRB- generalized paroxysms , and -LRB- D -RRB- spontaneous tonic-clonic electrographic seizures .
3188639|In situation of competition of probability and value of reinforcement , some different aspects of animals typology appeared , presumably connected with individual characteristics of functioning of four brain structures as a basis of types of higher nervous activity -LRB- frontal cortex , hippocampus , amygdala , hypothalamus -RRB- .

3197689|The data suggest that since amygdala kindling does not produce any consistent , long-lasting alterations in brain regional NE glycol metabolite levels , there are no consistent , long-term changes in central NE neuronal activity .
3197695|An experimental limbic seizure was induced in cats by microinjection of kainic acid into the left amygdala .
3197695|Immediately after the development of continuous multiple spikes , rCBF increased about 2-fold in the left amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- and remained so during the seizure .
3197695|When continuous multiple spikes were transmitted to the left hippocampus -LRB- LH -RRB- , rCBF in the LH increased to 140 % of the baseline value , but in the right amygdala -LRB- RA -RRB- and left sensorimotor cortex -LRB- LCx -RRB- it remained unchanged .
3208068|The bilateral distribution and overall amplitude of the P300 component of the event-related brain potential -LRB- ERP -RRB- was studied in epileptic patients in whom the amygdala , hippocampal , and anterior temporal lobe areas of the brain had been resected unilaterally .

3260462|At autopsy in 1 patient , the infarct was nearly limited to the deep white matter of the temporal isthmus and the retrolenticular part of the internal capsule ; only minute lesions were present in the globus pallidus , body of caudate , and amygdala .
3295918|After a brief review of results reported so far regarding the stereotactic treatment of seizures , the author describes the results achieved with eight patients on whom stereotactic coagulation was performed in the right or left amygdala-hippocampus complex between 1976 and 1983 on account of drug-resistant partial seizures .
3349969|This spontaneous phenomenon has only rarely been reported in the epilepsy literature but has been reported to be evoked by electrical stimulation of the right amygdala .
3401735|In control males , labeled neurons were observed in preoptic area , hypothalamus and amygdala .
3401735|In hypothalamus , preoptic area and amygdala , EB-pretreatment reduced nuclear concentrations of -LSB- 3H -RSB- estradiol to 37-55 % of control levels , but reduced neither the nuclear concentrations of -LSB- 3H -RSB- testosterone nor the supernatant concentrations of -LSB- 3H -RSB- estradiol and -LSB- 3H -RSB- testosterone .
3401735|The data suggest that the actions of testosterone in regions such as the arcuate nucleus and lateral septal nucleus primarily involve unchanged testosterone or dihydrotestosterone , while in regions such as the amygdala , aromatization and interaction with estrogen receptors is involved also .
3502060|Asymmetry of the metabolic rate of the amygdala in hebephrenic patients was the opposite of that found in paranoid patients and controls .
3504393|Deep prepiriform cortex kindling and amygdala interactions .
3504393|We investigated the susceptibility of the DPC to the development of electrical kindling as compared to that of the superficial prepiriform cortex -LRB- SPC -RRB- and amygdala as well as the transfer interactions between the two prepiriform sites and amygdala .
3504393|Adult rats with electrodes implanted in the right prepiriform cortex -LRB- DPC or SPC -RRB- and left amygdala were divided into a DPC-amygdala and SPC-amygdala group while a third group consisted of rats with electrodes implanted in the ipsilateral DPC and amygdala .
3504393|Both DPC and SPC were as sensitive to the development of kindling as the amygdala .
3504393|The behavioral seizures elicited with DPC or SPC primary kindling were identical to those induced by amygdala kindling .
3504393|Initial DPC kindling facilitated the development of kindling from either ipsilateral or contralateral amygdala with the ipsilateral transfer being significantly more potent than the contralateral .
3504393|SPC kindling also facilitated the development of contralateral amygdala kindling but was less effective than DPC kindling .
3504393|On the other hand , amygdala kindling did not facilitate contralateral SPC or DPC kindling although it transferred to the ipsilateral DPC .
3504393|These results indicate that the prepiriform cortex can be readily kindled but not faster than the amygdala and that there are unequal kindling transfer interactions between prepiriform cortex and amygdala .
3567602|Limbic system nuclei including the amygdala , bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and substantia innominata had relatively high concentrations of both SLI and NPYLI .
3582288|At age 16 days , male rats were electrically kindled in the right amygdala -LRB- AM -RRB- .
3668238|A multivariate analysis showed that the amygdaloid complex is asymmetrical between the hemispheres , with the lateral nucleus of the amygdala , which is larger in the right hemisphere , showing the strongest volumetric asymmetry .
3668238|These findings are discussed in relation to the amygdala 's role as a mediator between limbic and cortical processing , and in light of the right hemisphere 's specialization for emotional behaviors .
3724987|Previous studies have shown that -LSB- 3H -RSB- estradiol is the major nuclear metabolite of -LSB- 3H -RSB- testosterone in the hypothalamus , preoptic area and amygdala of the male rhesus monkey , and it has been proposed that some of the stimulatory effects of testosterone on male sexual behavior may be mediated by estradiol-concentrating neurons .
3724987|Brain areas previously shown to contain labeled neurons after -LSB- 3H -RSB- testosterone administration were also labeled after -LSB- 3H -RSB- estradiol , including medial preoptic nucleus -LRB- n. -RRB- , anterior hypothalamic area , bed n. of stria terminalis , ventromedial n. , premammillary n. , and corticomedial amygdala .
3724987|In the brain , the highest nuclear concentration of -LSB- 3H -RSB- estradiol was in the hypothalamus -LRB- 249.2 + / - 20.0 fmol/mg DNA -RRB- , although in the previous experiments with -LSB- 3H -RSB- testosterone , the highest nuclear concentrations of -LSB- 3H -RSB- estradiol were found in the amygdala .
3730193|Electrodes were implanted in the dorsal hippocampus , the lateral amygdala and the cortical surface -LRB- frontal and occipital -RRB- of the right hemisphere under the intraperitoneal pentobarbital administration .
3730193|One or two week after implantation of the electrodes , the left cerebral hemisphere was totally ectomized in a block including the subcortical structures such as amygdala , hippocampus , thalamus and hypothalamus down to the colliculus superior .
3730193|One month following the left hemispherectomy , the cats were electrically stimulated daily at the after-discharge threshold intensity in the right lateral amygdala .
3768667|Growth hormone release induced by electrical stimulation of the basolateral amygdala , observed in pentobarbital anesthetized rats .
3768667|The aim of this study was to clarify the neural pathway leading to the growth hormone -LRB- GH -RRB- release when the basolateral amygdala -LRB- ABL -RRB- was electrically stimulated .
3780907|Following spontaneous offset of the nonconvulsive status epilepticus , minor pathology occurred which was largely restricted to the hippocampus , whereas partial or generalized status epilepticus produced considerable bilateral damage in the hippocampus , basolateral amygdala , and pyriform cortex .
3929317|Injections of 0.06-2 micrograms apomorphine or dopamine into the nucleus accumbens , central area of the amygdala , septum or ventral tegmental nucleus caused dose-dependent motor inhibition with maximal reductions in the order of 60-70 % of control value .
3947996|The volume of the medial nucleus of the amygdala was determined in the right and in the left hemispheres in 17 human brains ranging in age from 35 weeks of gestation to 94 years of age .
3947996|This finding is discussed in relation to evidence for sexual dimorphism in the medial nucleus of the amygdala in animal brains .
4029337|At 80 days of age , a bipolar electrode was placed either in the right basolateral amygdala or the right angular bundle of entorhinal cortex .
4029337|Similar results were obtained in both amygdala and angular bundle kindling experiments .
4039950|Injection of ferric chloride -LRB- FC -RRB- into the left amygdala of rats produced limbic seizures that lasted at least 3 weeks .
4039950|In FC-injected animals challenged weekly with apomorphine for 3 weeks , increases in the -LSB- 3H -RSB- - spiperone Bmax in both amygdalae , the left nucleus accumbens , and the right nucleus caudatus and increases in Kd in the left amygdala and right nucleus accumbens were noted .
487201|The possibility of activating the caudate nucleus inhibitory effects through the amygdala during internal inhibition phenomena is discussed .
6092546|Benzodiazepine receptor binding following amygdala-kindled convulsions : differing results in washed and unwashed brain membranes .
6092546|The binding of -LSB- 3H -RSB- flunitrazepam and -LSB- 3H -RSB- RO5-4864 was measured in unwashed brain homogenates and in extensively washed brain membranes from amygdala-kindled and `` yoked '' control rats sacrificed 2 weeks following the sixth stage 5 convulsion .
6092546|In washed brain membranes , -LSB- 3H -RSB- flunitrazepam binding was unaltered in these regions ; it was bilaterally elevated , however , in both the amygdala and hippocampus -LRB- unchanged in other areas -RRB- .
6141046|Clonidine microinjection into the amygdala nucleus had no effect on GH release , while the injection into the preoptic and anterior hypothalamic area -LRB- PO/AH -RRB- significantly stimulated GH release by causing it to begin 30 min earlier .
6177503|Following KA doses of 0.8-2 .0 micrograms , 4 distinct phases were observed : -LRB- 1 -RRB- acute phase which lasted 1-2 days and corresponded to the pattern of repetitive seizures as already described ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- silent phase -LRB- 5-21 days -RRB- which was characterized by a progressive return to apparently normal EEG and behaviour except for some aggressive behaviour in those animals receiving the highest doses ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- phase of spontaneous recurrent seizures -LRB- these seizures started 6-22 days after KA injections and were mostly triggered upon handling and recurred approximately 2 times by day for about 30 days ; usually they resembled the amygdaloid kindled seizures -RRB- ; and -LRB- 4 -RRB- post-seizure phase where no more seizures were observed but significant spiking activity in the amygdala recordings could be seen .
6312371|However , in the olfactory bulb , the anterior olfactory nucleus , the olfactory tubercle , the nucleus accumbens , caudate-putamen , central nucleus of the amygdala , nucleus interstitialis striae terminalis , pre-lateral mamillary nuclei , ventral hypothalamus , hippocampus , peri-aqueductal grey and the granular layer of the cerebellum , cells were stained by the heptapeptide antiserum but not the Met-enkephalin antiserum .
6312371|The two antisera revealed similar patterns of staining of nerve fibres in many regions including hypothalamus , central nucleus of the amygdala , lateral septum , thalamus , mid-brain and spinal cord .
6315779|The following subcortical structures were found to project to area 17 and/or area 18 : locus coeruleus , dorsal raphe nucleus , nucleus annularis , nucleus centralis superior , pontine reticular formation , mesencephalic reticular formation , dorsal hypothalamus , lateral hypothalamus , nucleus basalis of Meynert , nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca , claustrum , nucleus basalis lateralis amygdalae , lateral geniculate nucleus , inferior pulvinar , lateral pulvinar , nucleus limitans , medial magnocellular part of the nucleus ventralis anterior , nucleus paracentralis , and nucleus centralis medialis thalami .
6489500|Our results indicate that Long-Evans male rats housed in standard conditions show no significant difference between the areas of sections of their left and right amygdalas .
6489500|In contrast , the S1 strain maze-bright animals have a significantly greater right amygdala than left .
6489500|Furthermore , the data indicate an overall increase in mean -LRB- R + L -RRB- / 2 amygdala area from 6 to 400 days , except for a significant decrease in area from 26 to 90 days .
6669327|Neuropsychiatric investigation revealed developmental lags in speech and other psychosocial skills and , on computer tomography , a circumscribed lesion -LRB- cystic defect -RRB- lateral to the right nucleus amygdalae .
6723589|Daily stimulation of 60 Hz -LRB- rectangular wave , 1 ms in duration , 500 microA in peak current , 2-s train -RRB- was given to the right amygdala , for kindling .
6726244|The phosphorylation of both particulate and soluble proteins in the amygdala was examined in electrically kindled rats .
6726244|In animals receiving electrical stimulation in the left amygdala for 5-6 days that displayed electrical after-discharges but no motor seizures , no changes were observed in the phosphorylation of either particulate or soluble proteins .
6726244|The phosphorylation of this protein was increased in both the right -LRB- unstimulated -RRB- and left -LRB- stimulated -RRB- amygdala .
6726244|The 45K protein is a major phosphoprotein of amygdala , representing 3.2 % of the total particulate phosphoproteins in control animals and 7.4 % in the kindled animals .
6840252|A significant increase in seizure threshold and in the number of days required to develop kindled seizures was found in rats stimulated in the amygdala contralateral to the infarct .
6840252|These data suggest that contralateral frontoparietal cerebral infarct may have inhibitory influences on seizures originating from the amygdala .
6870206|Eight electrical stimulations were delivered to the amygdala at 2-minute intervals in adult and suckling rats that were previously kindled from the left amygdala .
6870206|At maturity , all the surviving animals were kindled from the contralateral -LRB- right -RRB- amygdala .
7107988|In accordance with previous reports , intranigral WGA-HRP injections retrogradely labeled neurons located in the ipsilateral prefontal cortex , motor cortex , striatum , globus pallidus , central nucleus of the amygdala , anterior hypothalamic area , subthalamic nucleus , and dorsal raphe .
7245911|In 15 patients with destruction of the amygdala complex and the hippocampus , changes in EEG and skin-galvanic reflex were recorded when they were imagining events inducing emotions and when they were anticipating nociceptive stimulation .
7245911|Bilateral lesion of the amygdala complex and the hippocampus brings about a decrease of the heart rate under the action of emotiogenic stimuli instead of its increase , and diminishes the difference between objective manifestations of positive and negative emotional states .
7418666|Sato M , Tomoda T , Hikasa N , Otsuki S. Amygdaloid kindling was induced by daily electrical stimulation in the left amygdala in five groups of cats : a chronic cocaine pretreatment group ; a chronic methamphetamine -LRB- MAP -RRB- pretreatment group ; two treatment groups , one using pimozide and the other haloperidol during the period when kindling was being induced ; and a drug-free control group .
7418666|In rekindling to the right amygdala , seizure development was significantly suppressed compared to the control group .
742430|Radiofrequency lesions performed in the right amygdala and anterior third of right Ammon 's horn abolished the seizures at ten months follow up .
7477910|Volumes of hippocampus , amygdala and frontal lobe in Alzheimer patients with different apolipoprotein E genotypes .
7477910|We measured by magnetic resonance imaging the volumes of the hippocampus , amygdala , and frontal lobes in the three Alzheimer subgroups : patients with 2 , 1 or 0 E4 alleles .
7477910|We found that Alzheimer patients with E4/4 genotype -LRB- N = 5 -RRB- had smaller volumes of the hippocampus and the amygdala than those with E3/4 -LRB- N = 9 -RRB- and those with E3/3 or E2/3 -LRB- N = 12 -RRB- .
7477910|The difference was significant for the right hippocampus -LRB- -54 % of control -RRB- and the right amygdala -LRB- -37 % of control -RRB- .
7555991|In 1 patient , the intracranial EEG showed continuous asymptomatic subclinical seizure activity emanating from the right amygdala .
7576208|Differential effects of pretraining inactivation of the right or left amygdala on retention of inhibitory avoidance training .
7576208|Rats with bilateral cannulas aimed at the amygdalae received bilateral infusions of either buffer or lidocaine hydrochloride , or unilateral infusions of each , 5 min before continuous multiple-trial inhibitory avoidance -LRB- CMIA -RRB- training .
7576208|Unilateral infusions of lidocaine into the right or left amygdala did not affect acquisition .
7576208|Rats given lidocaine into the right amygdala were impaired on retention 48 hr later .
7576208|The findings are consistent with others indicating involvement of the amygdala in acquisition and consolidation of aversively motivated learning and suggest possible differential involvement of the right and left amygdalae in memory consolidation .
7588586|To further assess the nature of kindling antagonism , we established antagonism between the amygdala and the septal area and subsequently evaluated the development of seizures provoked by stimulation of sites distal to the dominant site -LRB- always the amygdala -RRB- .
7588586|In Experiment 2 , development of generalized seizures from the previously naive right amygdala was virtually identical in rats previously kindled from the left amygdala and in rats expressing antagonism between the septal area and left amygdala .
7588586|Development of generalized seizures from the right amygdala was faster than from the left amygdala in both groups of rats , however , suggesting that the expression of seizures provoked from the suppressed site after the establishment of antagonism does not involve a general impairment or enhancement of transfer .
7588586|Experiment 3 revealed that radio-frequency lesions of the dominant site -LRB- amygdala -RRB- after the establishment of antagonism did not alter the subsequent development of generalized seizures from the suppressed site -LRB- septal area -RRB- .
7593349|The results suggest that nitric oxide radicals were produced and trapped in the areas that are known to have high nitric oxide synthase activity , such as cortex , hippocampus , hypothalamus , amygdala , and substantia nigra .
7599020|The most striking finding was that the increases in occipital and temporal omega activity from baseline to procaine positively correlated with rCBF increases in the amygdala and its efferents -LRB- p < .05 -RRB- , in a pattern very similar to the rCBF increases seen after procaine administration .
7605591|Volumes of hippocampus , amygdala and frontal lobes in the MRI-based diagnosis of early Alzheimer 's disease : correlation with memory functions .
7605591|We studied the usefulness of measuring volumes of the hippocampus , amygdala and frontal lobes with coronal magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- scans in the diagnosis of early Alzheimer 's disease -LRB- AD -RRB- .
7605591|The reductions in volumes of the right frontal lobe -LRB- -13 % -RRB- , the right amygdala -LRB- -14 % -RRB- or the left amygdala -LRB- -18 % -RRB- were not statistically significant .
7605591|In the discriminant function analysis which included the volumes of the hippocampus , amygdala , and the frontal lobes and age , the volumes of the left and right hippocampus , the left and right frontal lobe , and the right amygdala entered the model and we could correctly classify 92 % of the subjects into AD and control groups -LRB- Chi-square 42.6 , df 5 , p < 0.001 -RRB- .
7605591|By using the volumes of the hippocampus , the frontal lobes or the amygdala on their alone , the correct classification was achieved in 88 % , 65 % and 58 % of the subjects , respectively .
7609874|Left brain lesions resulted in significant bilateral increases in amygdala dopamine turnover .
7609874|Bilateral lesions increased dopamine content in the left amygdala and decreased dopamine in the right nucleus accumbens .
7609874|Also in this group , dopamine turnover was increased in the right nucleus accumbens and decreased in the right amygdala .
7620622|Development and pharmacological suppression of secondary afterdischarges in the hippocampus of amygdala-kindled rats .
7620622|The development and spread of afterdischarges in the ipsilateral limbic system during amygdala kindling , a model of complex partial seizures , was studied in male and female rats .
7620622|Kindling stimulation was performed in the basolateral amygdala , and afterdischarges were recorded from the stimulation electrode and electrodes in the nucleus accumbens , the posterior piriform cortex and the ventral hippocampus , all implanted on the right side of the brain .
7620622|The development of robust secondary afterdischarges , which occurred after the end of the primary afterdischarges in the amygdala and which always originated in the hippocampus but also spread to one or more of the other recording sites , is described .
7620622|All drugs suppressed the secondary afterdischarges , although they had a different anticonvulsant efficacy on motor seizures and afterdischarge duration after amygdala stimulation .
7625467|CCK4-induced anxiety was associated with 1 -RRB- robust and bilateral increases in extracerebral blood flow in the vicinity of the superficial temporal artery territory and 2 -RRB- CBF increases in the anterior cingulate gyrus , the claustrum-insular-amygdala region , and the cerebellar vermis .
7625467|CONCLUSIONS : Some of the temporopolar cortex CBF activation peaks previously reported in humans in association with drug - and non-drug-induced anxiety , as well as the increase in regional CBF in the claustrum-insular-amygdala region , may be of vascular and/or muscular origin .
7633882|Long-lasting increase in protein kinase C activity in the hippocampus of amygdala-kindled rat .
7633882|In this study , we investigated the effect of kindling from the left amygdala on PKC activities in the amygdala/pyriform cortex and hippocampus at long seizure-free intervals -LRB- 4 and 16 weeks -RRB- from the last amygdala-kindled seizure .
7633882|There was no significant alteration in the membrane-associated PKC activity of the kindled group in the right hippocampus or amygdala/pyriform cortex in any seizure-free interval after the last amygdala seizure .
7676126|An MRI with both axial and coronal slices showed a right-sided infarct affecting the whole posterior limb of the internal capsule including the genu , the posterior part of the globus pallidus , the anterior third of the cerebral peduncle and the amygdala but sparing the thalamus and the corona radiata .
7703420|We approached this question by measuring the volumes of the amygdala , hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus with magnetic resonance imaging in 15 controls , 13 unmedicated patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy and 16 patients with chronic drug-refractory epilepsy .
7719727|Differential involvement of the right and left amygdalae in expression of memory for aversively motivated training .
7719727|The present study investigated possible lateralization of amygdala involvement in memory for aversively motivated training .
7719727|Rats with bilateral cannulae aimed at the amygdalae were trained in a one-trial inhibitory avoidance task .
7719727|Retention latencies of rats given bilateral lidocaine or unilateral lidocaine into only the right amygdala were significantly lower than controls .
7719727|These results suggest that the right and left amygdalae may make differential contributions to the expression of memory , and that the contribution of the right amygdala may be more important to the expression of memory for aversively motivated training .
7754682|In cats during orienting reaction to clicks , correlation between averaged EPs of the auditory cortex , amygdala and hypothalamus was dominant in the left hemisphere .
7763329|The inferior thalamic peduncle carries fibers which connect the thalamus with orbitofrontal , insular , and temporal cortex , as well as the amygdala via the ansa peduncularis to the ventral amygdalofugal pathway .
7778105|Increased defensiveness was paralleled by a delayed onset potentiation of neural transmission between the amygdala and the medial hypothalamus of the left hemisphere .
7778105|These data strongly suggest that lasting affective change is mediated by lasting changes in particular efferents of the amygdala of the right hemisphere .
7783858|We have previously reported that centrally administered CRF rapidly induces c-fos mRNA expression in most areas that express c-fos following stress : the limbic structures including the hippocampus , amygdala , septal nucleus and hypothalamic nuclei such as the paraventricular nucleus -LRB- PVN -RRB- , and brainstem nuclei such as Barrington 's nucleus and locus ceruleus -LRB- LC -RRB- .
7796168|The effects of intra-amygdala infusion of the GABAA agonist , muscimol , prior to retention testing was examined .
7796168|1 , rats were trained in a one-trial inhibitory-avoidance task and given bilateral intra-amygdala infusions of vehicle or muscimol or simultaneous unilateral infusions of each , 5 min before the retention test 24 h after training .
7796168|Groups given bilateral infusions of muscimol or unilateral infusion of muscimol into the right amygdala had significantly shorter latencies to enter the dark compartment than groups given bilateral infusions of vehicle or unilateral infusion of muscimol into the left amygdala .
7796168|Bilateral muscimol infusions impaired acquisition of CMIA relative to bilateral vehicle infusions or unilateral muscimol infusion into the left amygdala .
7796168|These results suggest differential involvement of the right and left amygdala in memory .
7804662|Proton MRS spectra were obtained from a 12 cm3 voxel -LRB- 2 x 2 x 3 cm -RRB- in the right and left hippocampus/amygdala region .
7804662|RESULTS : NAA intensities were significantly reduced in the right hippocampus/amygdala region of schizophrenic patients -LRB- P = 0.038 -RRB- .
7804662|CONCLUSIONS : The findings of decreased NAA in this study suggest that there may be a decrement in neuronal number or tissue volume of the right hippocampal/amygdala region in schizophrenia .
7834183|8 In vitro autoradiographic studies revealed a heterogeneous distribution of -LSB- 125I -RSB- - iodophenpropitbinding sites in rat brain , with highest densities observed in specific cerebral cortical areas and layers , the caudate-putamen complex , the olfactory tubercles , the hippocampal formation , the amygdala complex , the hypothalamic area and the mammillary bodies .9 It is concluded that the histamine H3-receptor antagonist , -LSB- 125I -RSB- - iodophenpropit , meets the criteria fo ra suitable radioligand for histamine H3-receptor binding studies in rat brain .
7845556|Asymmetry in behavioral responses to cholecystokinin microinjected into rat nucleus accumbens and amygdala .
7845556|The behavioral responses of rats to uni - or bilateral microinjections of the octapeptide cholecystokinin -LRB- CCK-8 -RRB- into the left and/or right or both nucleus accumbens -LRB- NA -RRB- or amygdalae were studied .
7845556|CCK-8 exerted a favorable effect on learning and memory -LRB- shuttle-box -RRB- when injected into the left but not into the right amygdala .
7845556|Injection of CCK-8 -LRB- 0.01 micrograms -RRB- into left amygdala provoked a 4-fold increase of the number of avoidances as compared to the microinjection into the right amygdala .
7874522|Collateral axonal projections from ventrolateral medullary non-catecholaminergic neurons to central nucleus of the amygdala .
7874522|Retrograde tract-tracing techniques were used to investigate whether catecholaminergic neurons in the ventrolateral medulla -LRB- VLM -RRB- send collateral axonal projections to both central nuclei of the amygdala -LRB- ACe -RRB- in the rat .
7887189|Memory impairment in patients with stereotaxic lesions to the hippocampus and amygdala .
7887189|The study aimed at testing : -LRB- 1 -RRB- whether stereotaxic damage to the hippocampus and amygdala results in a memory deficit , -LRB- 2 -RRB- whether the memory functions subserved by the hippocampus are lateralized and -LRB- 3 -RRB- whether time limited storage of sensory information is impaired after focal hippocampal and amygdalar lesions .
7887189|Seven patients with unilateral stereotaxic damage to the anterior part of hippocampus and unilateral or bilateral damage to the medial part of amygdala and 11 control subjects with no brain damage participated in the research .
7887189|The results indicate that even small damage limited to the anterior part of the hippocampus and medial part of the amygdala results in a mild memory deficit .
7887189|The results showed , however , that sensory information storage limited to 3 s is not impaired after focal damage to the hippocampus and amygdala .
7902626|Finally , changes in the content of neurochemicals in the insular cortex and amygdala have been measured that may be involved in mediating the autonomic changes elicited by MCAO .
7910755|From these scans , the following structures were identified and the volume or area quantified : third ventricle , lateral ventricles -LRB- partial -RRB- , amygdala and hippocampus -LRB- one slice -RRB- , partial brain volume -LRB- in one slice through the parietal lobe -RRB- , and total prefrontal and temporal lobe gray and white matter in both cortical regions .
7936293|Volumetric MRI analysis of the amygdala and the hippocampus in subjects with age-associated memory impairment : correlation to visual and verbal memory .
7936293|We measured volumes of the hippocampus and amygdala by MRI in 16 AAMI subjects and in 16 age - and sex-matched controls and correlated the volumes with subjects ' performance on two visual memory tasks -LRB- the Benton and the Heaton visual retention tests -RRB- and on a verbal memory task -LRB- the Buschke-Fuld Selective Reminding Test -RRB- .
7950308|All bilateral structures were symmetric or nearly symmetric in volume , with the exception of a slightly larger right neocortex and amygdala , and larger left lateral ventricle .
7991745|Hippocampus -LRB- anterior and posterior , right and left -RRB- , amygdala , entorhinal cortex , parahippocampal gyrus and cerebral cortex were rated for atrophy on a 4-point scale .
7996584|In contrast , neutropenic rats exhibited 52 % , 41 % , and 57 % reductions in lCBF in the frontal cortex , parietal cortex , and amygdala , respectively , of the injured hemisphere 24 h after trauma -LRB- all p < 0.05 vs nonneutropenic controls -RRB- .
8019524|Depth recordings were obtained from 1198 sites in the occipital , temporal and parietal cortices , and in the limbic system -LRB- amygdala , hippocampal formation and posterior cingulate gyrus -RRB- .
8019524|The N130 , but not later components of this complex , was observed in the anterior hippocampus and amygdala .
8117582|Pathophysiologically , the reexperiencing of the trauma and the arousal may be associated with dysfunction of the locus coeruleus , amygdala and hippocampal systems .
8140150|The effect of kindling of different nuclei in the left and right amygdala on anxiety in the rat .
8140150|The animals were kindled in medial or basolateral amygdalas , of either the left or right hemisphere .
8140150|Analysis of electrode location showed that some animals were kindled in amygdaloid nuclei other than medial or basolateral amygdala .
8140150|Kindling of the medial/basolateral amygdala in the left hemisphere decreased anxiety for at least 1 week after the last kindled seizure .
8140150|More anterior foci in the amygdala were associated with more anxiety .
8140150|More posterior amygdala foci were associated with less anxiety .
8140150|These findings point to the importance of kindled focus in the amygdala for behavioral effect .
8140150|Future research should carefully control the location of kindled foci when investigating effects of amygdala kindling on anxiety and other behaviors .
8149221|In the forebrain , FLI appeared bilaterally in the central nucleus of the amygdala , para - and periventricular hypothalamus , supraoptic nucleus , paraventricular thalamus , reuniens nucleus , subfornical organ and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis .
8159262|Neuron loss and shrinkage in the amygdala in Alzheimer 's disease .
8159262|Total neuron numbers in the amygdala and in eight of its subnuclei were determined in 9 cases of Alzheimer 's disease -LRB- AD -RRB- and in 6 age-matched controls -LRB- AMC -RRB- .
8159262|A neuron loss of 56.3 % for the left amygdala and 50.5 % for the right amygdala in AD was found , being more severe than previously reported .
8159262|The subdivisions showed a differential neuron loss ranging from 35.5 % in nucleus lateralis of the right amygdala to 70.4 % in the nucleus basalis accessorius of the right amygdala .
8172008|The temporal lobe gray matter is reduced , including amygdala-hippocampal complex , and parahippocampal gyrus .
8268040|He was diagnosed as left temporal lobe epilepsy and performed removal of amygdala , hippocampus , parahippocampal gyrus and fusiform gyrus .
8272203|On the other hand , the SPECT scans in the stages with the psychotic states revealed focal hyperperfusion images in the left temporal lobe or amygdala in case 1 , and a normal perfusion pattern without asymmetric images of the right and left temporal lobes in case 2 .
8299274|The bilateral thalamic lesion seemed to affect the following structures , as judged from MRI : 1 -RRB- The anterior thalamic peduncle including most of the reciprocal connections between dorsomedial nucleus of thalamus -LRB- MD nucleus -RRB- and the frontal lobe , 2 -RRB- The inferior thalamic peduncle which serves as the reciprocal pathway between MD nucleus and medial temporal lobe , especially the amygdala -LRB- component of Yakovlev circuit -RRB- , and 3 -RRB- The inferior part of mammillothalamic tract -LRB- component of Papez circuit -RRB- .
8318436|The suppressing effect of chlorpromazine treatment on alimentary-social differentiation in amygdala dogs .
8318436|Experiments were performed on dogs with bilateral electrolytic damage of dorso-medial amygdala .
8318436|It was concluded that chlorpromazine exerts a suppressing effect on motivated behavior reinforced by positive rewards in amygdala dogs .
8318436|As the effect of chlorpromazine and medial amygdalar damage are summated it may be suggested that the deficit of medial amygdala neurons impairs similar neurochemical mechanisms , -LRB- probably dopaminergic and alpha-adrenergic transmission -RRB- as does chlorpromazine .
8363448|OBJECTIVES : To study the ability of magnetic resonance imaging to measure the volume of the amygdala and detect amygdala atrophy in patients with early Alzheimer 's disease .
8363448|Two neuroradiologists independently and blindly measured the volume of the right and left amygdalas on high-resolution contiguous slices .
8363448|The Alzheimer 's disease group showed significant -LRB- 33 % , P < .0001 -RRB- atrophy of the amygdala when compared with the control group .
8363448|CONCLUSION : Significant amygdala atrophy can be detected in vivo in patients with early Alzheimer 's disease by means of standard magnetic resonance imaging .
8389291|Characterization of mu opioid receptor binding during amygdala kindling in rats and effects of chronic naloxone pretreatment : an autoradiographic study .
8389291|Using in vitro autoradiography , mu receptor binding in rat brain was characterized at different amygdala kindling stages and in amygdaloid kindled animals pretreated chronically with naloxone .
8389291|Male Sprague-Dawley rats implanted with bipolar electrodes in the right amygdala received one of the following pretreatments s.c. for 14 days via osmotic minipumps : normal saline solution , 0.5 microliters/h , or naloxone HCl , 75 micrograms/h .
8389291|Our data showed different patterns of mu receptor binding during the normal kindling process : during stage II-III , pronounced binding increase was detected in cingulate , temporal and entorhinal cortices , anterior amygdala , caudate putamen , thalamic nuclei , ventrolateral and dorsolateral portions of central gray , substantia nigra pars compacta and pars reticulata .
8389291|Twenty-four hours after the last stage V kindled seizure , enhanced binding was observed in cingulate and frontoparietal cortices , anterior amygdala , caudate putamen and ventromedial thalamic nucleus .
8389291|Twenty-eight days after the last stage V kindled seizure , binding augmentation was noticed in cingulate and frontoparietal cortices , whereas decreased binding was detected in amygdala complex , substantia nigra pars reticulata , piriform , perirhinal , parietal , temporal and entorhinal cortices .
8389291|Our data indicate different regional selective patterns of mu receptor binding during amygdala kindling which may depend on epileptogenesis and long-term changes induced by this process .
8394966|Increase of kainate receptor mRNA in the hippocampal CA3 of amygdala-kindled rats detected by in situ hybridization .
8394966|Rats in which left-amygdala-kindling had been established were decapitated 28 days after the last kindled seizure along with the matched controls , which had been subjected to electrode implantation but not to kindling , and the brain sections were hybridized with the probes .
8394966|The amount of KA receptor mRNA detected with the KA-1 probe increased -LRB- 25 % -RRB- on both the left and right sides of the hippocampal CA3 region in the kindled rats , but in no other brain areas -LRB- hippocampal CA1 , dentate gyrus , amygdala nuclei and pyriform cortex -RRB- .
8394966|The increase of KA receptor mRNA in the CA3 of amygdala-kindled rats may indicate that the excitability of the neural circuits mediated by KA receptors increased in the hippocampus as a consequence of kindling .
8395955|The binding sites for -LSB- 3H -RSB- cAMP were discretely localized , and were in the order of : cerebral cortex = hypothalamus = amygdala > hippocampus = neostriatum = thalamus = nucleus accumbens > globus pallidus = cerebellum .
8396516|Microscopical examinations of the nervous system revealed neuronal loss , astrogliosis and perivascular and parenchymatous lymphocytic infiltration in the hippocampus , subiculum , amygdala , putamen , medulla oblongata , spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia .
8415932|Wistar rats were kindled electrically in the anterior or posterior medial amygdala of the right hemisphere .
8415932|Anxiety levels of rats kindled in posterior medial amygdala were reduced relative to implanted controls , but not relative to unoperated controls .
8415932|Kindling of the anterior medial amygdala increased anxiety relative to implanted and unoperated controls .
8415932|The stress of an ICV injection of saline increased anxiety in unkindled controls but reduced anxiety in anterior medial amygdala-kindled rats .
8415932|In contrast , injection of CRF -LRB- 2 micrograms , ICV -RRB- has no greater effect than ICV saline in anterior medial amygdala kindled rats , whereas it was anxiogenic in unkindled rats .
8417581|METHOD : Magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure the volume of selected circuit brain regions -LRB- i.e. , the prefrontal region and caudate -RRB- and noncircuit brain regions -LRB- i.e. , the amygdala/hippocampus complex -RRB- in 17 deficit and 24 nondeficit schizophrenic outpatients and 30 normal comparison subjects .
8417581|There were no differences between the two schizophrenic subgroups in left caudate or right and left amygdala/hippocampus complex volumes .
8417581|Both schizophrenic subgroups had larger left caudate volumes and smaller right and left amygdala/hippocampus complex volumes than the normal subjects .
8436698|Nonresponders also had significantly lower relative metabolic rates in medial frontal and hippocampal areas as well as the right amygdala .
8461278|These results are interpreted in the context of recent evidence linking reversal learning to a neural network comprising the cholinergic basal forebrain , the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex , as well as the mediodorsal nucleus , and recent evidence of cholinergic deficits in this structure in patients with Alzheimer 's disease .
8471676|Hippocampus-amygdala volumes and psychopathology in chronic schizophrenia .
8471676|Volumes of the mesiotemporal structures -LRB- hippocampus-amygdala complex -RRB- were measured in 19 men who were chronic multiepisode schizophrenics and 18 age-matched healthy controls using T1-weighted contiguous coronal magnetic resonance images of 3.1-mm width .
8471676|Using the level of the mammillary bodies as an anatomical landmark , the whole hippocampus-amygdala complex was divided into an anterior section -LRB- mainly containing amygdaloid tissue -RRB- and a posterior section -LRB- mainly containing the hippocampal formation -RRB- .
8535852|Differential effects of unilateral lesions in the medial amygdala on spontaneous and induced ovulation .
8535852|The possible existence of asymmetry in the control of ovulation by the medial amygdala was explored .
8535852|Unilateral lesions of the medial amygdala were performed on each day of the estrous cycle .
8535852|The estral index diminished in almost all animals with a lesion in the right side of medial amygdala .
8535852|Lesions of the right medial amygdala , when performed on diestrus-1 , resulted in a significant decrease in the number of rats ovulating compared to controls -LRB- 4/8 vs. 8/8 , p < 0.05 -RRB- .
8535852|In a second experiment , administration of GnRH did not restore ovulation in rats with lesions of the right medial amygdala .
8535852|These data suggest that control of ovulation by the medial amygdala is asymmetric and varies during the estrous cycle .
8559350|A histological examination of the resected anterotemporal lobe , amygdala , and hippocampus and biopsy specimens of the lesion showed extensive multifocal cortical microdysgenesis and gliovascular and cortical hamartoma .
8560947|Content of cAMP in the frontal cortex -LRB- FC -RRB- , hippocampus -LRB- HP -RRB- , hypothalamus -LRB- HT -RRB- and amygdala -LRB- A -RRB- was determined in 20-month old male Wistar rats with different types of behaviour in `` emotional resonance '' test .
8590050|The hippocampal granule cells receive major inputs via the perforant path from other limbic structures such as the amygdala -LRB- AM -RRB- .
8595027|In contrast , the ventral limbic pathway from the amygdala to orbital frontal cortex may implement a tight , restricted mode of motor control that reflects adaptive constraints of self-preservation .
8610822|Volumes of the temporal lobe , superior temporal gyrus , amygdala , and hippocampus were measured by manually outlining these structures on contiguous 2-mm thick coronal slices .
8636466|Following middle cerebral artery occlusion in Wistar rats , the immunoreactivity of neuropeptide Y increased ipsilaterally in the insular cortex and basolateral nucleus of the amygdala .
8636466|In addition , the immunoreactivity of leucine-enkephalin , dynorphin , and neurotensin increased in the ipsilateral central nucleus of the amygdala .
8636466|The amygdalar neurochemical changes are likely the result of damage to the insular cortex , although other cortical areas were also affected by the ischemia .
8636466|The amygdalar neurochemical changes , including neuropeptide Y increase in the basolateral nucleus and leucine-enkephalin , dynorphin , and neurotensin increase in the central nucleus , were seen only when the ipsilateral insular cortex was lesioned .
8636466|Our findings indicate that damage to the insular cortex is essential in eliciting the neurochemical changes in the ipsilateral amygdala .
8642416|Specific involvement of human parietal systems and the amygdala in the perception of biological motion .
8642416|By contrast , the rostrocaudal part of the right superior temporal sulcus and adjacent temporal cortex , and limbic structures such as the amygdala , are involved in the perception of signs conveyed by expressive body movements .
8660127|Volumetric measures of the cerebrum , caudate nucleus , putamen , globus pallidus , amygdala , hippocampus , temporal lobe , cerebellum ; a measure of prefrontal cortex ; and related right-left asymmetries were examined along with midsagittal area measures of the cerebellum and corpus callosum .
8669226|Of special interest are the hypothalamus , amygdala , hippocampus and septal nuclei , the social-emotional functions they mediate and the neural circuit that supports their activity .
8693778|Lipid content and free radical processes in brain cortex as well as cAMP content in frontal cortex , hippocampus , hypothalamus , and amygdala were investigated in 20-month old male Wistar rats with different strategies of behaviour in a situation of competition for food and way of its procurance .
8693778|However , no intergroup differences were revealed in the content of cAMP in the hippocampus , frontal cortex , and amygdala .
8693778|Cross-correlation between cAMP levels in the frontal cortex , hippocampus , hypothalamus , and amygdala revealed specific features of correlation of cAMP content in animals with different behavioural strategies .
8698883|Quantitative MRI of the temporal lobe , amygdala , and hippocampus in normal human development : ages 4-18 years .
8698883|jgiedd@helix.nih.gov The volume of the temporal lobe , superior temporal gyrus , amygdala , and hippocampus was quantified from magnetic images of the brains of 99 healthy children and adolescents aged 4-18 years .
8698883|However , sex-specific maturational changes were noted in the volumes of medial temporal structures , with the left amygdala increasing significantly only in males and with the right hippocampus increasing significantly only in females .
8698883|Right-greater-than-left laterality effects were found for temporal lobe , superior temporal gyrus , amygdala , and hippocampal volumes .
8708688|Based on an analysis of her lesion , which disconnected the thalamus from the orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala , and considering the similarities between her disorder , Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome , and the amnesia after orbitofrontal lesions , it is proposed that contextual amnesia results from interruption of the loop connecting the amygdala , the dorsomedial nucleus , and the orbitofrontal cortex .
8748470|CBF increased in left amygdala and decreased in right amygdala during sad mood relative to the averaged control conditions .
8753888|The right temporomesial activation included hippocampus , parahippocampus , and amygdala .
8762168|Unilateral amygdala inactivation after training attenuates memory for reduced reward .
8762168|meschesk@essex.uchsc.edu This experiment examined the effects of unilateral inactivation of the amygdalae on memory for reduction in reward magnitude .
8762168|Male Sprague-Dawley rats with bilateral cannulae in the amygdala were trained to run a straight alley for ten 45-mg food pellets .
8762168|Immediately following training on Day 10 , the animals received bilateral intra-amygdala infusions -LRB- 0.5 microliter/side -RRB- of phosphate buffer or 2 % lidocaine in one amygdala simultaneously with infusion of buffer in the other amygdala .
8762168|These findings indicate that post-shift inactivation of only one amygdala can attenuate the response to reward reduction .
8762168|These results are consistent with previous evidence that the right amygdala may be more involved than the left in consolidation of memory storage for aversive experience .
8774879|Given the role of the amygdaloid complexes in the acquisition of emotionally influenced memories , the pattern of activation in the amygdala and the cortical areas provides a biological basis for the processing of some types of memory during REM sleep .
8788076|Specificity of temporal amygdala atrophy in Alzheimer 's disease : quantitative assessment with magnetic resonance imaging .
8788076|The aim of the study was to assess the specificity of temporal amygdala -LRB- TA -RRB- atrophy with magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- by comparing a group of early impaired patients with Alzheimer 's disease -LRB- AD -RRB- with ` other types of dementia ' and controls .
8799764|The goals of this research were to use an original Memory Workload Paradigm with visually presented words and to explore the following points : -LRB- 1 -RRB- With depth electrodes , stereotaxically implanted in intracerebral structures bilaterally -LRB- amygdala , anterior hippocampus , posterior hippocampus , orbital-frontal , anterior cingulate gyrus and cortical areas -RRB- to delineate brain structures involved in this memory workload task .
8799764|Significant load effects for the N4 latency were found in both amygdalae and the left posterior hippocampus , as well as both anterior regions of the second temporal gyri -LRB- p < 0.01 -RRB- .
8799764|The intracerebral N4 latency varied linearly as a function of set size while the amplitude varied quadratically for the right amygdala and the left posterior hippocampus -LRB- p < 0.05 -RRB- .
8832627|The T2 of the amygdala did not differ across the groups .
8871967|Electrolytic lesion of caudate nucleus or amygdala impairs lateralized response .
8891302|Male Wistar rats received electrodes into the right basolateral amygdala and were subsequently kindled until fully generalized seizures could be elicited .
8891302|Since the ASR amplitude is a sensitive measure for anxiety or fear , these findings suggest that amygdala kindling does not induce a state of anxiety or fear .
8891302|It is concluded that amygdala kindling does not change emotional responding as measured by the ASR in rats .
8898725|Thirty min after PGE2 injection , a moderate to strong positive signal for c-fos mRNA was detected in multiple structures of the brain such as the medial preoptic area/organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis , supraoptic nucleus -LRB- SON -RRB- , parvocellular and magnocellular divisions of the paraventricular nucleus -LRB- PVN -RRB- of the hypothalamus , central nucleus of the amygdala , nucleus of the solitary tract , dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus , area postrema , dorsal division of the ambiguus nucleus , and throughout the choroid plexus and leptomeninges .
8921293|Supraspinal transneuronal infections were bilateral , showed no apparent side dominance and were found in the nucleus of the solitary tract , the area postrema , the raphe nuclei , the A5 group , the parabrachial region , the periaqueductal grey , the hypothalamus , the amygdala and the cortex , in particular the anterior cingulate , the frontal , prelimbic , infralimbic and insular cortices .
8931911|There were no statistically significant group differences in intracranial cavity , whole brain , ventricles , ventricle : brain ratio , or amygdala .
8942964|Involvement of the amygdala in memory storage : interaction with other brain systems .
8942964|jlmcgaug@uci.edu There is extensive evidence that the amygdala is involved in affectively influenced memory .
8942964|The central hypothesis guiding the research reviewed in this paper is that emotional arousal activates the amygdala and that such activation results in the modulation of memory storage occurring in other brain regions .
8942964|First , the effects of stress-related hormones -LRB- epinephrine and glucocorticoids -RRB- are mediated by influences involving the amygdala .
8942964|In rats , lesions of the amygdala and the stria terminalis block the effects of posttraining administration of epinephrine and glucocorticoids on memory .
8942964|Furthermore , memory is enhanced by posttraining intraamygdala infusions of drugs that activate beta-adrenergic and glucocorticoid receptors .
8942964|Additionally , infusion of beta-adrenergic blockers into the amygdala blocks the memory-modulating effects of epinephrine and glucocorticoids , as well as those of drugs affecting opiate and GABAergic systems .
8942964|Second , an intact amygdala is not required for expression of retention .
8942964|Inactivation of the amygdala prior to retention testing -LRB- by posttraining lesions or drug infusions -RRB- does not block retention performance .
8942964|beta-Blockers and amygdala lesions attenuate the effects of emotional arousal on memory .
8942964|Additionally , 3-week recall of emotional material is highly correlated with positronemission tomography activation -LRB- cerebral glucose metabolism -RRB- of the right amygdala during encoding .
8942964|These findings provide strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that the amygdala is involved in modulating long-term memory storage .
8988790|Forty-six schizophrenic patients were compared to 60 normal controls and 27 bipolar subjects on MRI measures of bilateral volumes of anterior and posterior superior temporal gyrus -LRB- STG -RRB- , amygdala , entorhinal cortex , and multiple medial temporal structures , as well as global brain measures .
8988790|Additionally , left anterior STG and right amygdala were smaller than predicted in schizophrenia but not bipolar disorder .
8988790|Left amygdala was smaller and right anterior STG larger in bipolar disorder but not schizophrenia .
9000451|Antecedent tone presentation differentially alters the rate of amygdala kindling : continued exposure is not required for this region-specific effect .
9000451|Recently we reported that antecedent tone presentation significantly delays the rate of amygdala kindling when it precedes and overlaps with every kindling trial .
9000451|To investigate this , male Long-Evans hooded rats were implanted with a bipolar electrode in the right amygdala and assigned to a Tone , No Tone , or Tone Discontinued group and kindled once daily .
9010003|Startle reflex and emotion modulation impairment after a right amygdala lesion .
9010003|In the present study , startle responses during resting states as well as during the presentation of a set of emotive slides were recorded from a 32-year-old male patient with a rare localized lesion of the right amygdala .
9010003|The animal literature has shown that the circuit of this reflex is directly influenced by amygdala projections .
9010003|The data confirm , in the human , previous results from the literature in other species on amygdala involvement in startle and emotional responses .
9010003|Furthermore , the observation of the importance of the right amygdala in the modulation of emotion is consistent with the hypothesis of right hemisphere specialization for aversive emotions .
9010003|The results are discussed in the context of the literature on human amygdala lesions .
9042528|Pretreatment with DMI protected -LSB- 3H -RSB- DA synthesis in the basal ganglia , but not in the olfactory tubercle and amygdala ipsilateral to the lesion .
9042528|Whereas the 5-HT innervation does not contribute greatly to -LSB- 3H -RSB- DA synthesis in the basal ganglia , a substantial proportion of -LSB- 3H -RSB- DA synthesis in olfactory tubercle and amygdala requires an intact 5-HT innervation .
9045992|Using this model , neurochemical changes , that were maximal at 3-5 days and subsiding by day 10 , were observed unilaterally in the insular cortex and amygdala .
9045992|The amygdalar neurochemical changes may be related to the stroke-induced cardiovascular disturbances , since the amygdala is critical in mediating the cardiovascular responses to stress .
9054154|-LSB- The similarity and difference between dogs assessed by the indices of the summary electrical activity of the frontal cortex , hippocampus , amygdala and hypothalamus -RSB- .
9054154|Eight dogs were bilaterally implanted with stainless steel electrodes in dorsal and ventral hippocampi -LRB- DHp , VHp -RRB- , basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , lateral hypothalamus -LRB- LH -RRB- and with silver spherical electrodes in the frontal cortex -LRB- FC -RRB- .
9065532|MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Global and hemispheric regional volumes -LRB- in cm3 -RRB- of cerebral hemispheres , cortex , white matter , ventricles , caudate , lenticulate , central gray nuclei , insula , amygdala , and hippocampus .
9075464|RESULTS : Unlike control subjects , subjects with PTSD had increased rCBF in ventral anterior cingulate gyrus and right amygdala when generating mental images of combat-related pictures ; when viewing combat pictures , subjects with PTSD showed decreased rCBF in Broca 's area .
9075464|CONCLUSIONS : Results suggest that ventral anterior cingulate gyrus and right amygdala play a role in the response of combat veterans with PTSD to mental images of combat-related scenes .
9105578|Opposite effects on two different measures of retention following unilateral inactivation of the amygdala .
9105578|We previously reported finding differential effects of unilateral infusion of lidocaine into the right and left amygdalae prior to a retention test 24 h after one-trial inhibitory avoidance training .
9105578|The present study was undertaken to determine whether the degree of training in an escape task influences the effects of unilateral inactivation of the amygdala with lidocaine prior to the retention test .
9105578|Forty-eight h later , the rats received bilateral microinfusions into the amygdalae of either buffer , or lidocaine into one amygdala and buffer in the other , 5 min before they were tested for retention of the escape training using a continuous multiple trial inhibitory avoidance -LRB- CMIA -RRB- procedure -LRB- 0.4 mA -RRB- .
9105578|As indicated by initial response latencies on the first retention test , unilateral inactivation of either the right or the left amygdala severely impaired retention performance for the escape training regardless of the number of prior escape training trials received .
9105578|However , unilateral inactivation of either amygdala had no effect on acquisition of CMIA .
9105578|Furthermore , unilateral inactivation of either amygdala during CMIA training did not affect retention tested 48 h later .
9105578|These results suggest that the differential involvement of the right and left amygdalae may be limited to certain training conditions .
9105578|Furthermore , these findings demonstrate opposite effects on 2 different measures of retention indicating that the method of testing retention affects the interpretation of the memory impairment induced by infusion of lidocaine into the amygdala .
9126402|Left-lateralized CBF in the amygdala and hippocampus correlated with better word sensitivity as well as specificity -LRB- ability to correctly reject foils -RRB- .
9126402|In addition , left-lateralized CBF in the amygdala and right-lateralized CBF in the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus correlated with `` mental effort '' indices -LRB- task performance relative to basal ability -RRB- for word and face memory tasks , respectively .
9135046|Previous studies suggest that the left and right amygdalae are interconnected in rodents .
9135046|In the present study , we investigated the interamygdaloid projections originating in the different divisions of the basal and accessory basal nuclei of the rat amygdala by using the Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin anterograde tract-tracing technique .
9135046|Via these connections , one amygdala may rapidly activate the contralateral side .
9135046|This may explain , for example , why the epileptic seizures in one amygdala spread contralaterally and cause the development of independent seizure activity in kindling model of temporal lobe epilepsy .
9173736|By comparison of motivational excitation with available stimuli or their engrams the amygdala selects a dominant motivation , destined to be satisfied in the first instance .
9178546|Furthermore , this pulvinar activity correlated positively with responses in structures hypothesized to mediate value in the brain right amygdala and basal forebrain -LRB- including the cholinergic nucleus basalis of Meynert -RRB- .
9184662|Laterality in the histological effects of injections of amyloid-beta 25-35 into the amygdala of young Fischer rats .
9184662|We have observed that single amyloid-beta 25-35 -LRB- A beta -RRB- injections -LRB- 5.0 nmol -RRB- into the right amygdala of rats produce progressive cytoskeletal and astrogliotic reactions not only within the amygdala , but also in distal brain regions that project to the amygdala .
9184662|To determine if these effects are potentiated by bilateral injections , we injected A beta -LRB- 5.0 nmol -RRB- into the left and right amygdala of young male Fischer rats .
9184662|Bilateral infusions of A beta induced significant neuronal shrinkage , tau-2 neuronal staining , and reactive astrocytosis within the right amygdala and/or hippocampus , compared with vehicle-treated rats .
9184662|Surprisingly , the same brain regions within the left hemisphere were significantly less affected even though no differences were observed between the left and right amygdala in the size of Congored-positive A beta deposits .
9184662|Unilateral injections of A beta into the left amygdala led to significant histological changes in the right amygdala and hippocampus , but not in the same brain regions within the left hemisphere .
9226658|We sought to elucidate the contributions of the amygdala , hippocampus and temporal neocortex to learning and memory for verbal and visuospatial material .
9226658|Two matched learning tasks , using abstract words versus abstract designs , were administered to patients with unilateral neocorticectomy -LRB- NCE ; Dublin -RRB- , selective amygdalohippocampectomy -LRB- AHE ; Zurich -RRB- or anterior temporal-lobe resection invading the amygdala and hippocampus -LRB- ATL ; Montreal -RRB- .
9226659|Autopsy showed : previous left temporal lobectomy with absence of left amygdala and hippocampus , atrophy of fornix and mamillary body ; neuronal loss in the right hippocampus , severe in CA1 and CA4 ; intact right amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus ; recent diffuse damage associated with cause of death .
9226659|Hippocampal zones CA1 and/or CA4 are critical for maintaining memory and the amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus cortex alone can not support acquisition of new memories .
9240403|The results show that systemic injection of IL-6 induced specific transcription of c-fos gene in most of the sensorial circumventricular organs , including the organum vasculosum lamina terminalis , subfornical organ , median eminence , and area postrema , as well as in the central nucleus of the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis .
9252998|By comparison of motivational excitation with available stimuli or their engrams , the amygdala selects a dominant motivation , destined to be satisfied in the first instance .
9255598|MRI volumetry and T2 relaxometry of the amygdala in newly diagnosed and chronic temporal lobe epilepsy .
9255598|However , the T2 relaxation time of the left amygdala was > or = 111 msec -LRB- i.e. , > or = 2 S.D. over the mean T2 time of the left amygdala in control subjects -RRB- in seven -LRB- 10 % -RRB- patients , one of which was newly diagnosed and six were chronic .
9255598|The T2 time of the right amygdala was prolonged in eight -LRB- 12 % -RRB- patients , three of which were newly diagnosed and five were chronic .
9267774|Bradycardia induced from stimulation of the left versus right central nucleus of the amygdala .
9267774|Studies have demonstrated that the predominant effect of stimulation of the central nucleus of the amygdala is one of heart rate deceleration .
9267774|The results of this study suggest that stimulation of the central nucleus of the amygdala from either the left or right hemisphere produced similar increases in heart period .
9285085|Murderers were characterized by reduced glucose metabolism in the prefrontal cortex , superior parietal gyrus , left angular gyrus , and the corpus callosum , while abnormal asymmetries of activity -LRB- left hemisphere lower than right -RRB- were also found in the amygdala , thalamus , and medial temporal lobe .
9285461|CONCLUSIONS : The presence of perihippocampal damage involving the amygdala proper , its surrounding cortex , and the subiculum further increased the severity of memory impairment attributable to hippocampal damage in Alzheimer 's disease .
9285464|Volumetric tracings of the hippocampus and amygdala from the MRI were superimposed on the postictal and interictal SPECT .
9285464|Asymmetries in hippocampal and amygdala SPECT signal were then calculated using the equation : % Asymmetry = 100 x -LRB- right - left -RRB- / -LRB- right + left -RRB- / 2 .
9285464|RESULTS : In the postictal studies , quantitative measurements of amygdala SPECT intensities were greatest on the side of seizure onset in all cases , with an average % asymmetry of 11.1 , range 5.2-21 .9 .
9285464|Hyperperfusion in the region of the amygdala is more consistently lateralising than hyperperfusion in the region of the hippocampus in postictal studies .
9310998|Stereotactic surgery was performed in Wistar rats and stainless steel injection chemitrode were inserted in bilateral amygdala -LRB- AM -RRB- .
9330368|After Haemaccel or dextran areas such as the supraoptic nucleus , the magnocellular paraventricular nucleus , the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis , diagonal band of Broca and amygdala either did not produce Fos or were not consistently different from the control group .
9331351|Cocaine induced focal signal increases in nucleus accumbens/subcallosal cortex -LRB- NAc/SCC -RRB- , caudate , putamen , basal forebrain , thalamus , insula , hippocampus , parahippocampal gyrus , cingulate , lateral prefrontal and temporal cortices , parietal cortex , striate/extrastriate cortices , ventral tegmentum , and pons and produced signal decreases in amygdala , temporal pole , and medial frontal cortex .
9331351|Sustained negative signal change was noted in the amygdala , which correlated with craving ratings .
9342202|Adjusted gray matter subcortical volumes were significantly smaller in relatives than in controls in total hippocampus , right amygdala , right putamen , left thalamus , and brainstem .
9363801|Local and distant histopathological effects of unilateral amyloid-beta 25-35 injections into the amygdala of young F344 rats .
9363801|To determine if amyloid-beta -LRB- A beta -RRB- induces tau-immunoreactivity -LRB- IR -RRB- and reactive astrocytosis in vivo , we injected A beta 25-35 -LRB- 5.0 nmol -RRB- into the right amygdala of rats .
9363801|At 8 days postinjection , the peptide induced tau-2 IR in neuronal cell bodies and processes ipsilaterally in the amygdala , cingulate cortex , and hippocampus .
9363801|At 32 days postinjection , the intensity of tau-2 IR was greater than at 8 days in the amygdala and hippocampus , but not in the cingulate cortex .
9363801|Beaded fibers with occasional neuronal perikarya were visualized with Alz-50 , and the IR was primarily observed in the ipsilateral amygdala .
9384826|Recent MRI investigations agree on the presence of volume reductions in schizophrenia in the medial temporal lobe structures of the hippocampus-amygdala complex and of the para-hippocampal gyrus .
9401599|Pathophysiologically , the reexperienceing of the trauma and the arousal may be associated with dysfunction of the locus coeruleus , amygdala and hippocampal systems .
9415900|Both seizures and FG-7142 induce long-term potentiation -LRB- LTP -RRB- in efferent pathways of the amygdala known to participate in feline defensive behavior .
9415900|Their representation may be in the form of NMDA-dependent LTP of transmission within the amygdala and between the amygdala and its efferents .
9421825|Relative HMPAO activity in selected brain regions revealed a significant increase in hippocampus-amygdala activity in TRD patients compared to non-TRD patients and healthy controls .
9421825|The observation of increased hippocampus-amygdala HMPAO activity in TRD patients suggests that functional abnormalities in limbic circuitry may play a role in the pathophysiology of treatment-resistance .
9425865|SE was induced in adult S-D rats with electric stimulation delivered through a stimulating/recording electrode targeted at the right amygdala .
9434086|In regard of recent data suggesting that the amygdala is playing a role in the recognition of fear in the auditory as well as in the visual modality this could suggest that the hippocampus may be part of the auditory pathway of fear recognition .
9442339|METHODS : We immunoquantified isotypes of G protein using specific antisera against alpha and beta subunits of G protein in the superior temporal , prefrontal , and entorhinal cortices as well as the nucleus accumbens and amygdala of postmortem brains from 19 schizophrenic and 28 control subjects .
9442339|In the nucleus accumbens and amygdala , the paranoid type schizophrenics showed a smaller amount of Gi alpha and Go alpha than the disorganized type schizophrenics .
9442339|CONCLUSIONS : The decreased Gq alpha immunoreactivity in the schizophrenic left superior temporal cortex may reflect the down-regulation of Gq alpha , resulting from chronic stimulation of Gq alpha-coupled receptors , while the decreased Gi alpha and Go alpha in the nucleus accumbens and amygdala of paranoid type schizophrenics may be related to the dopaminergic hyperactivity via dopamine D2 receptors .
9442345|METHODS : Using MRI , we measured volumes of left and right hippocampus , amygdala , and anterior and posterior parahippocampal gyrus -LRB- PHG -RRB- in 13 AD patients with mild cognitive impairment , defined as > or = 20 on the Mini-Mental State Exam , and in 21 healthy age - and sex-matched controls .
9442345|CONCLUSIONS : These results show that in mildly impaired AD patients atrophy is present in medial temporal lobe structures ; that MRI volumes of the anterior PHG , which contains entorhinal cortex , are reduced , but the amygdala and hippocampal volumes show greater reduction ; and that discriminant function analysis using all volumes as predictors can correctly classify a high proportion of individuals .
9461057|Bilateral injections of amyloid-beta 25-35 into the amygdala of young Fischer rats : behavioral , neurochemical , and time dependent histopathological effects .
9461057|To examine the time course of the histopathological effects of bilateral injections of amyloid-beta 25-35 -LRB- A beta -RRB- and to determine if these effects are associated with a reduction in choline acetyltransferase activity and behavioral impairments , we injected A beta -LRB- 5.0 nmol -RRB- into the amygdala of young male Fischer rats .
9461057|A beta induced neuronal tau-2 staining in the right , but not the left amygdala and hippocampus .
9461057|A beta also induced reactive astrocytosis and neuronal shrinkage within the right hippocampus and amygdala , respectively .
9462473|The amygdala and individual differences in human fear conditioning .
9462473|While animal research on fear conditioning suggests crucial involvement of the amygdala , this has not been corroborated in humans when using subtractive neuroimaging methodology .
9462473|Hence , we performed a directed search for amygdalar participation in human fear conditioning by correlating central and autonomic nervous activity .
9462473|A significant positive correlation was obtained between conditioned EDA and conditioned rCBF in the right amygdala -LRB- r = 0.75 , p < 0.05 -RRB- , supporting involvement of the amygdala in human fear conditioning .
9483295|In particular , an increase in dynorphin in the central nucleus of the amygdala occurs with a peak at 3 to 5 days after the stroke and is directly due to damage in the insular cortex .
9483295|Direct injection of dynorphin into the central nucleus of the amygdala can enhance the cardiovascular response obtained by stimulation of the acoustic stress pathway .
9483561|Drug-induced changes in nucleus accumbens , striatum and amygdala were bilateral in nature , while in prefrontal cortex -LRB- medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate combined -RRB- , left and right brain regions responded differentially to quinpirole .
9483561|Acute drug treatment increased dopamine tissue levels in nucleus accumbens and right prefrontal cortex , while the dopamine metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid , was decreased in amygdala .
9483561|In contrast , sensitization to quinpirole was associated with decreased dopamine levels in left prefrontal cortex , and increases in 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid levels in subcortical structures , particularly striatum and amygdala .
9483561|While the nucleus accumbens and striatum play a well known role in motor activation and sensitized behaviour , it is concluded that the amygdala and prefrontal cortex have significant modulatory influences on these processes , with the role of the prefrontal cortex being asymmetrical in nature .
9519062|The median percentage volume differences revealed overall reductions in the whole brain -LRB- 3 % -RRB- , temporal lobe -LRB- 6 % left , 9.5 % right -RRB- , and the amygdala / hippocampal complex -LRB- 6.5 % , 5.5 % -RRB- ; and increases in the lateral ventricles -LRB- 44 % , 36 % -RRB- , that were greatest in the body and occipital horns .
9519062|In men , substantial reductions were also evident in the amygdala and hippocampus , as well as the largest reductions of all in the parahippocampus -LRB- 14 % , 9 % -RRB- .
9522399|Functional MRI reveals left amygdala activation during emotion .
9522399|During sad mood , blood flow increased in the left amygdala and these changes correlated with shifts towards a negative affect .
9522399|A significant increase in signal intensity was found during sad as well as happy mood induction in the left amygdala .
9527653|The T2 relaxation time was measured in selected brain regions from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as well as in amygdala .
9527653|Mean T2 values of left amygdala were significantly higher in patients showing less favorable improvement after neuroleptic treatment in comparison to those who improved better .
9558644|Correlations to left hemisphere motor cortex , visual cortex , and amygdala are measured in long resting-state scans .
9561515|Volume measurements of the amygdala and hippocampus have been used reliably to study patients with temporal lobe epilepsy but have not extended to other limbic structures .
9561515|We performed volume measurements of hippocampus , amygdala , fornix and mamillary bodies in healthy individuals .
9561515|Measurements of the amygdala , hippocampus , fornix and mamillary bodies revealed significant differences in volume between right and left sides -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- .
9579686|A positive correlation was found in the pons , midbrain , hypothalamus , amygdala , the basal prefrontal cortex , insula and the right dorsal premotor cortex .
9596046|Meta-analysis 2 indicated that the inclusion of the amygdala in the region of interest significantly increased effect sizes across studies -LRB- effect size for the left hippocampus and amygdala , 0.67 ; for the right , 0.72 -RRB- , whereas variables such as illness duration , total slice width , magnet strength , the use of the intracranial volume as a covariate , measurement reliability , and study quality did not .
9596046|CONCLUSIONS : Schizophrenia is associated with a bilateral volumetric reduction of the hippocampus and probably of the amygdala as well .
9596046|Future quantitative magnetic resonance imaging studies evaluating the hippocampal volume should measure the hippocampus and amygdala separately and compare the volumetric reduction in these structures to that observed in other gray matter areas .
9624001|Conscious and unconscious emotional learning in the human amygdala .
9624001|A significant neural response was elicited in the right , but not left , amygdala to masked presentations of the conditioned angry face .
9624001|Unmasked presentations of the same face produced enhanced neural activity in the left , but not right , amygdala .
9624001|Our results indicate that , first , the human amygdala can discriminate between stimuli solely on the basis of their acquired behavioural significance , and second , this response is lateralized according to the subjects ' level of awareness of the stimuli .
9632050|Electrical amygdala kindling in alcohol-withdrawal kindled rats .
9632050|The purpose of the present investigation was to study electrical amygdala kindling in rats previously exposed to alcohol-withdrawal kindling .
9632050|Electrical kindling was initiated 28-35 days after the last alcohol dose by exposing the animals to daily electrical stimulations of the right amygdala .
9632050|The results showed that amygdala kindling was facilitated in alcohol-withdrawal kindled animals which showed spontaneous withdrawal seizure activity , compared with animals exposed to multiple episodes of alcohol withdrawal which did not develop withdrawal seizures or with animals exposed to a single episode of alcohol intoxication .
9645547|One rater measured five brain regions -LRB- temporal lobe , anterior and posterior hippocampus , amygdala , and temporal horn -RRB- on the left and right sides of the two non-reformatted and two reformatted scans to obtain inter-scan variance .
9648549|Animal studies implicate the amygdala and its connections in the recognition of aversive stimuli .
9648549|A recent PET study demonstrated that the human amygdala and left orbitofrontal cortex show substantial increases in regional cerebral blood flow -LRB- rCBF -RRB- during exposure to aversive odourants .
9648549|The aversive saline condition , when contrasted with the water condition , increased activity in the right amygdala , left anterior orbitofrontal cortex , medial thalamus , pregenual and dorsal anterior cingulate , and the right hippocampus .
9648549|The right amygdala , left orbitofrontal cortex and pregenual cingulate remained significantly activated when saline was compared with chocolate .
9648549|The present results indicate that the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex respond to aversive stimuli in both the olfactory and gustatory modalities , and highlight the role of the pregenual cingulate in negative emotional processing .
9661248|Several lines of evidence indicate a critical role of the piriform cortex -LRB- PC -RRB- in the kindling model of temporal lobe epilepsy , suggesting that the PC is part of an epileptic network that is pivotal in the genesis of kindling , facilitating , and intensifying the spread of seizures from a focus in amygdala , hippocampus , or other limbic brain regions to cortical and subcortical regions .
9661248|Kindling of the amygdala has been shown to induce long-lasting changes in synaptic efficacy in the ipsilateral PC comparable to abnormalities seen in epileptic foci , but the neurochemical alterations possibly underlying these functional changes are not known .
9661248|The possibility that the enhanced excitability of the PC in response to kindling is related to a reduction of GABAergic neurotransmission prompted us to examine if a lasting reduction in GABA-immunoreactive PC neurons is detectable after kindling of the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- in rats .
9661248|Furthermore , GABA immunoreactivity was determined in the BLA in order to investigate whether GABAergic neurons decrease in focal tissue , as previously suggested by neurochemical and immunocytochemical studies in amygdala-kindled rats .
9667575|abe@neurol.med.osaka-u.ac.jp Destructive lesions of the basal forebrain are often associated with memory impairment and this structure is thought to contribute to memory function by providing a cholinergic input to critical structures associated with memory such as the hippocampus and amygdala .
9689711|whitstup@ping.at Using magnetic resonance imaging of the brain , we examined volumetric measurements of total brain , hemispheres , lateral ventricles and the hippocampus/amygdala complex in male subjects -LRB- 41 first-episode schizophrenics , 30 chronic schizophrenic patients and 32 healthy controls -RRB- .
9694023|Study 1 -- Role of NMDA receptors in efferent transmission from the cat amygdala .
9694023|A series of three reports describes experiments designed to test the hypothesis that behavioral changes depend upon an N-methyl-D-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- receptor-based LTP of efferent transmission from the amygdala .
9694023|This first study characterizes the dose and time effects of injection of the NMDA receptor blocker 7-amino-phosphono-heptanoic acid -LRB- AP7 -RRB- on efferent transmission from the cat amygdala to the ventromedial hypothalamus -LRB- VMH -RRB- .
9694023|Effects of doses of 0.5-10mg / kg -LRB- i.v. -RRB- of AP7 on potentials evoked in the VMH by single pulse stimulation of the basal amygdala were examined .
9694023|In order to localize the action of the drug , concurrent measurements were taken of potentials evoked in the VMH by stimulation of the efferent fibers from the amygdala to the VMH -LRB- ventral amygdalofugal pathway , VAF -RRB- .
9694023|The data suggest that NMDA receptors intrinsic to the amygdala modulate excitatory efferent transmission from amygdala to VMH in the cat .
9738678|RESULTS : In both the low - and high-stimulation groups during VNS , brain BF was -LRB- a -RRB- increased in the rostral , dorsal-central medulla ; -LRB- b -RRB- increased in the right postcentral gyrus , -LRB- c -RRB- increased bilaterally in the hypothalami , thalami , and insular cortices , and in cerebellar hemispheres inferiorly ; and -LRB- d -RRB- decreased bilaterally in hippocampus , amygdala , and posterior cingulate gyri .
9742288|Rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium -LRB- 35 mg/kg i.p. -RRB- and bipolar electrodes were implanted into the right amygdala .
9766770|The schizophrenic patients also showed a smaller gray matter volume of the left posterior amygdala-hippocampal complex than the comparison subjects .
9766770|Both the patients with schizophrenia and those with affective psychosis had significant left-less-than-right asymmetry of the posterior amygdala-hippocampal complex .
9768464|Glucose metabolism was assessed using positron emission tomography in 41 comparisons , 15 predatory murderers , and nine affective murderers in left and right hemisphere prefrontal -LRB- medial and lateral -RRB- and subcortical -LRB- amygdala , midbrain , hippocampus , and thalamus -RRB- regions .
9807645|On the other hand , a left-sided prefrontal mechanism would inhibit the amygdala resulting in dampened autonomic output , hypoemotionality , and lack of emotional coloring that would in turn , be reported as feelings of `` unreality or detachment . ''
9808311|Intra - and interobserver variability of MRI-based volume measurements of the hippocampus and amygdala using the manual ray-tracing method .
9808311|rik.achten@rug.ac.be We studied the intra - and interobserver variability of volume measurments of the hippocampus -LRB- HC -RRB- and the amygdala as applied to the detection of HC atrophy in patients with complex partial seizures -LRB- CPE -RRB- , measuring the volumes of the HC and amygdala of 11 normal volunteers and 12 patients with presumed CPE , using the manual ray-tracing method .
9808311|The intra - and interobserver variability of the absolute volumes and of the normalised left-to-right volume differences -LRB- deltaV -RRB- between the HC -LRB- deltaV -LRB- HC -RRB- -RRB- , the amygdala -LRB- deltaV -LRB- A -RRB- -RRB- and the sum of both -LRB- deltaV -LRB- HCA -RRB- -RRB- were assessed .
9808311|In our mainly right-handed normals , the right HC and amygdala were on average 0.05 and 0.03 ml larger respectively than on the left .
9808311|The interobserver variability for volume measurements in normal subjects was 1.80 ml for the HC and 0.82 ml for the amygdala , the intraobserver variability roughly one third of these values .
9808371|In the anterior cortical and medial subnuclei of the amygdala there was a high concentration of Fos but there was no consistent difference between the two groups .
9811364|Stimulating/recording electrodes were implanted in the left amygdala -LRB- LAD -RRB- , right amygdala -LRB- RAD -RRB- and left bed nucleus -LRB- LBN -RRB- of the stria terminalis .
9817000|A substantial rise of met-enkephaline levels along with the maximum increase of D2-receptor density in the frontal cortex , amygdala , striatum , and hippocampus were observed in rats after learning .
9821068|For example , damage to the amygdala may be associated with an impaired ability to recognized emotional faces and a reduction of affect , especially anger , rage , and fear .
9821068|Seizures frequently emanate from the limbic system , and seizures that start in the amygdala can induce fear and perhaps even rage .
9821359|People with Huntington 's disease and people suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder show severe deficits in recognizing facial expressions of disgust , whereas people with lesions restricted to the amygdala are especially impaired in recognizing facial expressions of fear .
9826730|Hippocampal , but not amygdala , activity at encoding correlates with long-term , free recall of nonemotional information .
9826730|malkire@uci.edu Participation of two medial temporal lobe structures , the hippocampal region and the amygdala , in long-term declarative memory encoding was examined by using positron emission tomography of regional cerebral glucose .
9826730|No correlation was found between activity of either the left or right amygdala and recall .
9826730|The findings provide evidence for hippocampal involvement in long-term declarative memory encoding and for the view that the amygdala is not involved with declarative memory formation for nonemotional material .
9831467|Metabolic rate in the right amygdala predicts negative affect in depressed patients .
9831467|The role of the amygdala in major depression was investigated .
9831467|Using coregistration of PET and magnetic resonance images , regions were individually delineated for the amygdala and thalamus , the latter of which was used as a control region .
9831467|Within the depressed groups , right amygdalar rCMRglu was positively correlated with negative affect .
9831467|Thalamic rCMRglu was not related to negative affect , and amygdalar rCMRglu accounted for a significant portion of variance in depressives ' negative affect scores over and above the contribution of thalamic rCMRglu .
9845051|The surgery consisted of unilateral partial removal of the hippocampus along with the anterior temporal lobe and amygdala .
9922716|Compared to young subjects , aged controls showed volume reductions in amygdala -LRB- 17 % , p = 0.02 -RRB- , hippocampus -LRB- 15 % , p = 0.0001 -RRB- and temporal lobe -LRB- 22 % , p = 0.0001 -RRB- .
9922716|Compared to aged controls , Alzheimer 's subjects showed further volume reductions in amygdala -LRB- 33 % , p = 0.0001 -RRB- and hippocampus -LRB- 20 % , p = 0.006 -RRB- but not temporal lobe -LRB- 7 % , p = 0.15 -RRB- .
9922716|In Alzheimer 's subjects , left temporal lobe volume correlated strongly with the Mini Mental State -LRB- MMSE -RRB- score -LRB- adjusted r2 = 0.46 , p = 0.0006 -RRB- whereas right amygdala volume correlated inversely with the noncognitive ADAS score -LRB- adjusted r2 = 0.46 , p = 0.0006 -RRB- .
9922716|The authors conclude that significant volume changes occur in the temporal lobe in aging and in Alzheimer 's disease , with the greatest percentage reductions in the amygdala in Alzheimer 's disease .
9988836|Analysis of the main effect of schizophrenia on regional grey matter revealed significant reductions in -LRB- a -RRB- the right temporal pole , insula and amygdala , -LRB- b -RRB- the left temporal pole , insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex .
9989557|METHOD : In 36 patients with probable Alzheimer 's disease who experienced the 1995 earthquake in Kobe , Japan , memories of events surrounding the earthquake were examined as an index of emotional memory with the use of a semistructured interview , and amygdalar and hippocampal volumes were quantified by magnetic resonance imaging .
9989557|RESULTS : Irrespective of generalized brain atrophy and cognitive impairments , emotional memory was correlated more with normalized amygdalar volume -LRB- right and left averaged -RRB- than with normalized hippocampal volume .
9989557|General knowledge of the earthquake was correlated with neither amygdalar nor hippocampal volume .
9989557|CONCLUSIONS : The results indicate that impairment of emotional event memory in patients with Alzheimer 's disease is related to intensity of amygdalar damage and provide evidence of the amygdala 's involvement in emotional memory in humans .
9990084|A subcortical pathway to the right amygdala mediating `` unseen '' fear .
9990084|Neuroimaging studies have shown differential amygdala responses to masked -LRB- `` unseen '' -RRB- emotional stimuli .
9990084|How visual signals related to such unseen stimuli access the amygdala is unknown .
9990084|We used measures of right amygdala neural activity acquired from volunteer subjects viewing masked fear-conditioned faces to determine whether a colliculo-pulvinar pathway was engaged during processing of these unseen target stimuli .
9990084|Increased connectivity between right amygdala , pulvinar , and superior colliculus was evident when fear-conditioned faces were unseen rather than seen .
9990084|Right amygdala connectivity with fusiform and orbitofrontal cortices decreased in the same condition .
9990084|By contrast , the left amygdala , whose activity did not discriminate seen and unseen fear-conditioned targets , showed no masking-dependent changes in connectivity with superior colliculus or pulvinar .
9990084|These results suggest that a subcortical pathway to the right amygdala , via midbrain and thalamus , provides a route for processing behaviorally relevant unseen visual events in parallel to a cortical route necessary for conscious identification .
