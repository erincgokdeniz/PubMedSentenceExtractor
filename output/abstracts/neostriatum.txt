10336060|Tetanic stimulation of the subcortical white matter induced long-term potentiation of postsynaptic potentials and population spikes in the ethanol withdrawal rat neostriatum , while long-term depression was evoked in the naive rat neostriatum .
10336060|Dopamine also significantly depressed the induction of long-term potentiation in ethanol withdrawal rat neostriatum and this depressant effect was antagonized by the D2 antagonist L-sulpiride but not by the D1 antagonist SCH23390 .
10336060|The depression of long-term potentiation induction by activation of D2 receptor suggests that corticostriatal N-methyl-D-aspartate response or intracellular mechanisms involving in the induction of the long-term potentiation can be suppressed by D2 activation and that the D2 effects are inhibited in the neostriatum of ethanol withdrawal rats .

10448430|It has been shown that the number of surviving neurons in the right neostriatum dramatically increased following ischemia after lesions were made in the right substantia nigra -LRB- SN -RRB- , whereas no such protective effect was observed in the left neostriatum after left SN lesion .
10448430|Using a voltammetric technique , the present study measured the dopamine concentration in neostriatum during ischemia after unilateral dopamine depletion and correlated it with the postischemic neuronal damage in neostriatum of male and female rats .
10448430|In both genders , dopamine concentrations in the neostriatum of the intact side increased to 50-60 microM during ischemia while those of the lesion side were 15-30 microM .
10448430|In male rats , the number of surviving neurons in the right neostriatum -LRB- approximately 80 % as control -RRB- was significantly greater than that in the left neostriatum -LRB- approximately 20 % -RRB- after ipsilateral dopamine depletion , whereas in female animals , the number of surviving neurons in the right neostriatum -LRB- approximately 40 % -RRB- was about the same as that in the left neostriatum -LRB- approximately 35 % -RRB- after dopamine depletion .
10448430|These results indicate that the asymmetry in ischemic outcome after unilateral dopamine depletion in male rats is not due to the difference in residual dopamine in neostriatum .
10454508|To investigate the contribution of the dynorphin pathways to a tonic modulation of dopamine release , a microdialysis study was undertaken , with probes implanted in the substantia nigra and the ipsilateral neostriatum .
10454508|Perfusion of the substantia nigra with the nonselective antagonist naltrexone -LRB- NTX ; 1-10 microM -RRB- , the selective kappa-opoid receptor antagonist , nor-binaltorphimine -LRB- nor-BNI ; 1-10 microM -RRB- , and the selective mu-opioid receptor antagonist , D-Pen-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- CTOP ; 1-10 microM -RRB- produced an increase in dopamine release , both in substantia nigra and neostriatum .
10454508|Perfusion of the neostriatum with NTX , nor-BNI , or CTOP increased striatal dopamine , and dynorphin B release and increased dynorphin B in the ipsilateral substantia nigra .
10454508|The kappa-opioid agonist U-50 ,488 H -LRB- 10 microM -RRB- induced a decrease in dopamine levels , both in the substantia nigra and neostriatum , and a paradoxical increase in striatal aspartate levels .
10454508|The results suggest that opioid peptides , either dynorphins acting on kappa-opioid receptors or enkephalins acting on mu-opioid receptors , exert tonic inhibition on dopamine and dynorphin B release in both substantia nigra and neostriatum .
10461924|The stimulation of adenylyl cyclase -LRB- AC -RRB- by dopamine was investigated in membrane fractions of the forebrain areas mediorostral neostriatum/hyperstriatum ventrale -LRB- MNH -RRB- and lobus parolfactorius -LRB- LPO -RRB- of 8-day-old domestic chicks that had been raised under different social conditions : group A , socially isolated ; group B , imprinted on an acoustic stimulus ; group C , trained but nonimprinted ; and group D , reared in small groups .

10486183|d-Amphetamine-induced c-fos activation is reduced in the neostriatum deprived of DA afferents .
10486183|Dopaminergic grafts implanted into the denervated neostriatum induce a c-fos hyperexpression when challenged with d-amphetamine , which is correlated with the exaggerated compensation of d-amphetamine-induced rotation .
10486183|c-fos basal expression was low in the neostriatum and was increased by the administration of psychostimulants .
10486183|A c-fos hyperexpression was observed within the grafted neostriatum , which was correlated with the compensation of d-amphetamine - or cocaine-induced rotation .
10486183|Basal levels of Jun-B - and Krox-24-LI nuclei were high within the neostriatum .
10486183|In contrast , lesion of DA afferents of neostriatum decreased Krox-24 basal expression , an effect reversed by the grafts .
10486888|Effects of bilateral lesions of the thalamic parafascicular nucleus -LRB- Pf -RRB- and bilateral microinjections of scopolamine -LRB- cholinolytic -RRB- and carbacholine -LRB- cholinomimetic -RRB- into rat neostriatum on the strength of pressing the bar at different stages of acquisition of food-procuring reflex were studied in 51 rats .
10494576|Thalamic gating was recorded using electrodes which were chronically implanted into the nucleus ovoidalis thalami and the neostriatum caudale -LRB- field L -RRB- , respectively .
10495440|Here , we show that the HA also is the origin of a set of intratelencephalic projections with terminal fields in the lateral part of the frontal neostriatum , the shell surrounding the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum , the lobus parolfactorius surrounding area X , the nucleus interface , auditory fields L1 and L3 , the shelf underlying the high vocal center , the dorsolateral caudal neostriatum , the dorsocaudal part of the nucleus robustus archistriatalis , and the ventral archistriatum .
10499520|Similar to reports in other songbird species , we detected AR mRNA-containing cells in several song control nuclei , including the high vocal center -LRB- HVc -RRB- , the medial and lateral portions of the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum , and the robust nucleus of the archistriatum .
10499520|We detected ER alpha expression in the medial portion of HVc -LRB- also called paraHVc -RRB- and along the medial border of the caudal neostriatum .
10499520|ER beta was not expressed in HVc , in the medial and lateral portions of the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum , in the robust nucleus of the archistriatum , or in area X .
10499520|In contrast , ER beta mRNA-containing cells were detected in the caudomedial neostriatum and medial preoptic area in a pattern reminiscent of P450 aromatase expression in the same brain regions in other songbirds .
10499520|Nonetheless , the overlapping expression of ER beta - and aromatase-producing cells in the caudomedial neostriatum suggests that locally synthesized estrogens may act via ER beta , in addition to ER alpha , to mediate seasonal or developmental effects on nearby song nuclei -LRB- e.g. HVc -RRB- .

10502280|Three-dimensional reconstruction from Nissl-stained sections of the rat brain revealed that the MrD is a flat , pan-shaped zone between the neostriatum and globus pallidus .
10502280|Our results thus suggested that the MrD is a distinct part and a universal structure in the neostriatum of the mammalian brain and might play an important role in the mechanism of learning and memory .
10515972|While previous studies have identified rhythmically firing neurons -LRB- RFNs -RRB- in monkey neostriatum and these rhythmic firing patterns have been shown to evolve in neostriatal tonically active neurons -LRB- TANs -RRB- after dopamine input depletion , the activity patterns of RFNs during motor behavior are still far from completely understood .

10530506|Analysis of the neostriatum and SN ipsilateral to the lesion revealed that toluene -LRB- 80 ppm , but not 40 ppm -RRB- counteracted the 6-OH DA-induced reductions of DA tissue levels both within the SN and the neostriatum .

10555786|In addition to loss of dopamine in this model , it has recently been shown that markers of serotonin -LRB- 5-hydroxytryptamine , 5-HT -RRB- innervation including 5-HT content , synaptosomal uptake of -LSB- 3H -RSB- 5-HT and -LSB- 3H -RSB- citalopram binding were elevated in the dorsal neostriatum of the weaver mutant mouse .
10555786|Using quantitative autoradiography of specific ligands for dopamine and 5-HT uptake sites as well as serotonin 5-HT1 and 5-HT2A receptors , we found an increased density of 5-HT uptake sites and 5-HT1 receptors restricted to the dorsal portion of the neostriatum of the weaver mouse .
10555786|In contrast , 5-HT2A receptors were increased in both the dorsal and ventral portions of the rostral neostriatum as well as the nucleus accumbens .
10556631|Cholinergic neurons in the rat basal forebrain and in the neostriatum were depleted after the injection of either 192-IgG or p75-TCS .
10556631|In contrast , p75-TCS was potent and caused a selective and specific depletion of cholinergic neurons in the neostriatum .

10559560|To investigate the involvement of NADPH-diaphorase -LRB- NADPH-d -RRB- - containing neurons in Alzheimer 's disease -LRB- AD -RRB- , NADPH-d enzyme histochemistry in vibratome sections was applied to the superior frontal and superior temporal cortex and the neostriatum in 5 AD and 6 aged control brains .
10559560|Despite slight morphological neuronal changes in the cortex of AD , we found no significant difference in the number of NADPH-d-positive neurons in both cortex and neostriatum between control and AD cases .
10559560|In order to check whether nNOS-immunoreactive neurons are identical to NADPH-d-positive neurons in the human brain , we examined the frontal and temporal cortex and neostriatum of normal human brains in serial cryostat sections .
10561401|We sought to determine whether one action of androgens is to functionally modulate the development of synaptic transmission in two brain nuclei , the lateral part of the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- LMAN -RRB- and the robust nucleus of the archistriatum -LRB- RA -RRB- , that are critical for song learning and production .

10923989|In the denervated neostriatum , we have shown that not only are the tyrosine hydroxylase positive boutons missing , but also the medium sized densely spiny output cells have fewer spines .
10923989|In a recent stereological study we were able to show that there is a loss of approximately 20 % of asymmetric synapses in the lesioned neostriatum by 1 mo after the lesion .
10923989|So far we have evidence suggesting that there is no obvious preferential loss of synapses from either D1 or D2 receptor immunostained dendrites in the neostriatum with damaged dopamine innervation .

1096570|It now seems adequately confirmed that the production of dyskinesia in monkeys is biochemically related to dopaminergic systems in the neostriatum .
10980483|To determine whether the neostriatum receives overlapping projections from two somatosensory cortical areas , the anterograde tracers biotinylated dextran amine -LRB- BDA -RRB- and fluoro-ruby -LRB- FR -RRB- were injected into the whisker representations of primary -LRB- SI -RRB- and secondary -LRB- SII -RRB- somatosensory cortex .
10980483|Reconstructions of labeled terminals and their beaded varicosities in the neostriatum and thalamus were analyzed quantitatively to compare the extent of overlapping projections to both subcortical structures .
10980483|Corticostriatal projections from focal sites in both somatosensory areas exhibited substantial amounts of divergence within the dorsolateral neostriatum .
10980483|Most of the labeled terminals were concentrated in densely packed arborizations that occupied lamellar-shaped regions along the dorsolateral edge of the neostriatum .
10980483|We found that the proportion of overlapping projections to the neostriatum was moderately correlated with the amount of overlap observed in the thalamus .
10980483|This result strongly indicates that specific sites in the dorsolateral neostriatum receive convergent projections from corresponding somatotopic representations in SI and SII , but also suggests that some of the corticostriatal divergence may reflect neostriatal integration of somatosensory information from noncorresponding representations in SI and SII .
10981941|Involvement of the parafascicular nucleus of the thalamus and the cholinoreactive system of the neostriatum in controlling a food-procuring reflex in rats at different stages of learning .
10981941|A model of a Skinner box food-procuring reflex in rats was used to study the relationship between the strength applied to a pedal and disruption of the parafascicular nucleus of the thalamus and microinjections of the cholinolytic scopolamine and the cholinomimetic carbachol into the neostriatum at different stages of learning .

10981941|In trained rats at the stage of recovery the reflex -LRB- i.e. , strong pedal presses were reinforced only during exposure to the conditioned signal -RRB- , lesioning of the parafascicular nucleus of the thalamus had the effect that the time required for recovery of the reflex became dependent on the level of pre-operative training ; scopolamine microinjections into the neostriatum of rats achieving high levels of correct performances of the reflex only after surgery led to sharp degradation in performance of the reflex on the day of microinjections ; microinjection of carbachol into the neostriatum of rats with low post-operative levels of performance of the reflex had no effect on this measure .

10984658|5-HT fibers in the neostriatum were dark-stained , of quite fine diameter -LRB- < 0.6 microm -RRB- , and they contained small , round varicosities -LRB- diameter , usually 0.5-1 .0 microm , but some > 1.0 microm -RRB- .
10984658|The above results suggest that the 5-HT-dominated , raphe-striatal pathway is optimally arranged for modulating the activity of both the intrinsic and the projection neurons of the neostriatum .

11026489|By means of a high performance liquid chromatographic method with electrochemical detection , we found a 4-fold increase in the non-enzymatically formed spin trap product , 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid -LRB- 2,3-DHBA -RRB- , with neither L-DOPA nor 6-OHDOPA having an effect on 2,3-DHBA content of the neostriatum .
11026489|Basal content of 2,5-DHBA , the enzymatically formed spin trap product , was 4-fold higher vs. 2,3-DHBA in the neostriatum of untreated rats , while L-DOPA and 6-OHDOPA each reduced formation of 2,5-DHBA .
11026489|We conclude that DA innervation normally suppresses * OH formation , and that the antiparkinsonian drug L-DOPA has no effect -LRB- 2,3-DHBA -RRB- or slightly reduces -LRB- 2,5-DHBA -RRB- * OH formation in the neostriatum , probably by virtue of its bathing the system of newly formed * OH .

11036238|The data suggest that while both D1A and D1B receptors mediate dopaminergic responses in many neurons of the avian striatum , primarily D1A receptors mediate dopaminergic responses in the archistriatum and the neostriatum , while primarily D1B receptors mediate dopaminergic responses in the hyperstriatum ventrale and the thalamus .
1103764|The effect of microinjections of morphine and haloperidol into the neostriatum and the nucleus accumbens on self-stimulation behaviour .
1103764|The effect of stereotaxic injections of morphine and haloperidol via permanently implanted cannulas into the neostriatum , the nucleus accumbens or the ventricular system was studied on self-stimulation behaviour of rats with electrodes implanted into the ventral tegmentum .
1103764|The self-stimulation rate was depressed by injections of haloperidol into the neostriatum or into the nucleus accumbens .
1103764|Unilateral injections of haloperidol into the neostriatum depressed the self-stimulation rate either with applications ipsilateral to the electrode or contralateral to the electrode .
1103764|Bilateral applications of haloperidol into the neostriatum -LRB- 2 X 2.5 mug -RRB- were more effective as unilateral applications -LRB- 5 mug -RRB- and were more effective as applications into the ventricular system -LRB- 5 mug -RRB- .
1103764|Morphine had a strong depressant action on self-stimulation when applied into the ventricular system and was ineffective when applied into the neostriatum .
1103764|It is concluded that these results do not favour the hypothesis that morphine interferes with dopaminergic transmission with the neostriatum .
11041539|The intravenous administration of cumulative doses -LRB- 1-4 mg/kg -RRB- of morphine , dose-dependently increased the firing rate of dopaminergic neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens and neostriatum , while the same doses inhibited the activity of pars reticulata neurons of the substantia nigra .

11082495|In dorsolateral neostriatum , a role for N - , P - and Q-type channels was demonstrated for discrete stimulations , whilst at least one other unidentified channel was also involved in dopamine release on ` burst ' stimulations .
11082495|Similarly , in the medial axis of the neostriatum , N - , P - and Q-type channels were involved in dopamine release for discrete stimulations , and N - , Q - and at least one other channel type for ` burst ' stimulations .
11082495|In the medial axis of the neostriatum there was a smaller contribution by N - and P-type channels and the unidentified component , but a greater Q-type contribution to DA release .
11082495|In summary , this study suggests that there is heterogeneity in the distribution of functional voltage-operated calcium channel subtypes in the neostriatum , and differences in subtype recruitment for different firing patterns .
11108615|The number of ZENK-ir cells in ventral caudo-medial neostriatum -LSB- NCMv -RSB- was significantly higher in females exposed to longer songs than in those exposed to shorter songs , whereas variation in the total duration of song exposure yielded no significant differences in ZENK expression .

11173929|However , the density of serotonin fibers was markedly increased throughout the 6-OHDA-depleted neostriatum 1 year later .
11177229|Administration of 15 microg amphetamine into the rostral neostriatum prevented picrotoxin-induced lethal seizures and reduced its negative effects on active avoidance behavior .
11182640|Biparietal diameter , ventricular size , cholinergic interneurons in the neostriatum and dopaminergic projection neurons in the substantia nigra were analyzed at each stage .
11185904|To determine whether the neostriatum receives overlapping projections from two somatosensory cortical areas , the anterograde tracers biotinylated dextran amine -LRB- BDA -RRB- and fluoro-ruby -LRB- FR -RRB- were injected into the whisker representations of primary -LRB- SI -RRB- and secondary -LRB- SII -RRB- somatosensory cortex .
11185904|Reconstructions of labeled terminals and their beaded varicosities in the neostriatum and thalamus were analyzed quantitatively to compare the extent of overlapping projections to both subcortical structures .
11185904|Corticostriatal projections from focal sites in both somatosensory areas exhibited substantial amounts of divergence within the dorsolateral neostriatum .
11185904|Most of the labeled terminals were concentrated in densely packed arborizations that occupied lamellar-shaped regions along the dorsolateral edge of the neostriatum .
11185904|We found that the proportion of overlapping projections to the neostriatum was moderately correlated with the amount of overlap observed in the thalamus .
11185904|This result strongly indicates that specific sites in the dorsolateral neostriatum receive convergent projections from corresponding somatotopic representations in SI and SII , but also suggests that some of the corticostriatal divergence may reflect neostriatal integration of somatosensory information from noncorresponding representations in SI and SII .

11195207|Bilateral microinjections of the muscarinic receptors agonists -LRB- oxotremorine -RRB- into the neostriatum enhanced the tonic component of instrumental movements , suppressed the phasic component and increased the postural component 's amplitude .
11195207|These changes were much more obvious in microinjections of the non-selective muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol due , probably , to its effect on both the M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors of the neostriatum efferent neurones .

11195210|The data obtained suggest that neostriatum contributes to a coping response by selecting an appropriate behavioural strategy in stressful situation .
11223911|Previously it was shown that tyrosine hydroxylase was activated and dopamine synthesis was enhanced in the neostriatum region in mice and rats by the intracerebroventricular administration of calcium through a calmodulin-dependent system .
11251317|However , unlike in mammals where in the neostriatum -LSB- outside the nucleus accumbens/olfactory tubercle complex -LRB- NA/OT -RRB- -RSB- these receptors exhibit only slight dorsolateral -LRB- D -LRB- 2 -RRB- high , D -LRB- 1 -RRB- low -RRB- to ventromedial -LRB- D -LRB- 1 -RRB- high , D -LRB- 2 -RRB- low -RRB- gradients that co mingle extensively , in the anole striatum outside the NA/OT there was a striking laminar pattern , with little if any overlap between D -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- high in a dorsal band -RRB- and D -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- high ventral to the D -LRB- 2 -RRB- band -RRB- distributions .

1126382|Results are discussed in terms of the structure -- activity relationships for the stimulation of different types of dopamine receptive structures within the neostriatum .
11264324|We investigated this issue by characterizing the deterioration of song that occurs after deafening in young adult birds and the degree to which that deterioration is reduced by age or by lesions of the anterior forebrain that were directed at the lateral portion of the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- LMAN -RRB- .
11268010|The most substantial auditory system inputs are derived from the frontal lateral neostriatum -LRB- NFl -RRB- and supracentral nucleus of the lateral neostriatum -LRB- NLs -RRB- ; these project primarily to the lateral HVo and lateral HVo surround .
11268010|The medial HVo and surround receive only sparse or modest input from auditory nuclei , including the caudomedial neostriatum -LRB- NCM -RRB- , neostriatum intermedium pars lateralis -LRB- NIL -RRB- , Fields L1 and L3 , and the neostriatum intermedium pars ventrolateralis -LRB- NIVL -RRB- .
11268010|Other sources of input to the HVo surround include the hyperstriatum accessorium -LRB- HA -RRB- , the supralaminar area of the frontal neostriatum -LRB- NAs -RRB- , the ventral anterior archistriatum -LRB- AAv -RRB- , the medial archistriatum -LRB- Am -RRB- and the medial HV .
11268010|Both the ventral paleostriatum -LRB- VP -RRB- and ventral part of the central nucleus of the lateral neostriatum -LRB- NLc -RRB- project to HVo but not to the surround .

11304711|Gamma-aminobutyric acid -LRB- GABA -RRB- is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the neostriatum .
11304711|The cellular localization of the second subunit of GABA -LRB- B -RRB- receptor protein , i.e. , GABA -LRB- B -RRB- R2 immunoreactivity , in the rat neostriatum is not yet known .
11304711|By using a new commercially available specific antibody against GABA -LRB- B -RRB- R2 , immunofluorescence was performed to investigate the cellular expression of GABA -LRB- B -RRB- R2 in neurochemically identified subpopulations of neurons in the rat neostriatum .
11304711|Immunoreactivity for GABA -LRB- B -RRB- R2 was primarily found in the neuropil of the rat neostriatum .
11304711|In addition , perikarya and most of the neuropilar elements in the neostriatum that expressed glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 immunoreactivity were found to be GABA -LRB- B -RRB- R2-negative .
11304711|Moreover , a vast number of SV2-immunoreactive profiles and a number of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive profiles in the neuropil of the neostriatum were found to display GABA -LRB- B -RRB- R2 immunoreactivity .
11304711|Immunoreactivity for GABA -LRB- B -RRB- R2 is likely to localize in neuropilar elements of the neostriatum that may belong to non-GABAergic elements .
11304711|These findings provide anatomical evidence of GABA -LRB- B -RRB- R2 receptor localization in the neostriatum that may have an important functional implication of the GABA -LRB- B -RRB- - mediated functions in neurons of the neostriatum .

11311534|Unbiased stereology using the optical fractionator was used to estimate the total number of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons in neostriatum of experimental and control rats .
11311534|Administration of bicuculline during the post-proliferative phase significantly reduced parvalbumin-immunoreactive neuron number in the neostriatum .

11311789|Microinjections of cholera toxin B subunit were made into the area of the neostriatum that receives input from the primary somatosensory barrel cortex -LRB- SI -RRB- in the rat .
11311789|When injections were restricted to the neostriatum , retrograde labelling was found in layer V of both SI cortices .
11311789|An earlier anterograde study suggested two inputs from the SI to the neostriatum .
11311789|The present results indicate that one input to the somatosensory area of the neostriatum arises bilaterally from neurons between the barrels of the SI , while the topographic pathway from below the barrels is present only ipsilaterally .

11328659|For in vivo evaluation , PLAGA microspheres containing fluorescently-labelled ODNs were stereo-taxically administered to the neostriatum of the rat brain and biodistribution of ODNs monitored after 48 h. Administration of free fluorescently-labelled ODNs to the neostriatum resulted in a punctate cellular distribution of ODNs after 24 h with little or no ODN remaining in the neostriatum after 48 h .

11391638|Compared with the cerebellar molecular layer and area CA3 , where nearly every dendritic spine was labeled , less than half the spines were labeled in CA1 , dentate gyrus , and neostriatum .
11392629|A combination of anatomical and pharmacological research in rats has implicated M4 receptors in the ventrolateral neostriatum in the generation of tremulous jaw movements .
11394724|These findings confirm the role of the neostriatum in skill learning and highlight the importance of mechanisms resulting in cortical and cerebellar neuronal activity decreases in this type of learning .
11396718|A high density of TH-ir basket-like structures was observed in the caudomedial neostriatum , an area involved in song perception and recognition .
11396718|In most males , a high density of TH-ir fibers outlined the telencephalic song control nuclei including the high vocal center , the nucleus robustus archistriatalis , the nucleus interfascialis , the lateral and medial parts of the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum , and area X of the lobus parolfactorius .

11434974|tomas.a.reader@umontreal.ca Serotonin -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- uptake sites , or transporters , were measured in the neostriatum -LRB- caudate putamen -RRB- of wild type -LRB- + / + -RRB- mice and heterozygous -LRB- wv / + -RRB- and homozygous -LRB- wv/wv -RRB- weaver , as well as in heterozygous Lurcher -LRB- Lc / + -RRB- mutants .
11434974|These topological surveys were carried out by quantitative ligand binding autoradiography using the uptake site antagonist -LSB- 3H -RSB- - citalopram as a probe of innervation densities in four quadrants of the rostral neostriatum and in two halves of the caudal neostriatum .
11434974|This reorganization of the 5-HT system in the neostriatum was more obvious in the wv/wv and is compatible with the hypothesis that the postnatal dopaminergic deficiencies that characterize weaver mutants lead to a sprouting of fibers and thus constitute a genetic model of dopaminergic denervation that leads to a 5-HT hyperinnervation .

11454925|The QTL is not the DAT gene itself -LRB- Dat1 , chromosome 13 -RRB- , but a powerful modulator of DAT expression in neostriatum .
11454925|The results suggest that there is a gene -LRB- s -RRB- on proximal chromosome 19 that strongly influences DAT expression in neostriatum and may influence psychostimulant-induced activity and thermal responses .
11457589|We demonstrate interspecies differences and heterogeneity in expression and function of glycine receptors within the same neuronal population in the neostriatum .
11458542|Because dopamine and glutamate are major neurotransmitters of the neostriatum , we evaluated the profile of cocaine - or methamphetamine-evoked dopamine and glutamate overflow in the caudate putamen , nucleus accumbens , ventral tegmental area , and substantia nigra compacta of the rat brain .
11458542|Acute injection of methamphetamine or cocaine did not change extracellular levels of glutamate in the neostriatum .
11458542|Moreover , the sensitized augmentation of locomotor activity observed by us and others in response to a challenge injection of cocaine is not dependent on elevation of the extracellular concentration of dopamine in the neostriatum .
11458542|We are currently investigating the hypothesis that cocaine activates peptidergic systems of the neostriatum and that these systems modulate the synaptic release of dopamine in response to psychostimulants .
11459921|We hypothesize that primary subcortical damage to structures in the thalamus and neostriatum , together with secondary frontal lobe dysfunction , combine to yield the pattern of neuropsychological impairment and neuropsychological sparing that was found .
11465631|METHODS : Rats received bilateral implantations of guide cannulae into either nucleus accumbens , neostriatum , SNr , or control sites in the cortex or brainstem .
11465631|Nucleus accumbens and neostriatum injections were less potent than those in SNr , but more potent than injections into the control regions .

11483308|To reveal the mechanisms underlying the postischemic neuronal damage , the spontaneous activities , evoked postsynaptic potentials and membrane properties of spiny neurons in rat neostriatum were compared before and after transient forebrain ischemia using intracellular recording and staining techniques in vivo .
11483308|In control animals the membrane properties of spiny neurons were about the same between the left and right neostriatum but the inhibitory synaptic transmission was stronger in the left striatum .
11483308|These results indicate the depression of excitatory monosynaptic transmission , inhibitory synaptic transmission and excitability of spiny neurons after transient forebrain ischemia whereas the excitatory polysynaptic transmission in neostriatum was potentiated .
11483308|The facilitation of excitatory polysynaptic transmission is stronger in the right neostriatum than in the left neostriatum after ischemia .
11483308|The suppression of inhibitory component and the facilitation of excitatory polysynaptic transmission may contribute to the pathogenesis of neuronal injury in neostriatum after transient cerebral ischemia .
1149829|The brain lesion technique was used to investigate the role of the paleostriatum and the nigro-neostriatum in harmine-induced tremor and in its antagonism by dopaminergic agonists , apomorphine , 1-dopa , piribedil , d - and l-amphetamine .
1149829|The data suggest that the integrity of the paleostriatum is more important than that of the neostriatum for the mediation of harmine tremor and its antagonism by dopaminergic agonists .

1151755|The two stereoisomers of amphetamine were equally potent as inhibitors of accumulation in the cortex , whereas d-amphetamine was approximately 3-fold more potent than l-amphetamine in the neostriatum .
1151755|This showed that the apparent releasing action of d-amphetamine in the neostriatum was not due to blockade of reuptake of spontaneously released material and that d-amphetamine itself must be taken up to evoke a releasing action .
1151755|In the cortex , uptake inhibition of 3H-norepinephrine was greater than release over a wide concentration range , while in the neostriatum the two actions were essentially identical in magnitude for 3H-dopamine .
1151755|In the neostriatum , on the other hand , there is releasing action of 3H-dopamine by d-amphetamine -LRB- which is stronger than that in the cortex -RRB- , but the apparent blockade of `` uptake '' is of questionable significance and appears to result from the release of previously accumulated 3H-dopamine PMID : 1151755 -LSB- PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE -RSB-

11551672|In the neostriatum , a brain region that is associated with movement in animals , NMDA channels are known to involve in the motor control .
11551672|Our previous report -LRB- Lai et al. , 2000 , Neuroscience 98 , 493-500 -RRB- has shown that a single dose of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides that are specific to NR1 subunit results in blockage of the gene expression of NR1 as well as NR2A subunits in the neostriatum .
11551672|In the present study , antisense oligodeoxynucleotides that are specific to NR2B -LRB- ANR2B -RRB- were then employed as molecular tools to further investigate the molecular interactions of NMDA receptor subunits in the neostriatum .

11551672|However , the mRNA levels of NR1 , NR2A , NR2C and NR2D in the ANR2B-treated neostriatum were found to be unchanged .
11551672|After two days of injection , NR2B immunoreactivity was found to decrease in the ANR2B-treated neostriatum by immunofluorescence -LRB- -35.1 % -RRB- .

1215445|Jackson DM , Andn NE , Dahlstrm A. Dopamine -LRB- 5 to 50 mug -RRB- applied bilaterally to the nucleus accumbens of reserpine-nialamide pretreated rats produced a marked dose-dependent rise in coordinated locomotor activity , devoid of stereotypies such as gnawing , rearing and licking seen after dopamine application -LRB- 50 mug -RRB- to the neostriatum .
1215445|Bilateral application of trifluoperazine -LRB- 2.5 mug -RRB- to the nucleus accumbens completely blocked the effect of systemically administered d-amphetamine -LRB- 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg -RRB- , but similar application to the area of the central nucleus of the amygdala or the neostriatum was much less effective .

12170604|Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase in rat neostriatum : properties of the enzyme in crude homogenates .
12170604|Homogenates of rat neostriatum hydrolysed cGMP faster than cAMP at both high -LRB- 100 microM -RRB- and low -LRB- 1 microM -RRB- substrate concentrations , although the hydrolysis of both nucleotides exhibited similar kinetic properties .
12170604|In homogenates of neostriatum cAMP could almost completely block cGMP hydrolysis and vice versa .
12170604|Preliminary studies of the effect of a Ca -LRB- 2 + -RRB- - dependent endogenous activator preparation on the hydrolysis of cyclic nucleotides in homogenates of rat neostriatum showed a specific activation of cGMP hydrolysis at low nucleotide concentrations .
12170604|These observations raise the possibility that cAMP and cGMP may be hydrolysed by the same enzyme in rat neostriatum , and that an endogenous activating factor may determine the relative affinities of the enzyme for the two nucleotides .
12170605|Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase in rat neostriatum : multiple isoelectric forms with similar kinetic properties .
12170605|Separation of multiple forms of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase from the soluble supernatant fraction of rat neostriatum by isoelectric focusing yielded five separate peaks of cyclic nucleotide hydrolysing activity .
12170605|Isoelectric focusing of the soluble supernatant of rat cerebellum gave rise to a slightly different pattern of isoelectric forms from the neostriatum , indicating a different cellular distribution of the isoelectric forms of PDE in rat brain .
12170605|Polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis of the soluble supernatant of rat neostriatum also generated a characteristic pattern of five separate peaks of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity , each of which hydrolysed both cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP .

12222067|Chronic experiments with 10 dogs were conducted to study effects of bilateral microinjections of the nonselective agonist of the muscarinic receptors carbachol , nonselective blocker of the muscarinic receptors scopolamine and selective blocker M1 of the muscarinic receptors pyrensepine on the instrumental defensive reflex in the neostriatum to sustain a given flexion amplitude and posture adjustment .
12222067|These findings are interpreted in the light of the concept of two neostriatum efferent outputs with opposite effects on respective targets and the muscarinic and dopamine receptors as their triggers and blockers .
12222067|Results of the experiment bring to the conclusion that activation or blockage of the muscarinic receptors in the neostriatum can modify an existing motor behavior and compensate motor pathology in dogs .

12243260|These data , along with data published in the literature , are used to suggest the hypothesis that the actions of oxotremorine are mediated not only via muscarinic M2 but also via M1 receptors in the neostriatum .
12243267|The effects of chronic administration of phenamine -LRB- 15 microg -RRB- into the neostriatum and bicucculline -LRB- 5 microg -RRB- in the globus pallidus of rats on the performance of avoidance behavior in a shuttle box were studied .
12243267|Activation of the dopaminergic system of the neostriatum compensated for decreases in avoidance behavior due to surgical trauma , increased the intensity of spontaneous activity in the `` open field , '' and induced motor stereotypy .
12243267|Simultaneous treatment with phenamine into the neostriatum and bicucculline into the globus pallidus resulted in compensation for the inhibitory effects of bicucculline .
122710|The effects of a low protein diet during gestation , lactation , and after weaning on the anatomical development of a subcortical nucleate formation , the neostriatum , and a reticulate formation , the diagonal band of Broca , were studied .
122710|At 10 , 30 , and 90 days the volume of the neostriatum was decreased in the experimental rats .
122710|However , the percent of the brain volume that was neostriatum was unaffected at each of these ages .

1234757|Although the significance of dopaminergic -- cholinergic interactions in the neostriatum could not be elucidated on the basis of these histochemical data , the thesis was advanced that dopamine neurons in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra also contained AChE , possibly to inactivate acetylcholine released from cholinergic fibers afferent to this neural structure .
12364516|This pathway consists of a loop serially connecting area X in the basal ganglia , the medial portion of the dorsolateral nucleus of thalamus -LRB- DLM -RRB- , and the pallial lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- lMAN -RRB- .
1236760|This response was probably mediated by the small remaining stores of DA in the neostriatum .

12372733|METHODS : We identified seven unrelated patients with a distinct MR imaging pattern consisting of hypomyelination and atrophy of the basal ganglia -LRB- neostriatum -RRB- and cerebellum -LRB- H-ABC -RRB- .
12372733|Follow-up MR imaging demonstrated atrophy of the cerebral white matter , neostriatum , and cerebellum , which was most pronounced in the most clinically severe cases .
12382268|Previous studies suggested that the vocal motor system in budgerigars receives auditory information from the lateral frontal neostriatum -LRB- NFl -RRB- .
12382268|In the present study , we confirm this hypothesis by showing that infusions of the GABA agonist muscimol into NFl reduce the strength of auditory responses in a telencephalic vocal motor nucleus , the central nucleus of the lateral neostriatum -LRB- NLc -RRB- .

12390526|Effect of single and repeated methamphetamine treatment on neurotransmitter release in substantia nigra and neostriatum of the rat .
12390526|The main purpose of this study was to characterize the initial neurotransmission cascade elicited by methamphetamine , analysing simultaneously with in vivo microdialysis monoamine , amino acid and neuropeptide release in substantia nigra and neostriatum of the rat .
12390526|The main effect of a single systemic dose of methamphetamine -LRB- 15 mg/kg , subcutaneously -RRB- was an increase in dopamine levels , both in substantia nigra -LRB- approximately 10-fold -RRB- and neostriatum -LRB- approximately 40-fold -RRB- , accompanied by a significant , but lesser , increase in dynorphin B -LRB- approximately two-fold , in both regions -RRB- , and a decrease in monoamine metabolites .
12390526|Dopamine K + - stimulated release was decreased following repeated methamphetamine administration compared with that following saline , both in the substantia nigra -LRB- by approximately 65 % -RRB- and neostriatum -LRB- by approximately 20 % -RRB- .

1241390|The injection of carbachol -LRB- 1 mug -RRB- into the neostriatum produced hyperkinetic dyskinesias -LRB- 86 % -RRB- of long duration , minimal circling -LRB- both directions -RRB- -LRB- 10 % -RRB- , and catalepsy -LRB- 29 % -RRB- .
1241390|Saline injections in the neostriatum or globus pallidus produced no motor disturbance .
12417682|One of these areas , the neostriatum caudolaterale -LRB- NCL -RRB- of pigeons , has been functionally compared with the mammalian prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- because of its prominent role in spatial delay and reversal tasks and its innervation by the dopaminergic system that modulates these functions .

12447935|Many BrdU-labeled cells persisted in the striatum and cortex adjacent to infarcts , but at 35 days after tMCAO only BrdU-labeled cells in the neostriatum expressed neuronal markers .
12447935|Newly generated cells in the injured neostriatum expressed markers of medium spiny neurons , which characterize most neostriatal neurons lost after tMCAO .
12447935|Moreover , neuroblasts in the injured neostriatum appear to differentiate into a region-appropriate phenotype , which suggests that the mature brain is capable of replacing some neurons lost after ischemic injury .

12449067|It was shown that repeated introduction of the psychostimulants leads to a significant increase in the content of all four neuroactive amino acids in neostriatum dyalisates .
12449067|The massive increase in the extracellular content of taurine probably reflects hyperactivation of the glutamatergic transmission in the neostriatum and may serve as a marker of neurotoxicity .
12457264|Brain regions putatively identified in mediating the behavioral and neurochemical effects of cocaine , such as the frontal cortex , neostriatum , and hippocampus , were microdissected and used for immunoblotting experiments .

12605901|We also examined the influence of acute or repeated injections of cocaine on the number of tyrosine kinase B and C receptors immunoreactive neuronal profiles in the rat neostriatum and nucleus accumbens .
12605901|Following an acute injection of cocaine -LRB- 15 mg/kg , i.p. -RRB- , there were significant decreases in the number of tyrosine kinase B and C receptors immunoreactive profiles in specific regions of the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens relative to saline-pretreated rats .
12605901|One or 14 days following the last of seven daily injections of 15 mg/kg cocaine or saline there were no differences in the numbers of tyrosine kinase B or C receptors immunoreactive neuronal profiles between these treatment groups.Collectively , the present results indicate that tyrosine kinase B and C receptors in the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens are co-localized in enkephalin-positive and enkephalin-negative neuronal profiles , which suggests that the striatal medium spiny neurons expressing tyrosine kinase B and C receptors include those that project to the pallidum or the ventral mesencephalon .
12605901|The current results also show that an acute injection of cocaine results in a decrease in the number of tyrosine kinase B and C receptors immunoreactive neuronal profiles in specific regions of the nucleus accumbens and neostriatum , indicating that cocaine-induced increases in extracellular dopamine in the striatal complex result in compensatory decreases in the expression of tyrosine kinase B and C receptors .

12617307|Administration of corticoliberin -LRB- 0.25 microg -RRB- into the neostriatum induced the expression of mRNA encoded by the early genes c-fos , jun B , and NGFIA in both the neostriatum itself and in its efferent structures , particularly the nucleus accumbens and various parts of the cortex .

12684471|If dopamine influenced neurogenesis , the effects would likely be pronounced in the neostriatum .
12684471|Therefore , we examined whether dopamine influenced neostriatal neurogenesis by influencing the cell cycle of progenitor cells in the lateral ganglionic eminence -LRB- LGE -RRB- , the neuroepithelial precursor of the neostriatum .
12684471|The overall effects of dopamine on the cell cycle are D1-like effects , most likely because of the preponderance of D1-like binding sites in the embryonic neostriatum .
12687681|This coincidence is found in areas of the avian ventral and lateral pallium -LRB- ventral hyperstriatum , neostriatum , and ectostriatum -RRB- and in a part of the archistriatum , which is of pallial origin .
12687681|For example , in the neostriatum , a part of the ventral pallium , both the cadherin-7-positive patches and their R-cadherin-positive surroundings are born between embryonic day 5 and 7 , but the cadherin-7-positive cells are born during a shorter time period than the R-cadherin-positive cells .

12826492|The post-mortem neurochemical analysis showed that dopamine was partly depleted in the lateral -LRB- to 45 % -RRB- and in the medial neostriatum -LRB- 65 % -RRB- .

12834902|The volume of the song control nucleus HVC was largest in females that landed more often on nest boxes during playbacks of spring song compared to fall song , and the volume of the lateral portions of the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- lMAN -RRB- related positively to the extent to which females directed landings towards nest boxes playing spring rather than fall song .
12835113|In contrast , 4x 15mg/kg had a low risk of lethality and led to substantial dopamine depletions , which were more severe in the neostriatum than the ventral striatum , and more severe in C57 than in Balb mice .

12879354|In the dorsal portion of the caudomedial neostriatum , ZENK induction was correlated with the amount of non-vocal courtship behavior ; however , in the caudomedial hyperstriatum ventrale , ZENK induction was more highly correlated with the females ' own vocal behavior and thus may have been partly self-induced .
12882365|The most prominent neurochemical alterations in the forebrains of aged eNOS - / - mice were : -LRB- a -RRB- increased acetylcholine levels in the neostriatum ; -LRB- b -RRB- decreased noradrenaline concentrations in the ventral striatum ; and -LRB- c -RRB- lower serotonin levels in the frontal cortex and ventral striatum .

1329379|The review of own and literature data devoted to structural and neurochemical organization of the nucleus accumbens -LRB- Acc -RRB- as well as spatial organization of their projection fibers in comparison with nucleus caudatus -LRB- neostriatum -RRB- has been presented .
1329379|A lot of attention also was payed to the Acc and the neostriatum interaction .
1329379|The many pathways by which Acc can influence neostriatum functions and therefore the motor activity controlled by the neostriatum are discussed .
1329379|It was stressed that the influence of Acc on striatal DA-ergic system is very likely mediated via kainate/quisqualate -LRB- but not NMDA -RRB- inputs of the neostriatum .
1329379|The balance of DA-ergic mechanisms of neostriatum and Acc as important basis of animals adequate behaviour in conditioning situation was proposed .
1329801|Age-related differences in the phosphoinositide system in rat neostriatum .

1346233|Synaptic localization of kappa opioid receptors in guinea pig neostriatum .
1346233|Distribution of kappa opioid receptors was examined by EM radioautography in sections of guinea pig neostriatum with the selective 125I-labeled dynorphin analog -LSB- D-Pro10 -RSB- dynorphin - -LRB- 1-11 -RRB- .
1346233|A small proportion of labeled sites was associated with axo-axonic interfaces , which may subserve the kappa opioid-induced regulation of presynaptic dopamine and acetylcholine release documented in guinea pig neostriatum .
1346233|This proportion is markedly higher than that previously reported for either mu or delta sites in rat neostriatum .

1347270|Also in the dose range 10-100 mg/kg Modafinil counteracts the MPTP-induced depletion of DA stores both in the neostriatum and the substantia nigra .
1347270|Experiments with microdialysis in intact rats failed to demonstrate any increases of superfusate DA levels in neostriatum with 30 mg/kg of Modafinil .
1348111|The effect of phencyclidine and DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid on N-methyl-D-aspartic acid induced changes in extracellular concentration of dopamine and DOPAC in the rat neostriatum .

1349255|An electron microscopic morphometric comparison of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive innervation in the neostriatum and the nucleus accumbens core and shell .
1349255|The synaptic targets and size distributions of the sectioned profiles of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive fibers and boutons in the neostriatum and shell and core of the nucleus accumbens were evaluated .
1349255|Significantly more synaptic contacts where dendrite shafts are the postsynaptic element were observed in the shell than in the core of the nucleus accumbens or neostriatum .
1349255|Relative to the core and neostriatum , a significantly greater proportion of the tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive innervation of the accumbal shell consisted of thin fiber and small bouton profiles .
1349255|Thus , with regard to the morphometric parameters evaluated , the core of the nucleus accumbens is aligned with neostriatum and the shell is different from the core and neostriatum .
1349255|In the light of these data , it is probably that the effects of the dopaminergic innervation in the core resemble the effects in neostriatum more than do those in the shell .
1350070|We therefore measured and compared the effects of iontophoretically applied dopamine and neurotensin in the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- co-existent innervation -RRB- vs the nucleus accumbens and neostriatum -LRB- distinct innervation -RRB- of urethane-anesthetized rats .

1360310|Transplantation of embryonic mesencephalic and medullary raphe neurons to the neostriatum of rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions .
1360310|The implantation of dopamine-rich mesencephalic grafts into the 6-hydroxydopamine -LRB- 6-OHDA -RRB- - lesioned neostriatum of rats was accompanied by marked hyperinnervation by serotonin -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- fibers .
1360310|The purpose of this study was to examine the possibility that the graft-derived 5-HT hyperinnervation is governed by target-related effects present in the host neostriatum and the question of whether grafts rich in 5-HT cells can ameliorate the drug-induced motor asymmetry resulting from unilateral 6-OHDA lesions .
1360310|Immunohistochemistry showed that the R5-HT/L and C5-HT/L groups had 5-HT hyperinnervation in the neostriatum of the lesioned side .
1360310|There was no target-related effect of the 6-OHDA-lesioned neostriatum specific for the different types of 5-HT tissue .
1361249|The effects of BMY-14802 -LRB- 5 , 10 , or 20 mg/kg -RRB- , a sigma-receptor ligand showing preclinical evidence of antipsychotic efficacy , were tested on single-unit activity in the neostriatum of freely moving rats with or without pretreatment with 1.0 mg/kg D-amphetamine .
1361419|Effect of the neurotoxin AF64A on intrinsic and extrinsic neuronal systems of rat neostriatum measured by in vivo microdialysis .
1361419|Basal extracellular striatal dopamine and glutamate levels , representing the two major extrinsic neurotransmitter systems innervating the neostriatum were only affected by the highest dose of AF64A .
1361441|The latter effect was statistically significant only in the ventral , limbic , portion of the neostriatum .
1362449|The neostriatum contains a wide variety of neuroactive substances associated with several well-defined functional neuronal systems .
1364239|Tyrosine hydroxylase levels in the neostriatum , nucleus accumbens , nucleus septi lateralis and tractus diagonalis , and calmodulin levels in the medial part of the neostriatum of SHR were lower than those in WKY .
1364239|We reported previously that the decrease of the serum calcium level in SHR causes a decrease of the dopamine levels in the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens regions through a calmodulin-dependent system , and subsequent low levels of dopamine in the brain which may produce an increase in blood pressure .
1364239|Combining this finding and our previous reports , we also suggest that the lower dopamine levels seen in the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens regions of SHR may result from the decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase and/or calmodulin levels in these regions in addition to the abnormality of calcium metabolism , and low levels of dopamine may produce an increase in blood pressure through functions of cerebral dopaminergic neurons and peripheral sympathetic nerves .

1369566|Analysis of the obtained results also allowed to make a conclusion that the influence of carbocholine micro-injections into the neostriatum on differentiation depended on a number of factors : it did not take place when the signal was poorly distinguished -LRB- judging by the values of motor components to defensive and differentiation signals -RRB- or , on the other hand , against the background of stable differentiation reaction in other animals , i.e. in case of complete learning .

1511283|CaBP28K was elevated by 75 % -LRB- P less than 0.01 -RRB- in the olfactory bulb following i.c.v. rhNGF in each of two experiments and was not altered in the temporal cortex , hippocampus , olfactory tubercle , cerebellum , or neostriatum .
1511283|Direct striatal injections of rhNGF did not alter CaBP28K in the neostriatum or other regions -LRB- including the olfactory bulb -RRB- .
1511350|No changes in DA uptake in the neostriatum were found with respect to either strain , or age or sex .
15115324|These data are assessed on the basis of concepts of the existence of two efferent outputs from the neostriatum with opposite effects on their targets and the roles of muscarinic and dopamine receptors in triggering and blocking these effects .

15151184|Activation of the GABAergic system of the neostriatum had no significant effect on behavior .
15151184|Simultaneous administration of picrotoxin and GABA into the neostriatum produced less hyperkinesia ; administration of picrotoxin and bicuculline altered the nature of hyperkinesia .

1523897|While corticostriatal fibres from S1 enter dorso-lateral parts of the neostriatum fibres from M1 penetrate the dorsal part of the neostriatum more rostrally .
1523897|Most of the fibre terminals of M1 projection are located laterally overlapping the zone of distribution of S1 fibre terminals in the neostriatum .
1523897|Overlapping terminals of the corticofugal fibres of S1 and M1 in the lateral neostriatum can form a basis for interaction of somatosensory and motor impulses .
1523897|It may be suggested that the role of the neostriatum in sensory integration is associated with certain features of the corticofugal fibre terminals distribution in it at all levels of development of the central nervous system .
1527588|Although this G-protein has been functionally associated with D2/dopamine and mu-opioid receptors in striatal membranes , its localization to neurons of the neostriatum , a brain region rich in adenylyl cyclase activity , has not been established .
1527588|In the neostriatum , immunoreactivity was localized to medium-sized spiny and aspiny neurons and axon terminals that formed symmetric synapses .
1527588|Western blot analysis in purified synaptosome preparations of the neostriatum , globus pallidus , and substantia nigra with the same antiserum used in the immunohistochemistry demonstrated a predominant 41 kDa protein corresponding to the molecular mass of Gi alpha .
1528865|To test this hypothesis , we used two polyclonal antisera against synthetic peptides corresponding to nonoverlapping sequences within RC3 and compared cellular distributions of their binding in neostriatum of adult rats by immunohistochemistry , Golgi impregnation/gold toning , and correlative light/electron microscopy .
15305873|Biochemical assessments revealed that the HDC-knockout mice had higher acetylcholine concentrations and a significantly higher 5-HT turnover in the frontal cortex , but reduced acetylcholine levels in the neostriatum .
15305875|In the present study we compared the structure of neurons in the hippocampus and neostriatum in chicks reared with or without visual barriers .
15305875|By contrast , no evidence was found that rearing treatment differentially influences dendrite length or SLD in the neostriatum , suggesting that the above environment-induced changes may be specific to the hippocampus .

15351631|mijovic@mit.edu Although the role of frontoparietal cortex in spatial egocentric processing is well established , recent animal-lesion and human functional imaging studies have suggested that the neostriatum may also be a critical modulator in the processing of body-centred spatial orientation .
15356181|This work investigated if diverse properties could be ascribed to evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents -LRB- IPSCs -RRB- recorded on rat neostriatal neurons when field stimulation was delivered at two different locations : the globus pallidus -LRB- GP -RRB- and the neostriatum -LRB- NS -RRB- .
15356204|Comparison of IPSCs evoked by spiny and fast-spiking neurons in the neostriatum .
15356204|Most neurons in the neostriatum are GABAergic spiny projection neurons with extensive local axon collaterals innervating principally other spiny projection neurons .
15356204|These results argue against models of competitive inhibition in neostriatum , including those in which competitive inhibition is transiently effective during development and learning , and suggest a different role for the spiny cell axon collaterals .
15368533|Finally , comparison of corticopontine and corticostriatal projections in the same experimental animals reveals that SI-SII overlap is significantly larger in the pontine nuclei than in the neostriatum .

15464222|Developmental changes of transient potassium currents in large aspiny neurons in the neostriatum .
15464222|The rapidly inactivating A-type current is a major component of the voltage-dependent outward potassium currents in the large aspiny -LRB- LA -RRB- neurons in the neostriatum .
15464222|The large aspiny neurons play important roles in the function of neostriatum in physiological and pathological conditions .
15464222|These results suggest that the decrease of rapidly inactivating A-type potassium current during development might contribute , at least in part , to the maturation of the membrane excitability of large aspiny neurons in the neostriatum .
15464402|Subsequent work shifted thinking beyond dichotomies to a view , grounded in biology , that memory is composed of multiple separate systems supported , for example , by the hippocampus and related structures , the amygdala , the neostriatum , and the cerebellum .
15474166|GABAergic microcircuits in the neostriatum .
15474166|An important feature of the functional organization of the neostriatum has long been assumed to be the existence of a widespread lateral inhibitory network mediated by the axon collaterals of spiny projection neurons .
15474166|These new data are incompatible with current `` winner-take-all '' models of lateral inhibitory function in the neostriatum , and they force a modification of established concepts of the functional roles of feedback inhibition in this nucleus .
15501605|The principal GABAergic inputs to the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra originate from neurons of the neostriatum , globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars reticulata .
15501605|We used this technique to explore the relation between the firing pattern of dopaminergic neurons and extracellular dopamine levels in the neostriatum in vivo .
15501605|Specifically , we tested whether an increase in burst firing in dopaminergic neurons produced by increased pallidal activity led to increased extracellular dopamine levels in the neostriatum .
15501605|These data suggest that afferent-induced burst firing in dopaminergic neurons leads to an increase in extracellular dopamine levels in the neostriatum when compared with less bursty patterns with similar overall firing rates .

1560247|In other experiments , designed to replicate and expand on the results of Turski et al. -LRB- 1991 -RRB- , the extended treatment of rats with MK-801 did not prevent MPP -LRB- + -RRB- - induced cell loss in the infused substantia nigra pars compacta or the dopamine depletion in the ipsilateral neostriatum at 7-11 days after MPP + infusion .
15606895|Recent studies in this field suggest that microdialysis ZNF method seriously underestimates the resting concentration of extracellular dopamine in the rat neostriatum because probe implantation preferentially damages nearby dopamine release sites and that dopamine uptake inhibition increases the relative recovery of dopamine by microdialysis .

15610164|Vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 -LRB- VGluT1 and VGluT2 -RRB- are located on axon terminals of corticostriatal and thalamostriatal afferents , respectively , whereas VGluT3 is found in axon terminals of cholinergic interneurons in the neostriatum .

15610164|Immunoreactive gold particles for AMPA receptor subunits GluR1 and GluR2/3 were frequently found not only on postsynaptic but also on presynaptic profiles immunopositive for VGluT1 and VGluT2 in the neostriatum , and GluR4-immunoreactive particles were observed on postsynaptic and presynaptic profiles positive for VGluT1 .
15610164|Quantitative analysis revealed that 27-45 % of GluR1 - , GluR2 - , GluR2/3 - and GluR4-immunopositive particles found in VGluT1 - or VGluT2-positive synaptic structures in the neostriatum were associated with the presynaptic profiles of VGluT-positive axons .
15610164|In contrast , VGluT-positive presynaptic profiles in the neostriatum showed almost no immunoreactivity for NMDA receptor subunits NR1 or NR2A/B .
15610164|Furthermore , almost no GluR2/3-immunopositive particles were observed in presynaptic profiles of VGluT3-positive -LRB- cholinergic -RRB- terminals that made asymmetric synapses in the neostriatum , or in those of VGluT1 - or VGluT2-positive terminals in the neocortex .
1561322|The present experiments were carried out to determine the effects of energy deposition from energetic iron -LRB- 56Fe particles , an important component of cosmic rays -RRB- on motor behavioral performance and to determine if the observed deficits were caused by alterations in the neostriatum -LRB- an important motor control area -RRB- .
156535|The motor responses of rats with kainic acid lesions of the neostriatum to a sedative dose of apomorphine -LRB- 50 micrograms/kg -RRB- was similar to that observed in intact controls .

1578900|The properties of Neurobiotin as a tracer were further examined in this study by making pressure injections into different regions of the cerebral cortex or the rostral neostriatum of rats or by incubating striatal cells in culture with the tracer .
1578900|Results showed extensive anterograde transport of Neurobiotin in cortical axons and terminals within the neostriatum 2-70 h after single or multiple cortical injections of the tracer .
1578900|Similarly , profuse axonal projections to the medial portion of the globus pallidus were seen after an injection of Neurobiotin into the rostral neostriatum .
15800374|To resolve this issue , we analyzed by immunogold histochemistry the subcellular distribution of -LRB- delta -RRB- ORs in the nucleus accumbens , dorsal neostriatum , and frontal cortex in mice treated or not with morphine -LRB- 48 h -RRB- .
15800374|We observed that prolonged treatment with morphine induced a translocation of -LRB- delta -RRB- ORs from intracellular to subplasmalemmal and membrane compartments in dendrites from both the nucleus accumbens and the dorsal neostriatum but not from the frontal cortex .
15804725|The optical disector detected decreases in the estimated total number of dopamine cells in the entire ipsilateral pars compacta of the substantia nigra -LRB- SNc -RRB- and the ventral tegmental area -LRB- VTA -RRB- as well as in the estimated total number of varicosity profiles in the entire ipsilateral neostriatum .
15804725|Increases in the estimated total number of GFAP positive astrocytes were found in the entire neostriatum bilaterally as well as in the ipsilateral entire SNc and VTA of 6-OHDA lesioned rats .
15804725|The estimated total number of OX-42 immunoreactive microglial profiles was elevated only in the ipsilateral entire neostriatum of the lesioned rats .
15804725|The rotator detected cytoplasmic hypertrophy in the astrocytes , and also a shift to the fight of the gaussian curves of the normal distribution of the logarithmic plotted values of the astroglial cell body volumes of the neostriatum bilaterally as well as in the ipsilateral SNc and VTA of the striatal 6-OHDA injected rats .
15804725|Cytoplasmic hypertrophy of microglia , and also a shift to the right of the gaussian curves of the values of microglia cell body volumes were seen only in the ipsilateral neostriatum ; however , the point intercepts revealed an increased amount of microglial processes in the ipsilateral SNc and VTA of the lesioned rats .

1584428|Two to six months after implantation of fetal striatal primordia into the kainic acid-lesioned neostriatum of adult rats , spiny neurons in the grafts were stained intracellularly with biocytin .
1584428|To determine whether the spiny neurons in the grafts differentiate morphologically as in the host neostriatum , the intracellularly stained spiny neurons in the grafts were studied with light and electron microscopy and compared with that of spiny neurons in the host neostriatum .
1584428|All these features resembled the appearance of spiny neurons in the intact neostriatum .
1584428|However , quantitative studies showed that the somata of spiny neurons in the grafts were larger than those in the host neostriatum -LRB- projected cross-sectional areas of 230 + / - 64.6 microns 2 in the grafts and 158 + / - 28.9 microns 2 in the host -RRB- and the spine density of graft neurons was lower than that of host neurons .
1584428|Cells near the border of the grafts had dendrites extending both into the graft and into the host neostriatum .
1584428|Unlike spiny neurons in the normal adult neostriatum , the spiny cells of the graft could have nuclear indentations .

15901483|The hyperkinetic phenomenology has commonly been attributed to a disturbance of the basal ganglia function , mainly the neostriatum , but its pathophysiology mechanisms remain unclear .

15912501|Functional circuits mediating sensorimotor integration : quantitative comparisons of projections from rodent barrel cortex to primary motor cortex , neostriatum , superior colliculus , and the pons .
15912501|Therefore , in each animal , we injected two anterograde tracers into SI barrel cortex and compared the relative density and spatial extent of the labeled projections to the primary motor -LRB- MI -RRB- cortex , neostriatum , superior colliculus , and basal pons .
15912501|Quantitative analysis revealed that these projections terminated most extensively in the neostriatum , to a lesser extent in MI cortex , and innervated the least amount of neuropil in the superior colliculus and pontine nuclei .
15912501|As a proportion of total labeling , densely packed clusters of labeled terminals were most prevalent in the pons , less prevalent in neostriatum and superior colliculus , and least prevalent in MI cortex .
15935517|However , despite a strong association between the prefrontal cortex and the neostriatum , the role of the neostriatum in cognitive aging is less certain .
1594634|The analysis of biogenic amines in tissue samples showed that amphetamine decreased 3,4-dihydroxy-phenylacetic acid -LRB- DOPAC -RRB- levels and DOPAC/dopamine ratios in the neostriatum , and resulted in a lower 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid -LRB- 5-HIAA -RRB- / 5-hydroxytryptamine -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- ratio in the ventral mesencephalon .
1594634|Apomorphine decreased the dopamine metabolites -LSB- DOPAC , homovanillic acid -LRB- HVA -RRB- , 3-methoxy-tyramine -LRB- 3-MT -RRB- -RSB- and their respective metabolite/transmitter ratios and increased dopamine levels in the neostriatum .
1594634|In addition to its effects on dopamine , apomorphine decreased norepinephrine in the ventral neostriatum and 5-HT and 5-HIAA in the cortex .

16380827|It is concluded that the indirect efferent output of the neostriatum has an important role in the process of learning the motor operant reflex involving maintenance of a defined degree of flexion -LRB- where the main role is played by the tonic component of the movement -RRB- and during the process of automation of the motor skill .

1641126|In comparison to sham microinjected rats , a single intrastriatal microinjection of pertussis toxin -LRB- 1 microgram -RRB- resulted in a significant increase in the amount of both proneurotensin and preproenkephalin A mRNAs in the ipsilateral neostriatum .

1655975|In conclusion , our results suggest that , during the aging process , the cholinergic impairment is related to a decrease in NGF levels in neostriatum but not in cortex and hippocampus .

1660986|Limbic projection from the amygdala to the basal forebrain and the neostriatum was studied physiologically during development of amygdaloid kindling in cats .
1660986|These findings suggest that LTP in amygdalo-striatal synaptic transmission following tetanic stimulation represents an example of plastic changes in a neuronal chain within the neostriatum , which would underlie the pathophysiological mechanism for developing motor seizures of amygdaloid kindling .

1662138|Based on the present findings it is possible that an increased D1 transmission in neostriatum immediately following the ischemic injury may contribute to striatal nerve cell degeneration in which an enhancement of NMDA receptor transduction may be implicated .

1680521|The degree of serotonergic fiber growth into the neostriatum of rats subjected to unilateral 6-OHDA lesions followed by fetal ventral mesencephalic grafts was examined immunohistochemically .
1680521|However , there was significant serotonergic hyperinnervation throughout the transplanted neostriatum compared with the control side .
1680521|The hyperinnervation derived from the grafted neurons was most marked in the dorsal and lateral sectors of the rostral neostriatum .

1681088|In normal rats , FCE 23884 accelerated markedly dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- turnover in the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens as indicated by the increased ratios of dihydroxphenyl acetic acid/DA and homovanillic acid/DA .
1681088|In contrast with these antidopaminergic properties , FCE 23884 consistently stimulated basal adenylate cyclase activity in vitro -LRB- ED50 = 0.6 microM -RRB- and elicited a rapid increase of cyclic AMP formation in the neostriatum of normal -LRB- 35 % -RRB- and reserpinized -LRB- 82 % -RRB- rats in vivo .

1683475|The synaptic specializations of these enkephalin-immunoreactive boutons were significantly longer in the neostriatum from the injected side .
1683475|The increase in enkephalin immunoreactivity observed in the dopamine-depleted neostriatum in previous studies may be explained by the increase in the size of enkephalin-immunoreactive synaptic boutons found in the present ultrastructural investigation .
1683539|In particular it has been shown that d-amphetamine can induce an activation of the c-fos early gene in various subregions of the neostriatum and that morphine treatment can antagonize this activation .

1933411|The data suggest that the neostriatum , but not the nucleus accumbens , is primarily involved in the apomorphine-induced changes in hindlimb stepping , and that the nucleus accumbens , but not the neostriatum , is primarily involved in the dexamphetamine-induced changes in forelimb stepping .
19350384|It is necessary to explain these events because the neostriatum is a recurrent network of inhibitory neurons .
19378803|In addition to the 2 segregated striatofugal groups , the neostriatum possesses a mosaic organization composed of patch and matrix compartments .
1941081|The m4-receptor was enriched in neostriatum , olfactory tubercle , and islands of Calleja , indicating an important role in extrapyramidal function .
1943438|Acute and long-term amphetamine treatments alter extracellular ascorbate in neostriatum but not nucleus accumbens of freely moving rats .
1943438|The ability of amphetamine to alter the extracellular level of ascorbate , an apparent modulator of neostriatal function , was assessed voltammetrically in the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens of awake , behaving rats .
1943438|The results of these experiments confirm a site-specific action of amphetamine on ascorbate release and suggest complex changes in the extracellular level of this substance in the neostriatum with long-term treatment .
19450655|Using microdialysis , we investigated the effect of l-proline on monoamine release in the medio-rostral neostriatum/hyperstriatum ventrale -LRB- MNH -RRB- of freely moving and restricted chicks .
194632|Current evidence , for example , suggests that amphetamine produces an inhibition of neuronal activity in the neostriatum and pars compacta of the substantia nigra by means of dopamine released from dopaminergic terminals in the neostriatum and dopaminergic dendrites in the substantia nigra respectively .
194632|In addition , current evidence suggests the possibility of a GABA-mediated functional antagonism between excitatory cortical and/or thalamic input to the neostriatum and dopaminergic input from the substantia nigra which could be involved in the apparently mutually exclusive occurrence of amphetamine-induced locomotion and stereotyped behaviors that follow amphetamine administration .
19467297|In addition , c-Fos expression in the ventrolateral neostriatum , which is the striatal area most associated with tremulous jaw movements , was used as a marker of striatal cell activity in animals that were tested in the behavioral experiments .
19478136|Lasting reduction of cocaine action in neostriatum -- a hydrolase gene therapy approach .
19478136|Immunohistochemistry of the neostriatum on day 7 showed many FosB-reactive nuclei in unprotected rats but few if any in rats pretreated with active vector , which resembled rats never exposed to cocaine .
19479997|Bilateral projections from rat MI whisker cortex to the neostriatum , thalamus , and claustrum : forebrain circuits for modulating whisking behavior .
19479997|Both MI regions project bilaterally to the neostriatum , but the corticostriatal projections from the whisker region are denser and more evenly distributed across both hemispheres than those from the MI forepaw region .
19479997|Bilateral deposits of different tracers in MI revealed overlapping projections to the neostriatum , thalamus , and claustrum when the whisker regions were injected , but not when the forepaw regions were injected .
19479997|These results suggest that the bilateral coordination of the whiskers depends , in part , on MI projections to the contralateral neostriatum , thalamus , and claustrum .
19523495|Patients with Tourette syndrome exhibited increases of DAT binding in the neostriatum -LRB- 5 out of 10 reports -RRB- increases of dopamine storage and dopamine release in the ventral striatum -LRB- 1 report , each -RRB- .
19523495|These findings , tentatively , may be interpreted in terms of an increased availability of synaptic dopamine in the neostriatum , which is compensated for both pre - and postsynaptically by increasing dopamine reuptake into the presynaptic terminal , and decreasing -LRB- inhibitory -RRB- signal transduction of efferent fibers .
1953541|While functional improvement in animal models of Parkinson 's disease has been reported following neural grafting , the treatment of human Parkinsonian patients by adrenal medulla autografting into the neostriatum has produced little clinical improvement overall , and is associated with significant morbidity .
19555686|Protein ubiquitination in postsynaptic densities after hypoxia in rat neostriatum is blocked by hypothermia .
19555686|The results presented here demonstrate that PSDs of the rat neostriatum are highly modified and ubiquitinated 6 months after induction of hypoxia in a model of perinatal asphyxia .
1956580|In mice -LRB- C57BL/6 -RRB- , stereotaxic injection of MPTP N-oxide -LRB- 15 micrograms -RRB- into the neostriatum produced dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- depletion similar to that caused by MPTP .
19570323|Systemic transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells can reduce cognitive and motor deficits in rats with unilateral lesions of the neostriatum .
19588470|In the mouse neostriatum GABA transporter 1 -LRB- GAT-1 -RRB- was previously found to assist in the clearance of GABA from the extracellular space and influence both phasic and tonic GABAergic inhibition of medium-sized striatal output neurons -LRB- SONs -RRB- .
19588470|In this study , we aimed at assessing the role of GAT-3 in the mouse neostriatum .
19588470|We conclude that GAT-3 is functionally expressed in the mouse neostriatum .
19604884|Labeling of cell bodies in pars compacta of substantia nigra -LRB- SNc -RRB- following injections of horseradish peroxidase -LRB- HRP -RRB- in the neostriatum was not affected by repeated systemic injections of apomorphine or haloperidol during the survival time .

1968850|Dissociated cell suspensions were prepared from the ventral midbrain of normal mouse foetuses and stereotaxically implanted into the neostriatum of 2-3 months old homozygous weaver mutant mice , which are severely deficient in dopamine .
1968959|Comparison of transmitter amino acid levels in rat globus pallidus and neostriatum during hypoglycemia or after treatment with methionine sulfoximine or gamma-vinyl gamma-aminobutyric acid .
1968959|The levels of amino acids in globus pallidus , a structure heavily innervated with gamma-aminobutyric acid -LRB- GABA -RRB- - ergic terminals but few glutamergic terminals , were compared with the levels in neostriatum , a structure richly innervated with glutamergic terminals but intermediate in GABAergic terminals .
1968959|The level of glutamate in neostriatum was twice as high as in globus pallidus whereas the level of GABA in globus pallidus was three times higher than in neostriatum .
1968959|This reduction was accompanied by the largest decrease in the level of glutamate in neostriatum , indicating that transmitter glutamate turns over more rapidly than other glutamate pools .
1968959|Likewise , insulin decreased the levels of glutamate and glutamine more in neostriatum than in globus pallidus .
1968959|gamma-Vinyl GABA increased the level of GABA in globus pallidus more than in neostriatum although the percent increase was largest in neostriatum .

1972268|This study utilized the technique of in situ hybridization histochemistry to identify cells expressing neurotransmitter mRNAs in embryonic striatal tissue grafts implanted into the ibotenic acid-lesioned rat neostriatum .
1972268|Synthetic 32P - or 35S-labelled oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes specific for prosomatostatin , proneuropeptide Y. proenkephalin , prodynorphin and preprotachykinin mRNAs and a 32P-labelled cRNA probe specific for glutamate decarboxylase mRNA were used to study the regional and cellular changes in these mRNA levels in the normal , lesioned and grafted neostriatum .
1972342|The role of neocortical afferent fibers in determining the EAA sensitivity of neostriatal neurons was assessed by comparing EAA toxicity in co-cultures of neocortex and neostriatum with that of neostriatum alone .
1972342|In cultures of neostriatum alone , EAAs produced only modest neuronal losses .
1974856|The studies reported here show that the content of cyclic guanosine monophosphate -LRB- cGMP -RRB- in the mouse neostriatum is modulated by dopaminergic drugs in a manner which also discriminates D1 and D2 receptors .
1975218|Histological and ultrastructural evidence that D-amphetamine causes degeneration in neostriatum and frontal cortex of rats .
1975218|Using Fink-Heimer silver staining , axonal degeneration was detected in the neostriatum and the dorsal agranular insular cortex and degenerating pyramidal cells were observed in portions of the somatosensory neocortex in both strains .
1975218|In contrast , the damage in neostriatum probably includes damage to dopamine axonal terminals since tyrosine hydroxylase immunolabeling was patchy with many swollen and distorted labeled axons .
1975218|Electron microscopy confirmed that the neostriatum contained many tyrosine hydroxylase-labeled axons that were swollen and disrupted , although other labeled processes made normal symmetric synapses onto spines and dendrites .
1975218|Some of these appeared to be astrocytic processes and a few were myelinated axons , suggesting that some non-monoamine , possibly cortical afferents , are also degenerating in the neostriatum .

1981853|Nigrostriatal dopamine mediates the stimulatory effects of corticotropin releasing factor on methionine-enkephalin and dynorphin release from the rat neostriatum .
1981853|However , the results of this study demonstrate that the action of CRF on Met-enkephalin as well as dynorphin release from the rat neostriatum is DA dependent .
1981853|The data suggest that CRF receptors in the rat neostriatum may be localized on nigrostriatal/nigropallidal DA terminals/collaterals .
1982267|Stimulation of both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors increases behavioral activation and ascorbate release in the neostriatum of freely moving rats .

19942704|mandelli@istituto-besta.it BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : The neostriatum is known to be affected in HD .
19942704|In this work , our aim was to determine whether microstructural and volumetric alterations occur in the neostriatum of presymptomatic HD gene carriers and in patients with early-stage HD .
19942704|CONCLUSIONS : Altered diffusivity and reduced volume of the caudate nucleus in presymptomatic HD gene carriers indicate that the neostriatum is affected well before the onset of symptoms .
19967069|We investigated the effect of ampicillin on neuronal damage in the mouse hippocampus and neostriatum following transient global forebrain ischemia .
19967069|Pre - and post-ischemic treatment with ampicillin -LRB- 50 mg/kg/day or 200 mg/kg/day -RRB- prevented ischemic neuronal death in the medial CA1 area of the hippocampus as well as the neostriatum in a dose-dependent manner .
20020215|kbsh@infran.ru The present study was based on the concept -LRB- Shapovalova , 2000 -RRB- that activation and blockade of different types of muscarinic and dopamine receptors located in different efferent outputs of the neostriatum should have different effects on motor behavior .
20020215|Bilateral microinjections of the same D -LRB- 1 -RRB- receptor blocker into the neostriatum at doses of 0.1 and 1.0 microg did not alter the proportion of correct solutions of the operant task , though the microinjections did induce a series of changes in motor activity , with significant increases in the latent period of the response , and in some cases increases in response amplitude , decreased phasicity , and complete cessation of intersignal raisings of the limb .
20020215|These data lead to the following conclusions : 1 -RRB- the difference in the effects of systemic and intrastriatal administration of SCH23390 evidently results from the fact that systemic administration can also block D -LRB- 1 -RRB- receptors in other structures in addition to the neostriatum ; 2 -RRB- the effects of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system on the neostriatum mediated by D -LRB- 1 -RRB- receptors are complex , with activation of motor activity -LRB- projection spiny neurons in the direct pathway -RRB- and weak modulation of mental processes -LRB- large aspiny cholinergic interneurons -RRB- ; 3 -RRB- regulation of movement and postural rearrangement is mediated by different efferent outputs of the neostriatum .
2002218|In light of this fact and because children with ADHD not only appear to demonstrate these symptoms but also neglect the left side and have decreased activation of their right neostriatum , we propose that these children have a right hemisphere dysfunction .
20034560|The data do not indicate a neuroprotective action of indirubins in mice treated with MPTP but that they do suggest that they may be neuroprotective against KA-induced injury of the neostriatum .
2005239|In the host neostriatum , labeled fibers from the parafascicular nucleus -LRB- PF -RRB- arborized in a large region in the neostriatum , but avoided small patchlike areas .
2005239|Labeled fibers from the centromedial and paracentral nuclei -LRB- CeM-PC -RRB- projected to a similarly large area within the neostriatum but did not show any nonuniformity .
2005239|Compared to the host neostriatum , the distribution of postsynaptic elements in the grafts was altered dramatically .
2005239|In the host neostriatum , 89 % of the terminals from PF terminated onto dendritic shafts ; 93 % of the CeM-PC terminals contacted dendritic spines .
20095087|6-hydroxydopamine lesions in the rat neostriatum impair sequential learning in a serial reaction time task .
20095087|The neurotoxic lesions , which was placed before the start of training , led to the expected sub-total dopamine depletions -LRB- i.e. residual levels around 34-56 % of controls -RRB- , especially in the medial neostriatum .
2010748|The volumes of brain regions and sizes of neurons were measured in four song nuclei : HVc , robust nucleus of the archistriatum -LRB- RA -RRB- , lateral magnocellular nucleus of the neostriatum -LRB- IMAN -RRB- , and Area X. Lesions of HVc blocked the masculinizing effects of estradiol on RA and Area X on the side of the lesion .
2013650|The topographic organization of neostriatal connections was investigated by axonal transport of horseradish peroxidase , tritiated amino acids , or mixtures of both injected into the neostriatum of macaque monkeys .
20156566|Shape analysis of the neostriatum in frontotemporal lobar degeneration , Alzheimer 's disease , and controls .
20156566|We measured the neostriatum -LRB- caudate nucleus and putamen -RRB- volume in FTLD -LRB- n = 34 -RRB- , in comparison with controls -LRB- n = 27 -RRB- and Alzheimer 's disease -LRB- AD , n = 19 -RRB- subjects .
2016641|Diffusion characteristics and extracellular volume fraction during normoxia and hypoxia in slices of rat neostriatum .
2016641|Diffusion properties of submerged , superfused slices from the rat neostriatum were measured by quantitative analysis of concentration-time profiles of tetramethylammonium -LRB- TMA + -RRB- introduced by iontophoresis .
20184951|ADXA had no effect on MA-induced long-term 5-HT reductions in the neostriatum or entorhinal cortex or on 5-HIAA reductions in the hippocampus .
2029626|High - and low-voltage activated calcium currents are expressed by neurons cultured from embryonic rat neostriatum .
20305408|It is mainly located in the neostriatum as well as in the globus pallidus , substantia nigra , cerebral cortex , thalamus , etc. .
2033514|There were no significant differences in the Km values for MAO-B in the neostriatum among the strains of mice examined .
20352688|It was demonstrated in chronic experiments in Wistar rats that only the first of daily multiple microinjections of glutamate metabotropic 5-th type receptor antagonist MTEP into the rostral region of neostriatum impaired the avoidance conditioning in a shuttle box .
20352688|Within the next two weeks , MTEP was ineffective but being injected into the neostriatum simultaneously with picrotoxin prevented the impairment of avoidance conditioning in a shuttle-box and decreased the hyperactivity -LRB- open-field locomotor hyperactivity and choreic hyperkinesis -RRB- produced by this GABA-A receptor antagonist .
20358768|Comparative topographical analysis of definitive and early CR+PS cells demonstrated that in 7-day-old mice CR+PS cells were absent from the areas of their localization in adult animals - anterior olfactory nucleus , cortical plate and inner portion of neostriatum .
20358768|Meanwhile , some CR+PS - like cells were detected in 7-day-old mice inside the rostral migratory route , close to neostriatum anterior boundary , along the dorsal border between neostriatum and corpus callosum , subependymal layer of lateral wall of the lateral ventricle , and in the cingulum area .
20371375|The lesions led to subtotal dopaminergic depletions in the ventral striatum -LRB- 58-60 % -RRB- and also minor depletions in the medial neostriatum -LRB- 32-46 % -RRB- .
20371375|Therefore , we assume that subtotal dopamine loss in the medial neostriatum , rather than the ventral striatum , has a substantial effect on sequential learning .
2039940|Large neurons in the neostriatum in Alzheimer 's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy : a topographic , histologic and ultrastructural investigation .
2039940|Large neurons in the neostriatum of patients with Alzheimer 's disease -LRB- AD -RRB- and progressive supranuclear palsy -LRB- PSP -RRB- were investigated topographically , histologically and ultrastructurally .
2039940|The number of large neurons whose nuclear area is greater than 101 microns2 was uniformly decreased in the neostriatum in PSP , but the decrease of these neurons in AD appeared to be more marked in the nucleus accumbens .
20411769|Most of the afferents to substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons comprise monosynaptic inputs from GABAergic projection neurons in the ipsilateral neostriatum , the globus pallidus , and the substantia nigra pars reticulata .
20411778|In the neostriatum , OX42 immunoreactive -LRB- ir -RRB- microglial profiles increased at 24 h , peaked at 72 h , was still increased at 7 days but not 14 days after the 6-OHDA injection .
20487863|Characteristics of angiotensin II binding sites in the neostriatum of the rat brain .
20487863|These findings support the idea that functional angiotensin II receptors exist on membranes of intrinsic neurones in the rat neostriatum as previously indicated by microiontophoretic application experiments .
20488902|RESULTS : Compared with controls , in addition to neostriatum and cortical GM volume loss , individuals with HD showed volume loss in the genu of the internal capsule and subcortical frontal WM bilaterally , the right splenium of the corpus callosum , and the left corona radiata .
20501123|By means of intracerebral microdialysis effects of cholecystokinin peptides and neurotensin administered via the microdialysis probe have been studied on dopamine release and metabolism in the nucleus accumbens and neostriatum of the halothane anaesthetized male rat .
20504568|The effects of adrenalectomy were investigated on the binding properties of -LSB- -LRB- 3 -RRB- H -RSB- N - propylnorapomorphine -LRB- -LSB- -LRB- 3 -RRB- H -RSB- NPA -RRB- binding sites in membrane preparations from the rat neostriatum .
20504578|- opioid receptors are highly concentrated in the more recently developed areas of the brain -LRB- cortex , neostriatum -RRB- , where they could be involved in modulation of integrational processes mainly through regulation of aminergic -LRB- especially dopamine -RRB- pathways .
20504710|On days 1 and 2 after the lesion , increased accumulation of ornithine decarboxylase mRNA was observed on the lesioned side in various telencephalic regions -LRB- e.g. neostriatum and frontoparietal cortex -RRB- , and in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra .
2052146|Type I cells which were intracellularly labeled were found outside the grafts and displayed the characteristic morphology of the medium spiny neuron of the neostriatum .
2052148|These findings suggest that experimentally induced Parkinsonism results from molecular events initiated in the neostriatum and selectively elaborated in the nigrostriatal pathway , ultimately resulting in the death of substantia nigra pars compacta dopamine neurons .
2053443|PEC-60 , a novel porcine 60-residue intestinal peptide , reduces dopamine utilization in discrete parts of the neostriatum of the male rat following an intracerebroventricular injection .
2054626|Haloperidol rapidly increases the number of neurotensin mRNA-expressing neurons in neostriatum of the rat brain .
2057125|Spiny and aspiny types of neuropeptide Y immunoreactive neurons in the monkey neostriatum .
2057125|The present study demonstrates the existence of two types of neurons with neuropeptide Y -LRB- NPY -RRB- immunoreactivity in the neostriatum of the monkey -LRB- Macacus fuscatus -RRB- by using the avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase method .
2057125|These findings suggest that there are at least two functional subpopulations of NPY neurons in the monkey neostriatum .
20575057|Immunostaining was prominent in the hippocampus , cerebral cortex , and neostriatum .
20614802|On a total of 504 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder -LRB- OCD -RRB- , generalized anxiety disorder -LRB- GAD -RRB- , panic disorder -LRB- PD -RRB- , phobia , or posttraumatic stress-disorder -LRB- PTSD -RRB- and 593 controls , investigations of VMAT2 , DAT , SERT , D1 , D2 , 5-HTIA , 5-HT2A , GABA -LRB- A -RRB- , and NK1 receptor binding in neostriatum , ventral striatum , thalamus , neocortex , limbic system , cingulate , midbrain / pons or cerebellum were performed using either PET or SPECT .
2066775|Two nuclei -LSB- hyperstriatum ventrale pars caudalis -LRB- HVc -RRB- and lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- IMAN -RRB- -RSB- that send projections to RA were lesioned at each of three different ages : 25 d after hatching , 53 d , and adulthood .
20698032|Both SHAM-MA - and ADX-MA-treated animals showed increased neostriatal glial fibrillary acidic protein and decreased monoamines in the neostriatum , hippocampus , and entorhinal cortex .
2069901|Lesions in the neostriatum did not cause deficits in any discrimination task .
2070254|The enlargement of the ventral hyperstriata + neostriata in passeriforms is fundamentally similar to that of the isocortex in mammals : it reflects an expansion of multimodal integrational capacities , as the ventral hyperstriatum and neostriatum are occupied exclusively or primarily by multimodal integrational areas as is the isocortex .
20720534|Group differences in blood-oxygen-level-dependent responses to cues and outcomes were assessed through voxel-wise whole-brain analyses and regions-of-interest analyses in the neostriatum and prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- .
20721693|Comparative topographic analysis of definitive and early CR -LRB- + -RRB- PS cells showed that in seven-day-old mice , CR -LRB- + -RRB- PS cells were absent from the sites at which they were seen in adults , i.e. , the anterior olfactory cortex , the cortical plate , and the inner part of the neostriatum .
20721693|In addition , small numbers of CR -LRB- + -RRB- PS-like cells were seen at this age within the dorsal migration pathway , at the anterior margin of the neostriatum , along the dorsal border of the neostriatum with the corpus callosum , in the subependymal layer of the lateral wall of the lateral ventricle , and in the cingulum area .
2073677|The distribution of cytosolic malic isoenzyme in the neostriatum was investigated with the peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunocytochemical method , utilizing an antiserum obtained from the rabbit .
2073677|These observations suggest that in the rat neostriatum there are some neurons especially able to catabolize pyruvate via cytosolic malic isoenzyme .
2073950|The areas studied , i.e. the hippocampal formation , neocortex , neostriatum and reticular thalamic nucleus -LRB- RTN -RRB- , show a characteristic pattern of CaBP and PV distribution , and are involved in ischemic damage to different degrees .
2073950|In the neostriatum , ischemic damage involves both CaBP-positive and negative medium spiny neurons , although the degeneration always starts in the dorsolateral neostriatum containing relatively few CaBP-positive cells .
2077100|However , systemic T did increase the mean sizes of labelled cells and of all cells sampled in MAN -LRB- magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -RRB- .

2144458|When injected into the dorsolateral neostriatum , or the amygdala , -LRB- - -RRB- sulpiride produced a suppression of conditioned avoidance behavior at the 90-min time interval only .

2150772|At all three survival times , dopamine content was reduced by more than 90 % of control values in both the rostral and caudal neostriatum ; in cerebral cortex , the dopamine depletion was less profound -LRB- 80 % -RRB- and noticeable only after 1 and 3 months .
2150772|In the rostral but not the caudal neostriatum , serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations were markedly increased at 1 and 3 months ; cortical serotonin also was augmented at 3 months .

2150772|Such an up-regulation of D2 receptors , restricted to the rostral neostriatum which was also the site of a serotonin hyperinnervation , was probably indicative of a serotonin control on the expression of D2 receptors after dopamine denervation .

21631922|The marginal division -LRB- MrD -RRB- of the neostriatum , which located at the caudomedial border of the neostriatum , was found to stain for enkephalin and substance P immunoreactivities and this region was found to be involved in learning and memory in our previous study .
21631922|METHODS : In this study , we used western blot analysis and immunoperoxidase histochemical methods with glucose oxidase-DAB-nickel staining to investigate the expression of MOR in the MrD by comparison to the patches in the neostriatum .
21631922|Immunohistochemical results showed that punctate MOR-immunoreacted fibers were observed in the `` patch '' areas in the rostrodorsal part of the neostriatum but these previous studies showed neither labelled neuronal cell bodies , nor were they shown in the caudal part of the neostriatum .

2247221|The present study was carried out in animals 18-19 months after MPP + infusion to determine firstly , if the lesion was indeed permanent and secondly , if embryonic nigral dopamine suspension grafts implanted into the dopamine-denervated neostriatum can reverse the neurochemical and behavioural deficits induced by MPP + .
2252322|A degeneration of the serotonergic system , noted as a decreased innervation and the appearance of enlarged or swollen varicosities , was observed particularly in the frontoparietal cortex , and the neostriatum of the aged rat brain .
2252365|CPP locally injected into the subthalamic nucleus , entopeduncular nucleus -- the rat homologue of the internal pallidal segment -- or substantia nigra pars reticulata of monoamine-depleted rats stimulates locomotor activity and alleviates rigidity , whereas local microinjection of CPP into the neostriatum is ineffective .
2252365|These results make it unlikely that the neostriatum is the site of the antiparkinsonian action of NMDA antagonists in monoamine-depleted rats , whereas the subthalamic nucleus , internal pallidal segment , and substantia nigra pars reticulata appear to be important for the effects of NMDA antagonists .
22535292|We discuss the role of a strategic structure in these circuits , the neostriatum .
22535292|CONCLUSION : The unique structure and linkages of the neostriatum make it an ideal structure for in vivo neuroimaging to understand the neuroanatomical basis of FTD .
2255400|Analysis of autoradiograms revealed areas of heavy cholecystokinin binding in the neostriatum and substantia nigra that were set off , often quite sharply , from the adjacent globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus where labeling was , by contrast , very light .
2255400|The pattern of cholecystokinin binding within the neostriatum was mottled ; patches of reduced label stood out from the background of more prominent binding .
2255400|The present study shows that heavy cholecystokinin binding is confined to particular areas within the primate basal ganglia ; the pattern of label within the substantia nigra and neostriatum can be linked to intrinsic and afferent connections of these structures .
2255400|In the neostriatum the distribution of binding shows overlap with its topographically organized corticostriatal innervation ; portions of heavily labeled striatum coincide with regions innervated by association cortex of the frontal and temporal lobes , whereas regions of diminished binding correspond to areas innervated mainly by sensory and motor cortex .
22567304|Specifically , we will focus on the embryonic development of an important forebrain structure , the striatum -LRB- also known as the dorsal striatum or neostriatum -RRB- .
22576749|Structural covariance of the neostriatum with regional gray matter volumes .
22582138|In a series of experiments we evaluated the effects of different doses and dose regimens of CIT on MDMA-induced 5-HT depletions in three brain regions -LRB- hippocampus , entorhinal cortex , and neostriatum -RRB- at three time-points -LRB- P12 , P16 , P21 -RRB- during the treatment interval -LRB- P11-20 -RRB- known to induce behavioral alterations when animals are tested as adults .
2259476|Endogenous GABA mediates presynaptic inhibition of spontaneous and evoked excitatory synaptic potentials in the rat neostriatum .
2259476|Nipecotic acid -LRB- 0.1-1 mM -RRB- , a GABA uptake blocker , produced a dose-dependent decrease of the amplitude of kynurenate-sensitive excitatory synaptic potentials recorded in the neostriatum following cortical stimulation .
2259476|These findings show that phaclofen-insensitive GABAB receptors , activated by endogenous GABA , mediate presynaptic inhibition of cortical glutamatergic inputs in the neostriatum .
22623487|Presynaptic modulation by somatostatin in the rat neostriatum is altered in a model of parkinsonism .
22645692|In previous works , we have shown neuronal and synaptic changes in rat neostriatum subjected to hypoxia leading to long-term ubi-protein accumulation .
226567|Ribak CE , Vaughn JE , Roberts E. Glutamic acid decarboxylase -LRB- GAD , EC 4.1.1.15 -RRB- , the enzyme which catalyzes the alpha-decarboxylation of L-glutamate to form the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid -LRB- GABA -RRB- , was localized immunocytochemically in rat neostriatum , pallidum and entopeduncular nucleus .
226567|In the neostriatum the relative numbers of GAD-positive axons terminals per unit area were substantially less than in the pallidum .
226567|In the neostriatum , GAD-positive somata were identified light microscopically as medium-sized neurons with either round or fusiform shapes .
226567|These findings are in accord with the results of studies which have indicated that medium-sized , spinous neurons of the neostriatum give rise to a GABAergic , striatonigral pathway .
2272143|The examinations disclosed that in MD , ANCs distributed along their preferential sites of the brain ; a great number of ANCs were found in the parahippocampus , hippocampus , amygdaloid nucleus , fusiform gyrus , insula , and olfactory bulb , many in the nucleus basalis of Meynert , inferior temporal gyrus , hypothalamus , and brain stem , and a few in the cingulate , frontal and temporal gyri , neostriatum , and mammillary body .
2272343|The fluorescence intensities of DA in the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens septi in El mice were approximately 11-15 % -LRB- P less than 0.01 -RRB- and 13 % -LRB- P less than 0.01 -RRB- lower than in ddY mice .
2272479|Rather , both compounds increased -LRB- hypermasculinized -RRB- neuronal soma area in male MAN -LRB- magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -RRB- , DLRA -LRB- dorsolateral portion of the robust nucleus of the archistriatum -RRB- , and in HVc -LRB- caudal nucleus of the ventral hyperstriatum -RRB- .

23000149|Enkephalin surges in dorsal neostriatum as a signal to eat .
23000149|Here , we provide evidence that enkephalin surges in an anteromedial quadrant of dorsal neostriatum contribute to generating intense consumption of palatable food .
23000149|In dorsal neostriatum , mu opioid receptors are concentrated within striosomes that receive inputs from limbic regions of prefrontal cortex .
23000149|Endogenous > 150 % enkephalin surges in anterior dorsomedial neostriatum were triggered as rats began to consume palatable chocolates .
23000149|Mapping by `` Fos plume '' methods confirmed the hyperphagic effect to be anatomically localized to the anteromedial quadrant of the dorsal neostriatum , whereas other quadrants were relatively ineffective .
23000149|These findings reveal that opioid signals in anteromedial dorsal neostriatum are able to code and cause motivation to consume sensory reward .
23000621|PDE2A mRNA was expressed in medium spiny neurons in neostriatum .

2303856|Intracellular recordings were made in vivo from 9 giant aspiny neurons in the neostriatum of urethane-anesthetized rats .
23045656|Neuroimaging studies using positron emission tomography suggest that reduced dopamine D -LRB- 2 -RRB- receptor availability in the neostriatum is associated with increased vulnerability to drug addiction in humans and experimental animals .

2312789|Patterns of tachykinin expression and localization in developing feline neostriatum .
2312789|The development of tachykinins in the neostriatum was determined qualitatively in order to characterize the ontogeny of an early-forming neostriatal peptidergic system .
2312789|These results indicate that tachykinins are expressed in neostriatal neurons during the early ontogeny of the neostriatum and may function as trophic factors before synaptogenesis .
2314459|Neurons of the neostriatum are richly innervated by cholinergic neurons of intrinsic origin .
231511|At 65 days of age the activities in various regions relative to the cortex were : neostriatum , 1,200 % ; hippocampus/amygdala , 430 % ; hypothalamus , 190 % ; cerebellum , 140 % ; and midbrain , thalamus and pons/medulla , 110 % .
231511|Significant linear increases were found in the neostriatum , hippocampus/amygdala and cortex at 2 -- 65 days of age , in the pons/medulla and thalamus at 2 -- 42 days of age and in the midbrain at 2 -- 21 days of age .
231511|The increase with age was greatest in the neostriatum and the data are consistent with the occurrence of ACE in neurons in this area .
2315370|Corticostriatal and thalamic regulation of amphetamine-induced ascorbate release in the neostriatum .
2315370|Lesions of cerebral cortex and ventromedial nucleus -LRB- VM -RRB- of the thalamus were made in rats to investigate the contribution of these structures to amphetamine -LRB- AMPH -RRB- - induced ascorbate -LRB- AA -RRB- release in the neostriatum as measured by in vivo voltammetry .
2315370|Following a recovery period of at least one week , rats were anesthetized , and electrochemically modified , carbon-fiber electrodes were lowered into the neostriatum .
2315370|Compared to data obtained from sham-operated and unoperated controls , bilateral aspiration lesions of cerebral cortex significantly lowered both the basal level of AA and the amount of AA released by AMPH in the neostriatum .
2315370|Collectively , these results suggest that the corticostriatal pathway and the VM thalamic nuclei participate in the regulation of basal and AMPH-induced AA release in the neostriatum .

2337791|The medial septal nucleus , the nuclei of the diagonal band , the neostriatum , and the basal nucleus were studied in adult and aged Wistar rats .
2341866|We conclude that although synaptic circuits mediate a phasic inhibition in neostriatum , the low level of spontaneous firing of most neostriatal neurons is mainly because of the effects that membrane properties exert on the spontaneous and the evoked synaptic depolarizations in the striatum .

24115954|BACKGROUND : The aim of this study was to determine age , gender , and hemispheric differences in the volume of the human neostriatum -LRB- striatum -RRB- nucleus in healthy humans .
2411862|De Keyser J , De Backer JP , Convents A , Ebinger G , Vauquelin G. By use of the radioligand -LSB- 3H -RSB- spiroperidol , D2 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethylamine -LRB- dopamine -RRB- receptor binding characteristics were studied in calf globus pallidus and compared with those of neostriatum .
2411862|Antagonist competition curves were monophasic and revealed similar affinities for neostriatum and globus pallidus , suggesting a uniform receptor population with one affinity state for antagonists .
2411862|In neostriatum and globus pallidus , respectively , 45 % and 19 % of -LSB- 3H -RSB- spiroperidol binding was displaced with high affinity and the remainder with low affinity .
2411862|In neostriatum , the addition of 0.4 mM GTP resulted in a partial conversion from high - to low-affinity state with a remaining high-affinity component of 15 % .
2411866|Addition of the agonist oxotremorine-M to slices of neostriatum , cerebral cortex , or hippocampus incubated in the presence of myo - -LSB- 2-3H -RSB- inositol and Li + resulted in a large accumulation of labeled inositol phosphates -LRB- 733 , 376 , and 330 % of control , respectively -RRB- .
2411866|Regional differences were observed in the capacity of certain partial agonists to evoke inositol lipid hydrolysis , the most notable being that of bethanechol , which was four times more effective in the neostriatum than in either the cerebral cortex or hippocampus .
2411866|In addition , the full agonists , oxotremorine-M and carbamoylcholine , were more potent stimulators of inositol phosphate release in the neostriatum than in the cerebral cortex .
2411866|The putative M1 selective agonist 4-m-chlorophenylcarbamoyloxy-2-butynyl trimethyl ammonium chloride had little stimulatory effect in any brain region , whereas the putative M1 selective antagonist pirenzepine blocked the enhanced release of inositol phosphates with high affinity in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus -LRB- Ki = 12.1 and 13.9 nM ; `` M1 '' -RRB- but with a lower affinity in the neostriatum -LRB- Ki = 160 nM ; `` M2 '' -RRB- .
2413402|The administration of the 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion -LRB- MPP + -RRB- stereotaxically into the left neostriatum or left median forebrain bundle of female rats resulted in a very large and highly significant loss of dopamine and of its metabolites in the left neostriatum .
24135431|In particular , on day 21 , a significant astrocyte increase was measured in the anterior cingulate cortex , somatosensory area 1 , neostriatum , ventrolateral periaqueductal gray , and nucleus raphe magnus.PERSPECTIVES : These data highlight the relevance of glial cells in chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity as part of the investigation of the role that specific brain areas play in neuropathy .
2413961|The methamphetamine-induced reduction in -LSB- 3H -RSB- sulpiride binding in the rat neostriatum and nucleus accumbens was similarly attenuated in animals pretreated with methamphetamine .

2416786|The major fiber system continued forward through Forel 's fields and ascended into the pallidum from Rpo , Rmes , and LC and into the neostriatum from Rmes and LC .
2417870|These data suggest that the cyclic AMP production induced in rat neostriatum by simultaneous D-1 and D-2 dopamine receptor activation may be inhibited through mu-opioid receptors , whereas on blockade of D-2 dopamine receptors both mu - and delta-opioid receptors may be linked to adenylate cyclase in an inhibitory fashion .
2419370|There are discrete intranuclear distributions of raphe neurons that project to these forebrain and brainstem sites , and there is an overall rostrocaudal topographic order within the raphe with neurons projecting to the neostriatum , amygdala , and substantia nigra residing most rostrally and neurons projecting to the hippocampus and/or locus coeruleus occupying caudal portions of the B6 and superior central nuclei .
24194283|Neuronal dependence of extracellular dopamine , acetylcholine , glutamate , aspartate and gamma-aminobutyric acid -LRB- GABA -RRB- measured simultaneously from rat neostriatum using in vivo microdialysis : reciprocal interactions .
24194283|The neuronal origin of extracellular levels of dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- , acetylcholine -LRB- ACh -RRB- , glutamate -LRB- Glu -RRB- , aspartate -LRB- Asp -RRB- and gamma-aminobutyric acid -LRB- GABA -RRB- simultaneously collected from the neostriatum of halothane anaesthetized rats with in vivo microdialysis was studied .
24194283|The following criteria were applied -LRB- 1 -RRB- sensitivity to K -LRB- + -RRB- - depolarization ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- sensitivity to inhibition of synaptic inactivation mechanisms ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- sensitivity to extracellular Ca -LRB- 2 + -RRB- ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- neuroanatomical regionality ; sensitivity to selective lesions and -LRB- 5 -RRB- sensitivity to chemical stimulation of the characterized pathways.It was found that : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Extracellular DA levels found in perfusates collected from the neostriatum fulfills all the above criteria and therefore the changes in extracellular DA levels measured with microdialysis reflect actual release from functionally active nerve terminals , and so reflect ongoing synaptic transmission .
24194283|-LRB- 3 -RRB- Extracellular Glu , Asp and GABA could be measured in different perfusion media in the rat neostriatum and probably reflect metabolic as well as synaptic release .
24194283|However , -LRB- 4 -RRB- the majority of the extracellular GABA levels found in perfusates collected from the neostriatum may reflect neuronal release , since GABA levels were increased , in a Ca -LRB- 2 + -RRB- - dependent manner , by K -LRB- + -RRB- - depolarization , and could be selectively decreased by an intrinsic neostriatal lesion .
24194283|-LRB- 7 -RRB- Evidence is provided that selective stimulations of nigral DA cell bodies may lead to changes in release patterns from DA terminals in the ipsilateral neostriatum , which are in turn followed by discrete changes in extracellular levels of GABA and Glu in the same region .
24194283|Finally , some methodological considerations are presented to clarify the contribution of neuronal release to extracellular levels of amino acid neurotransmitters in the rat neostriatum .
2421832|The topographical distribution of the proposed amine transmitters dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- , serotonin -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- , noradrenaline -LRB- NA -RRB- , adrenaline and histamine -LRB- HA -RRB- and of the metabolites of DA and 5-HT has been investigated in the neostriatum of the rat .
2422983|In the first and second postnatal weeks very low levels of diffuse GABA-T reactivity are seen in cortex , although cells and neuropil in the neostriatum are already clearly positive neonatally .
2423187|The dense concentration of S2 sites in the caudal caudate-putamen and their overlap with D2 binding sites indicates that the peripallidal neostriatum may play an important role in interactions between dopamine and serotonin .
2423564|Within the telencephalon , the following neural structures receive input from neurons in the LoC and subcoeruleus cell groups : the paleostriatal complex including the paleostriatum augmentatum and lobus parolfactorius , septal nuclei , nucleus accumbens , olfactory tubercle , hippocampus and parahippocampal area , nucleus taeniae , dorsal archistriatum , lateral neostriatum , hyperstriatum dorsale , hyperstriatum ventrale , and preoptic area .
2423564|Large portions of the cerebral hemispheres including the hyperstriatum accessorium , much of the neostriatum and hyperstriatum ventrale , and all but the dorsal portion of the archistriatum receive little or no input from either the locus coeruleus or subcoeruleus cell groups .
2423565|Large portions of the telencephalon including the hyperstriatum accessorium , most of the hyperstriatum ventrale , much of the archistriatum , and much of the neostriatum do not receive projections from AVT or TPc neurons .
2423919|The glutamate decarboxylase - , leucine enkephalin - , methionine enkephalin - and substance P-immunoreactive neurons in the neostriatum of the rat and cat : evidence for partial population overlap .
2423919|Penny GR , Afsharpour S , Kitai ST. We have examined the populations of neurons in the neostriatum of both rat and cat that are immunoreactive for glutamate decarboxylase , -LSB- Leu -RSB- enkephalin , -LSB- Met -RSB- enkephalin and substance P. Neurons that were immunoreactive for glutamate decarboxylase made up 47 % of the neurons in our samples from the rat and ranged from 39 to 49 % of the neurons in the cat .
2423919|Those immunoreactive for -LSB- Leu -RSB- enkephalin made up 44-49 % of the neurons in rat neostriatum , and 38-47 % in the cat , and those immunoreactive for -LSB- Met -RSB- enkephalin made up 36-41 % of the neurons in rat and 43-49 % of the neurons in the cat .
2423919|Most substance P neurons -LRB- particularly the most darkly staining ones -RRB- were , however , clustered such that they were most numerous in the patch compartment of neostriatum ; within the patches the substance P neurons comprised 59 % of neurons in the rat and 55 % in cat , but in the matrix substance P neurons comprised only 32 % of neurons in the rat and 25 % in the cat .
2424564|Quantitative pharmacohistochemistry of acetylcholinesterase in neostriatum of inbred strains of mice .
2424564|A quantitative pharmacohistochemical technique has been used in the present study to assay acetylcholinesterase -LRB- AChE -RRB- activity in the neostriatum of C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice .
2424566|Innervation of substance P neurons by catecholaminergic terminals in the neostriatum .
2424566|In this study we tried to establish by the electron microscopic ` mirror technique ' whether substance P-like immunoreactive neurons in the neostriatum receive synaptic inputs from catecholaminergic , presumably dopaminergic , nigrostriatal axons .
2426551|After 2 weeks of continuous exposure to methylxanthines the dopamine level and turnover rate were unaltered from control in the neostriatum , hypothalamus and cortex .

2427554|Dopaminergic projection from nucleus raphe dorsalis to neostriatum in the rat .
2427554|The existence of a dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- projection from nucleus raphe dorsalis -LRB- RD -RRB- to neostriatum was demonstrated in the rat by combined tyrosine hydroxylase -LRB- TH -RRB- immunohistochemistry and radioautography after retrograde axonal transport of -LSB- 3H -RSB- noradrenaline -LRB- -LSB- 3H -RSB- NA -RRB- .
2427554|It was concluded that -LSB- 3H -RSB- NA had been taken up and retrogradely transported exclusively by catecholamine neurons ; part of the DA cell group in RD projects to the neostriatum ; and that most if not all non-5-HT neurons projecting from RD to neostriatum are likely to be dopaminergic .
2428501|Marked cell bodies were also found in the neostriatum frontolaterale .
24295730|These findings demonstrate that although Mn did not further damage neurotransmitter activity in the neostriatum , ontogenetic exposure to Mn enhances the behavioral toxicity to 6-OHDA .
2432988|These anatomical specializations may affect the origin and processing of synaptic inputs to the neostriatum to provide functionally different routes of neurotransmission through the basal ganglia .
2432992|Substance P-containing terminals in synaptic contact with cholinergic neurons in the neostriatum and basal forebrain : a double immunocytochemical study in the rat .
2432992|Using this procedure , the cell bodies and proximal dendrites of identified cholinergic neurons in the neostriatum were found to receive symmetrical synaptic input from substance P-immunoreactive boutons .
2433142|Afferent and efferent connections of striatal grafts implanted into the ibotenic acid lesioned neostriatum in adult rats .
2434194|Substance P-immunoreactive terminals were found to make synaptic contact with nigral cells exhibiting tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity and retrograde fluorescent labeling following injection of biotinylated lectin into the neostriatum .
2439552|There were moderate projections to the neostriatum and sparse projections to the frontal cortex , substantia innominata , substantia nigra pars compacta -LRB- SNC -RRB- , pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus , ventral part of the central gray matter including the dorsal raphe nucleus , and the mesencephalic and pontine reticular formation .
2440291|The images are affected by the presence of small amounts of naturally occurring paramagnetic substances -- principally iron -- that delineate the neostriatum -LRB- caudate and putamen -RRB- , globus pallidus , red nucleus , substantia nigra , and dentate nucleus , primarily by a decrease in signal secondary to the T2 * effect .
2440291|Dystonias are characterized by abnormalities of the neostriatum predominantly affecting the putamen .
2440291|Choreas are also characterized by abnormalities of the neostriatum but predominantly affecting the caudate nucleus .
24410630|The marginal division -LRB- MrD -RRB- is a neostriatum subregion that links the limbic system and basal nucleus of Meynert ; it is an important subcortical center that is involved in learning and memory .
2441315|The organization of the nucleus basalis-neostriatum complex of the mallard -LRB- Anas platyrhynchos L. -RRB- and its connections with the archistriatum and the paleostriatum complex .
2441315|The pattern of connections between the nucleus basalis , neostriatum , hyperstriatum ventrale , paleostriatum complex and archistriatum in the mallard has been analysed using Nissl material and a combination of neuroanatomical tracing procedures -LRB- autoradiography , horseradish peroxidase and horseradish peroxidase-wheat germ agglutinin histochemistry , lesion/degeneration technique -RRB- .
2441315|The overlying neostriatum frontale can be subdivided into a medial , a dorsal and a ventral intermediate , and a lateral area .
2441315|The nucleus basalis has distinct connections with the ventral layer and sparse connections with the dorsal layer of the intermediate neostriatum , and abundant reciprocal connections with the ventral layer of the hyperstriatum ventrale .
2441315|The ventral intermediate neostriatum also has reciprocal connections with the hyperstriatum ventrale ; its projections overlap partly with those from the nucleus basalis .
2441315|The ventral layer of the intermediate neostriatum frontale has a distinct projection upon the paleostriatum augmentatum .
2441315|The dorsal layer sends fibers to the lateral neostriatum , to the rostral `` sensorimotor '' part of the archistriatum and to the lateral zone of the lobus parolfactorius .
2441315|It is suggested that the pattern of reciprocal connections between the hyperstriatum ventrale and the nucleus basalis and ventral intermediate neostriatum frontale forms the neuroanatomical substrate for a `` comparator-system '' .
2446216|A Golgi study on the neuronal organization of the neostriatum in the mouse .
2446216|The neuronal organization of the neostriatum in mice was studied , using the rapid Golgi method .
2446216|Medium type I neurons were round with spiny dendrites and were found mainly in the caudal portion of the neostriatum .
2446216|Medium type II neurons had numerous thin dendrites and were predominant in the rostral portion of the neostriatum .
2446216|Thus , the neostriatum in the mouse was shown to be composed of a wide variety of projection neurons and only two types of interneurons .
2446902|Synaptic input and local output of dopaminergic neurons in grafts that functionally reinnervate the host neostriatum .
2446902|In adult rats with a unilateral 6-hydroxy-dopamine-induced lesion of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway , grafts of embryonic ventral mesencephalon can establish extensive efferent connections with the previously denervated host neostriatum and can compensate for motor and sensorimotor asymmetries induced by the lesion .
2446902|The dopaminergic neurons of the grafts in the same animals had previously been shown to re-innervate the host neostriatum , to form synaptic connections therein and to attenuate the lesion-induced motor asymmetry that occurred in response to amphetamine -LRB- Freund et al. 1985 -RRB- .
2448003|Serotonin innervation in adult rat neostriatum .
2448003|The distributional features of the serotonin -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- innervation in adult rat neostriatum were examined and quantified using two complementary chemoanatomical methods : 5-HT-immunohistochemistry on serial histological sections and radioautography after -LSB- 3H -RSB- 5-HT uptake in whole cerebral hemisphere slices .
2448003|As visualized and measured after peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunostaining , the neostriatal 5-HT fiber network pervading the entire neostriatum was 2-3 times denser in its ventral than dorsal parts , and showed a slight rostrocaudal increase in density .
2448003|Radioautographic counts of the -LSB- 3H -RSB- 5-HT-labeled axon varicosities within comparable sectors of the neostriatum showed good correlation with this distribution pattern .
2448003|They already allow for meaningful correlations with currently available microchemical data on intrastriatal 5-HT levels and should also be of considerable significance when as precise information becomes available on the number and localization of different 5-HT receptors and uptake carriers within rat neostriatum .
2452178|Three of these areas are sexually dimorphic telencephalic nuclei characteristic of songbirds : the caudal nucleus of the ventral hyperstriatum -LRB- HVc -RRB- , the robust nucleus of the archistriatum -LRB- RA -RRB- , and the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- MAN -RRB- .
2452178|VIP-containing neurons were seen in the surrounding archistriatum and caudal neostriatum but not in RA itself .
2452877|M-1 and M-2 muscarinic receptor-mediated inhibition of dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase in rat neostriatum : a permissive role for D-2 dopamine receptors .
2454418|In order to learn what morphological substrate might underly the histochemical compartments of the neostriatum , sections of the caudate nucleus and the putamen of cats and ferrets were stained immunocytochemically with antisera directed against several neuropeptides and transmitter-related enzymes and were then Golgi-impregnated .
2454418|We conclude that there is a specific cytoarchitecture underlying the histochemical compartments of the neostriatum and that different sub-populations of medium-size spiny neurons underly -LRB- 1 -RRB- the segregation of information flow in striosomes and the extrastriosomal matrix and -LRB- 2 -RRB- communication between striosomes and the extrastriosomal matrix .
2454839|The postsynaptic targets of substance P-immunoreactive terminals in the rat neostriatum with particular reference to identified spiny striatonigral neurons .
2454839|Author information : -LRB- 1 -RRB- MRC Anatomical Neuropharmacology Unit , Department of Pharmacology , Oxford , U.K. Substance P-immunoreactive boutons were examined in the electron microscope in sections of the rat neostriatum that contained retrogradely labelled striatonigral neurons and/or Golgi-impregnated medium-size densely spiny neurons .
2458391|Few were found in the dorsolateral quadrant of the neostriatum .
2460191|Excitotoxic lesions of the neostriatum cause anatomical and biochemical changes resembling those occurring in Huntington 's disease .
2461435|Anterograde degeneration was used to `` stain , '' at the electron-microscopic level , the axon terminals of neurons projecting to RA from hyperstriatum ventralis , pars caudalis -LRB- HVc -RRB- and from the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- L-MAN -RRB- .
2463046|Selective decrease of large neurons in the neostriatum in progressive supranuclear palsy .
2463046|In order to evaluate the quantitative changes in the neostriatum in progressive supranuclear palsy -LRB- PSP -RRB- , sections of the caudate head -LRB- CN -RRB- and putamen -LRB- PT -RRB- from 4 PSP patients were stained with Klver-Barrera , and the cell body and nuclear area of the neurons were measured by a digitizer .

2463335|Receptor binding studies were performed in cerebral cortex -LRB- CTX -RRB- and neostriatum -LRB- CPU ; caudate-putamen -RRB- using the dopamine D1 antagonist -LSB- 3H -RSB- SCH23390 .
24639075|Surprisingly , its organization within the PSD of spiny excitatory neurons of neocortex and hippocampus differed from that within spiny inhibitory neurons of neostriatum and cerebellar cortex .
2464011|Connections of a telencephalic vocal-control nucleus , the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- lMAN -RRB- , were studied in adult male zebra finches .
2464011|In addition , we replicated results of previous experiments with canaries showing that the song-control nucleus HVc -LRB- caudal nucleus of the ventral hyperstriatum -RRB- receives input from three sources : the medial magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- mMAN -RRB- , the interfacial nucleus -LRB- NIf -RRB- , and the uvae-form nucleus -LRB- Uva -RRB- of the thalamus .
2466392|Centrally administered galanin reduces dopamine utilization in the median eminence and increases dopamine utilization in the medial neostriatum of the male rat .
2467720|Cell suspensions of fetal neostriatum were transplanted into the adult rat neostriatum lesioned previously by kainic acid .
2467720|Horseradish peroxidase injections into the ipsilateral ventral midbrain labelled the lesion site and the intact neostriatum extensively , but no appreciable anterograde or retrograde label was found within the graft .
24685534|In the previous works , we have shown neuronal and synaptic changes in rat neostriatum subjected to hypoxia that leads to ubi-protein accumulation .
24685534|We used 2 different protocols of hypothermia : -LRB- a -RRB- intrahypoxic hypothermia at 15  C and -LRB- b -RRB- post-hypoxia hypothermia at 32  C. Consistent with previous data at 30 days , staining with phalloidin-Alexa -LRB- 488 -RRB- followed by confocal microscopy analysis showed an increase of F-actin fluorescent staining in the neostriatum of hypoxic animals .
2473410|Neuronal and glial elements of fetal neostriatal grafts in the adult neostriatum .
2474771|Previous studies have shown that most of the cholinergic input to the brain arises from choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons found in the neostriatum , basal forebrain and dorsolateral pontine tegmentum .
2477034|The ` marginal division ' : a new subdivision in the neostriatum of the rat .
2477034|Using a combination of anterograde and retrograde -LRB- Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin ; PHA-L and wheat germ agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase ; WGA-HRP -RRB- tract-tracing methods and histochemical techniques , a new subdivision of the neostriatum , the marginal division , has been found in the rat brain .
2477034|The marginal division is approximately 120 microns wide and is located at the caudal extent of the neostriatum and surrounds the rostral edge of the globus pallidus .
2477034|Histochemically , the marginal division is lighter in AChE staining , is more densely filled with Met-enkephalin-immunoreactive terminals , and has fewer choline acetyltransferase -LRB- ChAT -RRB- - immunoreactive neurons than does the rest of the neostriatum .
2477034|In contrast , the projection from the main region of the neostriatum terminates in two bands in the globus pallidus , both of which are rostral to the area of termination of the fibres from the marginal division .
2477034|The striatonigral fibres from the marginal division terminate in the caudal part of the substantia nigra pars reticulata whereas the rest of neostriatum projects to a more rostral region .
2477034|Based on its cellular morphology , immunohistochemistry and projection pattern , we conclude that the marginal division of the striatum is a distinct subdivision of the neostriatum .
2477271|Host afferents into fetal ventral mesencephalic tissue grafted to the neostriatum of adult rats have been studied by using anterograde transport of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin -LRB- PHA-L -RRB- and immunocytochemistry for serotonin -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- , Substance P -LRB- SP -RRB- , and dopamine-adenosine 3 ' :5 ' - monophosphate-regulated-phosphoprotein-32 -LRB- DARPP-32 -RRB- .
2478933|Preamyloid deposits and amyloid deposits with or without degenerating neurites were present in cortex , neostriatum , medial geniculate body and thalamic -LRB- anterior and extralaminar -RRB- nuclei , whereas preamyloid deposits and amyloid deposits without degenerating neurites , but not amyloid deposits with degenerating neurites , were present in other thalamic nuclei , in the globus pallidus , brainstem , cerebellar cortex and upper spinal cord .
2479447|Taken together , the results suggest that -LRB- 1 -RRB- there is a unique neurolinguistic profile for spontaneous language production for each neurodegenerative disease , -LRB- 2 -RRB- pathology of the neostriatum disrupts syntactic organization , -LRB- 3 -RRB- adaptive strategies are used to cope with verbal and speech-motor difficulties , and -LRB- 4 -RRB- adaptive strategies fail to be effective with increasing disease severity .
24873960|Neurogenesis in the rat neostriatum .
24873960|Author information : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Department of Biology , Indiana-Purdue University , 1125 East 38th Street , Indianapolis , IN 46223 , U.S.A. Neurogenesis in the rat neostriatum was examined with -LSB- -LRB- 3 -RRB- H -RSB- thymidine autoradiography .
24873960|The medium-sized neurons throughout the neostriatum are generated in a prominent ventrolateral-to-dorsomedial gradient so that ventrolateral cells originate mainly between E14 and E18 , dorsomedial cells between E18 and E21-22 -LRB- fewer than 10 % originate between P0 and P4 -RRB- .
24875949|Although we can not rule out possible non-specific or toxic effects of the drugs , these observations support the conclusion that presynaptic dopamine may be important for development of target neurons in the neostriatum .
2487634|Control lesions were made in the lateral neostriatum .
2487634|Only the moderate -LRB- EC + EB -RRB- group was significantly different from the neostriatum controls .
24904436|We defined three regions of interest -LRB- ROIs -RRB- : the ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- including medial orbitofrontal cortex and subgenual and rostral anterior cingulate cortex -RRB- , the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- i.e. , superior medial frontal cortex -RRB- , and the neostriatum -LRB- caudate and putamen -RRB- .
2495149|In contrast , chronic morphine had no effect on pertussis toxin-mediated ADP-ribosylation of Gi and Go in the other brain regions studied , including the neostriatum , frontal cortex , and dorsal raphe .
2496330|One of these , DARPP-32 -LRB- dopamine and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein , Mr 32,000 -RRB- , is specifically enriched in medium-sized spiny neurons of the neostriatum and in the projection of these neurons upon pallidal regions .
2496331|Dopamine-regulated phosphorylation of synaptic vesicle-associated proteins in rat neostriatum and substantia nigra .
2496331|Dopamine , acting through dopamine D1 receptors and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase , has been found to increase the state of phosphorylation of the synaptic vesicle-associated phosphoproteins synapsin I and protein III in slices of rat neostriatum and substantia nigra .
2496331|In the neostriatum , the effect of dopamine was mimicked by SKF 38393 , a D2 receptor agonist , and was abolished by preincubation of the slices with fluphenazine or SCH 23390 , antipsychotic drugs which are potent D1 receptor antagonists , but not by the D2 receptor antagonists l-sulpiride or spiroperidol .
2496331|The maximal effect of dopamine in the neostriatum represented approximately 30-35 % of the maximal effect induced by 8-bromo cyclic AMP , suggesting that a similar fraction of nerve terminals in the neostriatum may express the dopamine D1 receptor .
2496331|Evidence for a small population of beta-adrenergic receptors regulating nerve terminal protein phosphorylation in the neostriatum , distinct from the D1 dopamine receptors , was also obtained .
2496331|The ability of dopamine D1 receptor activation to stimulate both synapsin I and protein III phosphorylation and GABA release in both the neostriatum and substantia nigra may be causally linked .
24968774|Over the years since the discovery of dopamine in the neostriatum , we have learned much about the anatomy of this large subcortical nucleus .
2496892|Following ibotenic acid-induced neuronal degeneration of the neostriatum in the rat , we observed a sharp elevation of the GFAP transcripts -LRB- 4-fold -RRB- as soon as 2 days after the lesion both in the striatum and in the substantia nigra .
2498635|This effect was also specific to the LC , in that it was not observed in the other brain regions examined , which included the dorsal raphe , neostriatum , and frontal cortex .
25063429|DARPP32 labeling in WT and TgHD minipig neostriatum was patchy .
2507846|It was found that , similar to chronic morphine , chronic -LRB- 2 weeks -RRB- clonidine administration , under conditions that produce electrophysiological evidence of tolerance and dependence in LC neurons , increased levels of adenylate cyclase activity and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity in this brain region , but not in several other regions studied , which included the frontal cortex , neostriatum , and dorsal raphe .
25086835|Following systemic -LRB- i.p. -RRB- administration of 10 mg/kg salsolinol , this molecule was detected in vivo by microdialysis of neostriatum , reaching an estimated concentration of 100 nM in the dialyzate .
2514009|Author information : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Department of Preclinical Veterinary Sciences , University of Edinburgh , Summerhall , U.K. Golgi-impregnated medium-size spiny neurones were studied in the rat neostriatum at various times after a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion of the medial forebrain bundle .
2514464|Dye-coupling in the neostriatum of the rat : I. Modulation by dopamine-depleting lesions .
2514464|The present experiment was aimed at determining if DA has a similar role in the mammalian neostriatum .
2514464|In animals with electrolytic nigral lesions , dye-coupling in the ipsilateral neostriatum occurred after 38 % of the intracellular injections .
2514464|After 6-OHDA lesions , 19 % of the injections produced dye-coupling in the ipsilateral neostriatum .
2514464|The results suggest that DA may function in the neostriatum to control permeability of gap junctions .
2515504|Increased diffusion of prolactin-like material into the brain neuropil from homologous adenohypophyseal transplants in the rat neostriatum after a 6-OH-dopamine induced degeneration of the mesostriatal dopamine neurons .
2515504|The transplants were stereotaxically placed unilaterally into the intact and 6-hydroxy-dopamine -LRB- 6-OH-DA -RRB- denervated neostriatum .
2515504|In the 6-OH-DA-denervated neostriatum the zone of prolactin-like immunoreactivity was increased in the neuropil surrounding the adenohypophyseal transplant compared with that in the non-denervated neostriatum .
2526301|Effects of sodium , lithium , and magnesium on in vitro binding of -LSB- 3H -RSB- SCH23390 in rat neostriatum and cerebral cortex .
2526301|The effects of sodium , lithium , and magnesium on the in vitro binding properties of the D1 antagonist -LSB- 3H -RSB- SCH23390 were examined with membrane preparations from rat neostriatum -LRB- CPU ; caudate-putamen -RRB- and cerebral cortex -LRB- CTX -RRB- .
2527300|The binding properties of the substituted benzamide raclopride to dopamine D2 receptors were studied with membrane preparations from rat and rabbit neostriatum .
2527300|Examination of saturation curves at equilibrium revealed a single class of binding sites in the neostriatum from both species -LRB- rat : maximum binding capacity -LRB- Bmax -RRB- = 247 fmol/mg of protein ; rabbit : Bmax = 337 fmol/mg of protein -RRB- .
2527300|The selectivity in the neostriatum was examined by competition experiments with dopaminergic drugs .
25273896|The caudate nucleus , as a part of the striatum -LRB- neostriatum or dorsal striatum -RRB- , is involved in the control of cognitive , motor and limbic functions .
25274077|The memory function of the hippocampal formation -LRB- Hip -RRB- and the marginal division -LRB- MrD -RRB- of neostriatum was compared .
2527585|In rat neostriatum , dopamine D-2 receptors are not homogeneously distributed : in the caudate-putamen the density is laterally higher than medially .
2529545|Highest concentrations of D2 mRNA were found in neostriatum , olfactory tubercle , substantia nigra , ventral tegmental area , and the nucleus accumbens .
2530315|Previous studies have shown that the mammalian neostriatum contains two subtypes of D2 dopamine receptors , which can be distinguished on the basis of the ability of GTP to convert high -LRB- RH -RRB- into low -LRB- RL -RRB- affinity sites for dopamine : GTP-sensitive -LRB- GS -RRB- and GTP-insensitive -LRB- GI -RRB- D2 receptors .
2530315|The GI-D2 receptors in rat and human neostriatum are confined to the corticostriatal terminals .
25323423|Additionally , the extraneuronal , microdialysate , content of HO -LRB-  -RRB- in neostriatum was likewise elevated in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats .
25323423|Interestingly , there was no difference in extraneuronal HO -LRB-  -RRB- formation in the neostriatum of Mn-exposed versus control rats .

2533094|The results obtained with the muscarinic antagonists indicate that 'M -2 type ' muscarinic receptors mediate ACh release in the neostriatum , but further pharmacological analyses are required to assign with certainty the receptor subtype involved in neostriatal ACh release .
25359848|Dendrites of neurons in the rat neostriatum were visualized using a recombinant viral vector .
2537344|For example , mu , delta , and kappa receptors were all abundant within several parts of the cortical-equivalent region of the telencephalon , particularly the hyperstriatum ventrale and the medial neostriatum .
2537344|In contrast , in other parts of the cortical-equivalent region of the avian telencephalon , such as the dorsal archistriatum and caudal neostriatum , only kappa receptors appeared to be abundant .

25447911|Huntington 's disease -LRB- HD -RRB- is an autosomal dominant triplet repeat genetic disease , which results in progressive neuronal degeneration in the neostriatum and neocortex , and associated functional impairments in motor , cognitive , and psychiatric domains .
2545012|The present study presents evidence , using lesion-induced degenerations of pre - and postsynaptic neuronal populations in the neostriatum and substantia nigra , that calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II , as measured both by autophosphorylation of enzyme subunits and by synapsin I kinase activity , is present in high concentrations in several populations of presynaptic terminals .

2561956|Quinolinic acid-induced degeneration of neostriatal neurons and the straitonigral fibers emanating from neostriatal neurons decreased the activities of both cyclic nucleotide-dependent enzymes by 70-85 % in the neostriatum , while cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase was decreased by 44 % and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase was decreased by 18 % in the substantia nigra .

25907331|BACKGROUND : Huntington 's disease -LRB- HD -RRB- is an autosomal , dominantly inherited and progressive neurodegenerative disease , nosologically classified as the presence of intranuclear inclusion bodies and the loss of GABA-containing neurons in the neostriatum and subsequently in the cerebellar cortex .
25908399|The recent electrophysiological characterization of TH-expressing GABAergic interneurons -LRB- THINs -RRB- in the neostriatum revealed an unexpected degree of diversity of interneurons in this brain area -LRB- Ibez-Sandoval et al. , 2010 , Unal et al. , 2011 , 2015 -RRB- .
25908399|Powerful modulation of the nonlinear integrative properties of THINs by dopamine and the direct depolarization of these neurons by acetylcholine may play important roles in mediating the effects of these neuromodulators in the neostriatum with potentially important implications for understanding the mechanisms of neuropsychiatric disorders affecting the basal ganglia .
25962893|This case exhibited typical neuropathological features as Huntington 's disease , including severe degeneration of the neostriatum and widespread occurrence of ubiquitin and expanded polyglutamine-positive neuronal intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions .
25971780|INTRODUCTION : Huntington 's disease -LRB- HD -RRB- is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by an expanded CAG repeat -LRB- greater than 38 -RRB- on the short arm of chromosome 4 , resulting in loss and dysfunction of neurons in the neostriatum and cortex , leading to cognitive decline , motor dysfunction , and death , typically occurring 15 to 20 years after the onset of motor symptoms .
25979353|RESULTS : The behaviour of the system was assessed by comparison with the batch method and using a well-characterized animal model of excitotoxic damage , based on the application of high concentrations -LRB- 1mM and 500?M -RRB- of the non-NMDA glutamate receptor agonist kainate -LRB- KA -RRB- to the neostriatum .
2598010|First , using immunocytochemistry and histochemistry , the host serotonergic -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- , dopaminergic -LRB- DA , stained with anti-tyrosine hydroxylase -LRB- TH -RRB- antiserum -RRB- , and acetylcholinesterase -LRB- AChE -RRB- fibers exhibited vigorous growth into the grafts implanted in neostriatum , lateral ventricle , globus pallidus or substantia nigra within a period of 6 and 10 weeks .
2598010|Finally , with the retrograde-transport marker -LRB- horseradish peroxidase method , the grafts implanted in neostriatum were found incapable of sending fibers to a major , distal target , substantia nigra .
2598036|Correlative decrease of large neurons in the neostriatum and basal nucleus of Meynert in Alzheimer 's disease .
2598036|A quantitative investigation was performed on the large neurons in the neostriatum and basal nucleus of Meynert -LRB- bnM -RRB- in patients with Alzheimer 's disease -LRB- AD -RRB- and progressive supranuclear palsy -LRB- PSP -RRB- .
2598036|The degree of decrease of the large neurons in the neostriatum was quite similar to that in the bnM ; these decreases were significantly correlative in AD , but not in PSP .
2598036|These findings indicate that the large neurons in the neostriatum and bnM , which are considered to be cholinergic and to exclusively possess nerve growth factor receptors in the cerebrum , degenerate simultaneously in an equal ratio in AD .
2598544|Several senile plaques were also found in the amygdala , innominate substance , neostriatum , claustrum , thalamus , hypothalamus and tegmentum of the mesencephalon .
2598544|No obvious neuronal loss was noted in the nucleus basalis of Meynert , neostriatum , substantia nigra or locus ceruleus , which are well known to be involved in Alzheimer 's disease and SDAT .
2609252|Dye-coupling in the neostriatum of the rat : II .
26096780|In the cerebral cortex and the neostriatum , frequency of the inclusions was well correlated with neuronal loss .
2612620|It was noted that reduction of the influence of activating cerebral structures is a tool for abolishing the proepileptic effects which occur in some cases under conditions of electrical stimulations of neostriatum .
2619428|Localization of muscarinic receptors was determined by autoradiography using -LSB- 3H -RSB- - quinuclidinyl benzilate -LRB- -LSB- 3H -RSB- - QNB -RRB- as a ligand on brain sections of the frontoparietal and the temporal cortex , the neostriatum and the hippocampus .
2619428|A high density of muscarinic receptors was found primarily in the neostriatum , followed , in descending order , by the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus .
26215117|The present study examined effects of the ortho-substituted PCB 153 on dopamine , serotonin and amino acid neurotransmitters in the neostriatum of both male and female Wistar Kyoto -LRB- WKY -RRB- and spontaneously hypertensive rat -LRB- SHR -RRB- genotypes .
26256420|Phosphodiesterase 10A inhibitor , MP-10 -LRB- PF-2545920 -RRB- , produces greater induction of c-Fos in dopamine D2 neurons than in D1 neurons in the neostriatum .
26256420|MP-10 -LRB- 1 , 3 , 10 or 30 mg/kg , PO -RRB- dose-dependently increased c-Fos immunopositive nuclei in all regions of neostriatum .
26295019|These markers were increased but the changes were specific : MnOE increased TfR and decreased Tf in hippocampus , whereas FeD increased TfR in neostriatum and increased TfR and DMT1 in the hippocampus , and the combination increased TfR in neostriatum -LRB- zip8 was unaffected -RRB- .
2643254|Many of the NPY immunoreactive neurons present in the subnuclei of the nucleus tractus solitarius also contained nuclear GR IR , while most of the NPY immunoreactive perikarya of the cerebral cortex and all of the neostriatum appeared to lack GR IR .
2643254|These results indicate that NPY immunoreactive neurons in the upper and lower brain stem , but not in the cerebral cortex and in the neostriatum may be directly involved in mediating central effects of glucocorticoids .
2657951|The neostriatum receives a major input from the intralaminar thalamic nuclei -LRB- ITN -RRB- .
26616014|Zinc chloride and zinc acetate solutions injected in a dose of 1 ?g into the rostral neostriatum produced opposite effect on locomotor behavior of rats .
26616014|It was hypothesized that important factors here were the relationship between the effect and the level of metal released after salt dissociation and different reactivity of the synaptic substrate of the neostriatum to the presence of zinc ions .
26648848|The human neostriatum consists of two functional subdivisions referred to as the striosome -LRB- patch -RRB- and matrix compartments .
26648848|Here , we used a highly sensitive immunohistochemistry technique to show that in the human neostriatum , PSD-95 is differentially concentrated in the striosome and matrix compartments , with a higher density of PSD-95 labeling in the matrix compartment than in the striosomes .
26727032|Lister-hooded rats either remained as unoperated controls or received unilateral excitotoxic lesions of the lateral neostriatum .
2674513|By this typical pattern Alzheimer disease can be differentiated from other dementia syndromes , as e.g. Pick 's disease -LRB- with the metabolic depression most prominent in the frontal and temporal lobe -RRB- , multi infarct dementia -LRB- with multiple focal metabolic defects -RRB- , and Huntington 's chorea -LRB- with metabolic disturbance in the neostriatum -RRB- .
26746579|Here , we present the first long-term longitudinal multi-occasion investigation of changes in iron content and volume in the neostriatum in a sample of healthy middle-aged and older adults -LRB- N = 32 ; ages 49-83years at baseline -RRB- .
2674955|In vivo electrochemical studies of the effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- on dopamine nerve terminals in the neostriatum of the anesthetized rat .

26829944|Using real-time polymerase chain reaction , immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry we found that the GABAergic markers were significantly decreased in most sectors of cerebral neocortex , the neostriatum , and the cerebellum of HIV-infected subjects .
26872373|Dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein Mr 32,000 -LRB- DARPP-32 -RRB- , also known as phosphoprotein phosphatase-1 regulatory subunit 1B -LRB- PPP1R1B -RRB- , was initially discovered as a substrate of dopamine-activated protein kinase A -LRB- PKA -RRB- in the neostriatum in the brain .
2706468|Serotonin innervation in adult rat neostriatum .
2706468|High-resolution radioautography after cerebroventricular administration of tritiated serotonin -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- and PAP immunocytochemistry with an antiserum against 5-HT-glutaraldehyde conjugate -LRB- kindly donated by M. Geffard -RRB- were used in parallel to investigate the intrinsic and relational fine structural features of 5-HT axon varicosities -LRB- terminals -RRB- in the neostriatum of the adult rat .
2706468|The uptake-labeled varicosities were examined in single thin sections from a paraventricular sector of neostriatum , whereas their immunostained counterparts were viewed in serial thin sections from the same paraventricular sector plus a dorsal neostriatal sector .
2706468|Serotonin axon terminals were generally small and , as measured in immunostained material , even smaller in the dorsal than in the paraventricular neostriatum .
2706468|Only 10-13 % of 5-HT varicosities from either the paraventricular or the dorsal neostriatum exhibited a synaptic junction , in contrast with a junctional incidence of at least 70 % for randomly selected axonal varicosities similarly sampled in the surrounding neuropil .
2706468|The synaptic and appositional features of immunostained 5-HT varicosities were similar for both the dorsal and the paraventricular neostriatum .
2706468|In this context , it is likely that the effects of 5-HT in the neostriatum are exerted upon a multiplicity of cellular target sites in addition to the restricted number of dendritic spines and shafts synaptically contacted by this type of monoamine terminal .
2706523|The sulfated octapeptide of cholecystokinin -LRB- CCK-8S -RRB- and CCK fragments were administered to mice to determine the subtype and central versus peripheral location of the CCK receptor that modulates dopamine release in the neostriatum .
2706771|By combining -LSB- 3H -RSB- thymidine autoradiography with choline acetyltransferase -LRB- ChAT -RRB- immunocytochemistry , we have determined the generation pattern of the large cholinergic neurons in the neostriatum .
2706771|Cholinergic neurons appeared to be among the earliest cells produced in the neostriatum when compared with previous generation studies of all neurons in the rat caudate-putamen .
2706771|Additional immunocytochemical studies detected ChAT immunoreactivity within somata and primary dendrites of 1 day postnatal -LRB- 1 dpn -RRB- rat neostriatum , and subsequently demonstrated a dramatic increase in the intensity of reaction product and the complexity of dendritic arborizations by 14 dpn .
2706771|Large ChAT-positive neurons of the basal forebrain contained within the same specimens appeared to differentiate their cholinergic phenotype earlier than those in the neostriatum .
2706771|This then represents an example of cholinergic projection -LRB- basal forebrain system -RRB- and local circuit -LRB- neostriatum -RRB- neurons that share similar generation patterns but differ with respect to sequences of transmitter phenotype expression .
2707350|The Ca + + - dependence of the repetitive firing of neostriatal neurons was studied in an in vitro slice preparation of the rat neostriatum .
2709448|The acute effects of lithium on the central catecholamine and serotonin systems were investigated in well-defined cortical areas in the rat : the anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- CIN -RRB- , the piriform-entorhinal region -LRB- PiEn -RRB- , and the primary visual area -LRB- VIS -RRB- as well as in the hippocampus -LRB- HIP -RRB- , the neostriatum -LRB- CPU ; caudateputamen -RRB- , and the olfactory bulbs -LRB- OBs -RRB- .
2710337|The cellular localization of adenosine receptors in rat neostriatum .
2710337|Alexander SP -LRB- 1 -RRB- , Reddington M. Author information : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Max Planck Institute for Psychiatry , Department of Neuromorphology , Martinsried , F.R.G. Using quantitative autoradiography of ligand binding sites combined with lesions of specific neuronal pathways , the cellular locations of A1 and A2 adenosine receptors , as well as a third binding site for the adenosine receptor ligand , -LSB- 3H -RSB- N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine , and a nucleoside transporter were investigated in rat neostriatum .
2710337|These results indicate the localization of both A1 and A2 adenosine receptors on neurons intrinsic to the neostriatum and probably postsynaptic to the dopaminergic input .
2713646|This pattern of accumulation in the song system differs from that observed in a previous study in which bay wrens were injected with tritiated testosterone -LRB- T -RRB- ; T or its metabolites were accumulated by cells in HVc , RA -LRB- robust nucleus of the archistriatum -RRB- , MAN -LRB- magnocellular nucleus of the neostriatum -RRB- , ICo , and nXII -LRB- hypoglossal -LRB- nucleus -RRB- .
2713723|Mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons were electrophysiologically identified by a variety of criteria , including antidromic activation from prefrontal or cingulate cortex , neostriatum , or nucleus accumbens in urethane-anesthetized rats .
2713731|The DA levels in the nucleus accumbens and the lateral part of the neostriatum were increased by approximately 45 % -LRB- p less than 0.01 -RRB- and 25-35 % -LRB- p less than 0.01 -RRB- , respectively , by the IVT administration of CaCl2 -LRB- 10 mumol/kg -RRB- .
2725951|Five days after hypoxia the NGF content was increased in neostriatum , hippocampus and cerebral neocortex , areas exhibiting focal neuronal degeneration and inflammation .
27287|Receptor-linked cyclic AMP systems in rat neostriatum : differential localization revealed by kainic acid injection .
27287|Various receptor-linked cyclic AMP systems were measured in rat neostriatum 2 -- 14 days after selective destruction of neuronal cell bodies and dendrites by micro-injection of 3 microgram of kainic acid .
27287|The results suggest differential cellular localizations of the various receptor-linked cyclic AMP systems in rat neostriatum .
2739900|The neostriatal primodia from 15-18-day embryos were used to make a cell suspension which was implanted unilaterally into the rat neostriatum 3-5 days after kainic acid lesion .
2739900|There were many Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin labeled cortical fibers in the host neostriatum .
2739900|The morphology of labeled fibers in the graft differed from that of corticostriatal fibers from the same injection but distributing in the host neostriatum .
2739900|The labeled fibers in the host neostriatum arborized in an extended pattern , branching infrequently and making most of their synapses en passant at varicosities along their courses .
2739900|The cellular composition and the structure of the neuropil in the neostriatal grafts were similar to that of the neostriatum .
2739900|More than 90 % of the labeled cortical terminals in the host neostriatum contacted dendritic spines whereas only 47 % of the labeled terminals in the grafts contacted spines , and 50 % of them terminated on the dendritic shafts .
2743120|Early exposure to estrogen establishes this sensitivity to androgens and increases the number of androgen-accumulating cells in two song regions , the hyperstriatum ventralis pars caudalis -LRB- HVc -RRB- and the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum .
2743163|These results , which confirm the heterogeneity of amphetamine-induced effects in the neostriatum , indicate that the baseline motor-response characteristics of neostriatal neurons may determine their response to amphetamine .
2743564|The acetylcholine -LRB- ACh -RRB- , dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- and noradrenaline -LRB- NA -RRB- concentrations in the song control nuclei , the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- MAN -RRB- , the caudal nucleus of the ventral hyperstriatum -LRB- HVc -RRB- and the robust nucleus of the archistriatum -LRB- RA -RRB- were measured using high performance liquid chromatography -LRB- HPLC -RRB- at 5 different ages -LRB- 30 , 40 , 50 , 60 and 90 days after hatching -RRB- .
2747916|Nerve growth factor effects on cholinergic neurons of neostriatum and nucleus accumbens in the adult rat .
2747916|Following intraventricular nerve growth factor infusion in adult rats , the choline acetyltransferase immunostaining of the neuropil and neuronal cell bodies of the neostriatum -LRB- caudate-putamen -RRB- and nucleus accumbens was more intense on the side of the infusion .
2748871|Centrally -LRB- i.c.v. -RRB- or peripherally -LRB- s.c. -RRB- administered CCK-8S lowers DA release , and to a lesser extent , metabolism , in the neostriatum and olfactory tubercle .
2760844|As in many other cholinergic systems , the agonists tested in this study were not selective in their action on ACh release modulation in the rat neostriatum .
2760844|The antagonists , however , were more selective in their action , i.e. , pirenzepine was relatively ineffective , and on the basis of this selective action , it can be concluded that modulation of endogenous ACh release in the rat neostriatum is mediated by a M-2 muscarinic receptor subtype .
2761669|PAG staining was also observed in large neurons of the rat neostriatum .
2762838|It was found that the projection areas of brachial afferents were located within the neostriatum , the hyperstriatum and the ectostriatum .
2762838|The sciatic projection areas overlap with the brachial projection areas in the neostriatum and a part of the hyperstriatum .
2769261|The present study , using chemical and surgical lesions of neurons in the rat neostriatum and substantia nigra , has examined whether the 87-kDa protein is colocalized with protein kinase C in identified neurons and nerve terminals .
2771044|Higher concentrations -LRB- 100 micrograms/ml -RRB- of tetanus toxin reduced the excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus as well as in the neostriatum .
2771044|We conclude that , although the toxin 's mechanisms of action in the neostriatum are similar to those operating in the hippocampus -LRB- i.e. decrease of inhibitory and/or excitatory inputs -RRB- , the local synaptic circuits produce differential electrophysiological effects in these two structures .
2786440|These clinical , anatomical and functional observations emphasize the role of the circuits linking the prefrontal associative cortex and some specific areas of the neostriatum , including the pallidum .
2788252|Stimulation of GABA release from the rat neostriatum and globus pallidus in vivo by corticotropin-releasing factor .
2788252|These results thus demonstrate that CRF can exert potent effects on GABA release within the rat neostriatum-pallidum by increasing the membrane excitability of GABA neurons/terminals and that such effects are mediated via receptors present on both the cell bodies/terminals of GABA-containing neurones .
2792249|There are two somatosensory areas in the telencephalon of the pigeon which receive an input from the spinal somatosensory system : one in the rostral Wulst which consists of the three hyperstriatal layers -LRB- h. accessorium -LRB- HA -RRB- , h. intercalatus superior -LRB- HIS -RRB- and h. dorsale -LRB- HD -RSB- and one in the caudal telencephalon -LRB- neostriatum caudale -LRB- NC -RRB- , neostriatum intermedium -LRB- NI -RRB- and hyperstriatum ventrale -LRB- HV -RSB- .

2794143|In order to understand the developmental sequences leading to the adult compartmental organization of the primate neostriatum , a quantitative technique was used to study the ontogeny of pre - and postsynaptic components of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurons in baboon caudate nucleus and putamen .
2794995|Lateral MAN -LRB- magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -RRB- is a forebrain nucleus that is known to be importantly involved with vocal learning in juvenile male zebra finches only during a restricted period of the learning process : lesions of lMAN completely disrupt song behavior in zebra finches prior to 50 days of age but have little or no effect in older juvenile or adult birds .
2794998|We were unable to detect any significant changes in neuron number within the magnocellular nucleus of the neostriatum or the robust nucleus of the archistriatum during either stage of song learning .
2797191|A particularly striking example is the pattern of glomeruli in the olfactory bulbs ; other instances are columns and ` blobs ' in the visual cortex , barrels and columns in the somatosensory cortex , and striasomes and cell islands in the neostriatum .
2806641|-LSB- Avoidance conditioned-reflex behavior in rats chronically administered leucine enkephalin and its synthetic tetrapeptide analog into the neostriatum -RSB- .
2806641|The three-week daily administration of 5 and 15 micrograms leu-enkephalin and its synthetic tetrapeptide analogue into the rat neostriatum led to an inhibition of avoidance conditioning in shuttlebox .

2819469|Neurotensin counteracts apomorphine-induced inhibition of dopamine release as studied by microdialysis in rat neostriatum .
2819469|Microdialysis in the neostriatum of the halothane-anesthetized male rats was used to study the effect of neurotensin on the release of dopamine and its metabolites in the absence or presence of systemic apomorphine treatment .
2819469|The results indicate a facilitatory effect of neurotensin on dopamine release in rat neostriatum .
2819481|Distribution of monoamines and metabolites in rabbit neostriatum , hippocampus and cortex .
2819481|The DA levels were highest in the neostriatum , moderate in the EnPi and CIN and very low in the SSC , VIS and hippocampus .
2819481|The distribution of NA was more uniform , although higher concentrations were measured in the neostriatum , hippocampus and EnPi .
2822779|The laminar distribution of these neurons was compared to that of cortical cells stained retrogradely after injection of wheat germ agglutinin/HRP in the ipsilateral or contralateral neostriatum .
2822779|These morphological features were shared by cortical neurons projecting to contralateral neocortex but not responding antidromically to stimulation of contralateral neostriatum , but they were not shared by brainstem-projecting cortical cells .
2822779|The results of reciprocal collision tests showed that this was due to the existence of two separate axonal branches , one projecting to contralateral neocortex and one to contralateral neostriatum .
2822779|Intracellular staining of these neurons revealed ipsilateral axonal projections to the neostriatum and cortex .
2823991|We compared some functional responses of D1 - and D2-receptor stimulation in tissue slices of rat neostriatum with those in slices of the nucleus accumbens .
2823991|Only in the neostriatum , stimulation of D2-receptors inhibited the formation of cyclic AMP , brought about by forskolin or by D1-receptor stimulation .
2829995|Ultrastructural localization of beta-adrenergic receptor-like immunoreactivity in the cortex and neostriatum of rat brain .
2829995|We sought to quantitatively examine the processes containing beta-adrenergic receptor-like immunoreactivity -LRB- beta-AR-LI -RRB- in the cerebral cortex and neostriatum using a previously characterized rabbit antiserum to frog erythrocyte beta-ARs under optimized immunolabeling conditions .
2829995|In the neostriatum , the density of autoradiographic immunoreactivity was equivalent to the heavily labeled laminae of the cerebral cortex .
2829995|The neostriatum , whose major catecholaminergic innervation is dopaminergic , and not noradrenergic , is also confirmed to exhibit high levels of beta-AR-LI within subcellular structures analogous to those seen in the cerebral cortex .
2830947|Autoradiographic data indicate that mu - and kappa-receptors appear early in the development of several brain regions , including the neostriatum , olfactory tubercle and rostral midbrain , and later in other regions such as the thalamus and hypothalamus .

2846794|The dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices project to adjacent , longitudinal domains of the neostriatum , as has been described previously -LRB- Selemon and Goldman-Rakic , 1985 -RRB- ; these projections are also found in close apposition in the claustrum , the amygdala , the caudomedial lobule , and throughout the anterior medial , medial dorsal , lateral dorsal , and medial pulvinar nuclei of the thalamus .
2850075|In the telencephalon the highest concentration of specific binding was found in the hyperstriatum ventrale followed by the neostriatum , and then the lobus parolfactorius of the paleostriatal complex , whilst in the diencephalon highest levels of labelling were present in the infundibulum .

2855215|The effect of systemically administered delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol -LRB- THC -RRB- , the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana , on the potassium-evoked release of dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- was examined in the neostriatum of the chloral hydrate anesthetized rat .
2857778|Efferent synaptic connections of grafted dopaminergic neurons reinnervating the host neostriatum : a tyrosine hydroxylase immunocytochemical study .
2857778|In adult rats with a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-induced destruction of the nigrostriatal dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- pathway , grafts of embryonic substantia nigra can establish a new dopaminergic terminal fiber plexus in the previously denervated neostriatum and compensate for some of the behavioral deficits induced by the nigrostriatal lesion .
2857778|TH-immunoreactive axons from the graft were seen to make abundant symmetric synapses with neuronal elements in the host neostriatum .

2862950|Intraperitoneal administration of L-methioninesulfoximine -LRB- MSO -RRB- , an inhibitor of glutamine synthetase , induced different changes in amino acid concentration in the rostral neostriatum on the intact and decorticated sides .
2863790|The effect of methionine-enkephalin -LRB- Met-Enk -RRB- on responses of rat brain neostriatum neurones to microiontophoretic application of glutamate was studied in experiments with extracellular recording of spike activity .
2864108|Iontophoresis -LRB- 20-80 nA -RRB- of ascorbic acid -LRB- AA -RRB- accelerated the firing rate of approximately one-third of the neurons tested in the anteromedial neostriatum of anesthetized rats .
2864108|It is concluded that endogenous AA may modulate neuronal activity in the neostriatum .
2864704|The d-amphetamine 2 mg/kg pretreatment induced both an increased locomotion , thought to reflect an increased dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens , and weak stereotypies , thought to reflect an increased dopamine transmission in the neostriatum .
2864704|The findings support the notion that the common site of action for anti-psychotic drugs is blockade of dopamine receptors outside the neostriatum while the blockade of dopamine receptors within the striatum probably are related to the propensity of these drugs to induce the extrapyramidal side effects .
2866453|The influence of microionophoretically applied dopamine and dibutyril cAMP on the background and glutamate-evoked spike activity of neostriatum neurons was studied in acute experiments on rats immobilized by d-tubocurarine .
2866453|It was shown that dibutyril cAMP imitated the inhibiting dopamine effect on the background and glutamate-evoked spike activity of neostriatum neurons rather than the stimulating effect .

2872938|The muscarinic cholinergic agonist bethanechol -LRB- 0.25-1 .0 micrograms -RRB- injected bilaterally into various parts of the rat neostriatum induced a tonic electromyogram -LRB- EMG -RRB- activity in the gastrocnemius muscle which is considered to be a measure of limb rigidity .
2872938|Tonic EMG activity of comparable amount was observed after injections of bethanechol -LRB- 1.0 microgram -RRB- into all regions of the neostriatum but not into the globus pallidus , thalamus , zona incerta or cortex .
2873054|The serotoninergic mechanisms of neostriatum were found to be involved into the suppressive effects of droperidol , fluphenazine , haloperidol , thioridazine but not those of trifluoperazine , clozapine and aminazine on the midbrain ventral tegmentum self-stimulation .
2873054|The glutamatergic mechanisms of neostriatum and nucleus accumbens septi play a minor role in attenuation of tegmental self-stimulation with droperidol , fluphenazine , trifluoperazine and clozapine but these mechanisms seem to be responsible for the suppression of `` reward '' phenomenon with haloperidol , thioridazine and aminazine .

2879890|Engelsen BA , Fosse VM , Fonnum F. Unilateral frontal cortex ablations were performed in rats so that the glutamate terminals in the ipsilateral rostral neostriatum were removed .
2879890|At 1 or 7 days later , intraperitoneal injections of ammonium acetate induced different changes in amino acid concentrations in the intact and deafferentated neostriatum .
2879890|The concentration of alanine increased most in the intact neostriatum , whereas glutamine levels increased and aspartate levels decreased to the same extent on both sides in nonconvulsing and convulsing rats .
2880600|Any of these three agents induced amnesia when injected into the left -LRB- but not the right -RRB- medial hyperstriatum ventrale or into the right -LRB- but not the left -RRB- lateral neostriatum ; so it appears that both structures are required for formation of memory .
288082|Morphine -LRB- 1.67 , 5 , and 15 mg/kg of body weight , intraperitoneally -RRB- altered dopamine turnover as measured by the alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine method in the median eminence , neostriatum , and frontal cortex of male Sprague-Dawley rats .
288082|The turnover rate of dopamine was reduced in the median eminence and frontal cortex but accelerated in the neostriatum .

2889517|The competition curves were compared with those obtained with preparations from the neostriatum .
2889517|The results demonstrate that specific -LSB- 3H -RSB- SCH23390 binding in the cerebral cortex has the same pharmacological profile as in the neostriatum , so that this radioligand can be used to label dopamine D1 receptors in brain regions with a sparse dopaminergic innervation .

2891023|These data indicate that the immature neostriatum is altered by even mild hypoxic insults presented during the time of neuronal proliferation and synaptogenesis .
2893817|The binding of the lectin peanut agglutinin , which has an affinity for galactosyl B-1 ,3 N-acetylgalactosamine residues , was compared to acetylcholinesterase staining and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the immature and adult neostriatum .
2893817|The binding of peanut agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase , in sections that were processed for peroxidase histochemistry , was extremely pronounced in the neostriatum through the first postnatal week and constituted ringlike or polygonally shaped structures , which , overall , produced a variegated mosaic .
2893986|Fifteen min after subcutaneous injection of MDMA -LRB- 10 mg/kg -RRB- , the enzymatic activity of tryptophan hydroxylase -LRB- the rate-limiting enzyme for the biosynthesis of serotonin -RRB- was significantly decreased in the frontal cortex ; by 1 hr after the injection , the activity of tryptophan hydroxylase had significantly declined in the neostriatum , hippocampus and hypothalamus as well .

2930632|These findings are consistent with previous reports of post-training memory facilitation mediated by dopaminergic function in the neostriatum .

2998546|In order to investigate the role of neostriatal dopamine receptors in muscular rigidity we have studied catalepsy and spontaneous muscle tone in rats receiving haloperidol injections into various parts of the neostriatum .
2998546|It was found that low doses of haloperidol -LRB- 250-750 ng/0 .5 microliter -RRB- induced a tonic activity in the EMG of the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle when injected into the most rostral part of the neostriatum -LRB- A 8620-9650 -RRB- .
2998546|No muscular rigidity could be observed when haloperidol -LRB- 500 ng/0 .5 microliter -RRB- was injected further caudally into the neostriatum or into the medial part of the nucleus accumbens .
2998546|Thus catalepsy and muscular rigidity were found to be closely related phenomena within the neostriatum .
2998546|Finally , it is discussed how information relevant to tonic EMG activity is transmitted from the substantia nigra pars compacta to the superior colliculus and the ventromedial thalamus via the neostriatum and the substrate nigra pars reticulata .
2999631|The effect of lesions in the parts of medial hyperstriatum ventrale -LRB- MHV -RRB- or lateral neostriatum -LRB- LN -RRB- on imprinting behavior was examined .
3000515|Stimulation of the neostriatum evoked two distinct types of inhibition which were dependent on GP neuronal firing patterns , a brief inhibition -LRB- about 75 ms -RRB- followed by resetting rhythmic neuronal activities and a relatively long-term inhibition -LRB- about 100 ms -RRB- .
3000515|These results suggest that dopamine may produce change in the firing patterns of GP neurons by either acting directly or attenuating GABAergic inhibitory transmission from the neostriatum .
3001593|It is suggested that partial deafferentation of the neostriatum in the dominant hemisphere , combined with enhanced cross-innervation of the contralateral system , led to a shift of cerebral dominance to the intact side .

3004646|A majority of HDC-like immunoreactive axonal varicosities observed in serial thin sections for electron microscopy exhibited no synaptic contacts in either the neostriatum or cerebral cortex .
3004649|Though 3 distinct cholinergic regions were investigated , cholinergic-specific effects could only be elicited from one region , suggesting that the neostriatum is heterogeneous in this respect .

3008024|Distinct sites of functional interaction between dopamine , acetylcholine and gamma-aminobutyrate within the neostriatum : an electromyographic study in rats .
3008024|In order to study the functional interaction between dopamine , acetylcholine and gamma-aminobutyrate within the rat neostriatum , we investigated the effect of intrastriatal injection of different drugs acting on these transmitter systems on muscle tone measured as tonic activity in the electromyogram of the gastrocnemius muscle .

3008024|These results point to the existence of : a functional interaction between dopamine and acetylcholine in the rostral neostriatum ; a functional interaction between acetylcholine and gamma-aminobutyrate in the intermediate neostriatum , and a functional flow of information from the rostral to the intermediate neostriatum .
3008920|Ipsilateral stimulation of AGm should excite all types of corticostriatal neurons projecting to neostriatal neurons in the corresponding area in neostriatum , while stimulation of the same cortical area on the side contralateral to the recording should evoke synaptic potentials from a more restricted subpopulation of crossed corticostriatal neurons .
3008920|Comparison with previous findings indicated that this earliest EPSP component was due to activation of fast-conducting descending cortical efferents with collateral projections exclusively to the ipsilateral neostriatum .
3008920|Stimulation of contralateral neostriatum evoked responses identical to those obtained using stimulation of contralateral neocortex .
3008920|Stimulation of the contralateral internal capsule just caudal to neostriatum was not effective in evoking the EPSP .
3008920|These observations indicate that contralaterally projecting corticostriatal neurons in the rat project bilaterally in neostriatum , have axonal branches to the contralateral cerebral cortex as well as neostriatum , and converge onto neostriatal neurons that also receive input from the corresponding cortical region on the ipsilateral side .

3142072|Quantitation of nerve terminal populations : synaptic vesicle-associated proteins as markers for synaptic density in the rat neostriatum .
3142072|This study has assessed the contributions of the corticostriatal fibers , the ascending striatopetal fibers , and the intrinsic neostriatal neurons to the nerve terminal population found in the rat neostriatum -LRB- caudatoputamen -RRB- .
3142072|For this purpose , we have analysed the levels of two different synaptic vesicle-associated proteins , synapsin I and protein p38 -LRB- also called synaptophysin -RRB- , in the neostriatum after specific lesions .
3142072|Our results indicate that 45-50 % of the synaptic vesicle proteins in the rat neostriatum derive from the corticostriatal fibers , that approximately 25-30 % of the synaptic vesicle proteins are present in kainic acid-sensitive structures , presumably intrinsic terminals and local collaterals , and that ascending fibers contain 20-25 % of the vesicle-associated proteins in the neostriatum .
3142072|These three neuronal populations therefore comprise 95-100 % of the synaptic vesicle-associated proteins in the rat neostriatum , and thus make up most of the nerve terminals in this brain region .
3144655|Pretreatment with the DA receptor antagonist , haloperidol , failed to prevent the decreases in the activity of tryptophan hydroxylase and the concentration of serotonin -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- in the frontal cortex , hippocampus and neostriatum 1 hr after a single administration of methamphetamine .
3145209|In another rat , sacrificed after 11 weeks , a sparse TH-positive fiber plexus was seen to extend into the adjacent host neostriatum .
3145209|Two rats sacrificed after 20 weeks both contained TH-positive neurons that gave rise to a rich fiber network throughout the entire host neostriatum , and this fiber network was also seen to extend into the globus pallidus and nucleus accumbens .
3145209|Twenty weeks after transplantation , abundant TH-positive synaptic contacts with host neurons were seen throughout the neostriatum , and such contacts were identified in the globus pallidus as well .
3149760|The principal densities of neurotensin-like neuronal perikarya were located in the limbic system , the basal ganglion and the cerebral cortex ; particularly in the amygdala , the septum , the neostriatum , the claustrum and the insula .

3166707|The neostriatum control cases showed only trivial threshold changes as a consequence of the surgery .
3167582|Although ATD treatment had no effect on estrogen receptors in hypothalamic-preoptic tissue , ATD-treated males had significantly higher levels of -LSB- 3H -RSB- estrogen binding in 3 vocal control nuclei : the dorsomedial portion of the intercollicular nucleus -LRB- DM -RRB- , the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- MAN -RRB- , and Area X. Low levels of estrogen binding were also detected in cytosol from the caudal portions of the ventral hyperstriatum -LRB- HVc -RRB- and the robust nucleus of the archistriatum -LRB- RA -RRB- of both untreated and ATD-treated castrates .

3209741|Of the song control nuclei , nucleus magnocellularis of the anterior neostriatum ; hyperstriatum ventralis , pars caudalis ; nucleus intercollicularis ; and nucleus hypoglossus were labelled .
3224645|Rats were chronically implanted with cannulae aimed at the nucleus accumbens or the neostriatum and with EMG electrodes in the triceps or the gastrocnemius soleus muscle .
3224645|The results show that haloperidol induced an increase in triceps muscle tone when injected into the nucleus accumbens but not when injected into the neostriatum .
3224645|Likewise it was found that haloperidol induced an increase in gastrocnemius soleus muscle tone when injected into the neostriatum but not when injected into the nucleus accumbens .
3224645|The present data show that in addition to the cortex , subcortical structures also appear to possess a certain topography , with forelimb rigidity being mediated , at least in part , by the nucleus accumbens , and hindlimb rigidity , at least in part by the neostriatum .
3233481|These nuclei are called field ` L' and neostriatum intermedium pars dorsolateralis -LRB- NIDL -RRB- .
3233481|The results show that neurons in both fields project laterally to a portion of the neostriatum intermedium pars ventrolateralis -LRB- NIVL -RRB- and rostrally to the rostromedial archistriatum .
3235068|In both sexes tamoxifen increased the somatic areas of neurons in RA -LRB- robust nucleus of the archistriatum -RRB- , HVc -LRB- caudal nucleus of the ventral hyperstriatum -RRB- , and MAN -LRB- magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -RRB- .
3241638|By means of Cresyl violet stainings and immunocytochemical studies on prolactin - , luteinizing hormone -LRB- LH -RRB- - , and adrenocorticotropin -LRB- ACTH -RRB- - like immunoreactivities evidence has been obtained that homologous adenohypophyseal transplants survive for many weeks in the rat neostriatum .
3241638|Gland cells maintain their endocrine properties and appear to secrete prolactin but not ACTH and LH into the surrounding neuropil of the rat neostriatum , since it contains a strong diffuse prolactin-like immunoreactivity .

3259295|The syndrome is associated with degeneration of the dopamine-containing neurons in the substantia nigra , many of which project to the neostriatum .
3260481|These results are compatible with functionally impaired interactions between frontal/parietal regions and the neostriatum and thalamus , regions that subserve directed attention .
3267344|These three areas were transplanted to the motor cortex , neostriatum or hippocampus of adult animals .
3267344|Finally , laminin injection to the hippocampus , motor cortex or neostriatum of the adult brain did not stimulate sprouting of undamaged adult 5-HT or NE fibers .
3269253|The data obtained from the cerebellum and neostriatum , in particular , suggest that chronic , moderate perinatal CO exposure may disrupt neuronal proliferation and , perhaps , may disrupt certain markers for neurochemical transmission .
3281983|The postsynaptic targets of cholinergic boutons in the rat neostriatum were assessed by examination in the electron microscope of boutons that were immunoreactive for choline acetyltransferase , the synthetic enzyme for acetylcholine .
3281983|Of 209 immunoreactive synaptic boutons observed in random searches of the neostriatum , 45 % made contact with dendritic shafts , 34 % with dendritic spines , and 20 % with neuronal perikarya .
3281983|It is concluded that cholinergic boutons in the neostriatum form synaptic specializations and that one of their major targets is the medium-size densely spiny neuron that projects to the substantia nigra .
3284272|Occlusion of MCA in the rat causes a pronounced decline of flow in the neostriatum to less than 10 % of normal .
3284426|In other instances , as in animals with DA-rich grafts reinnervating the neostriatum , we believe that the available data provide quite substantial evidence that the behavioral recovery is caused by the ability of the grafted neurons to reinnervate relevant parts of the host brain .
3294933|Our fine structural study provides evidence that cholinergic neurons in the MSDB are similar to cholinergic neurons in the basal nucleus and neostriatum , which have been described by other investigators .
3295120|Lesioning of the corticostriatal pathway by frontal cortical ablation caused decreases in the striatal levels of aspartate -LRB- -28 % -RRB- and glutamate -LRB- -18 % -RRB- , an increase in striatal glutamine level -LRB- 45 % -RRB- , and decreased high-affinity uptake of D - -LSB- 3H -RSB- aspartate -LRB- -27 % -RRB- in the lesioned dorsal neostriatum .
3300850|The physiological recordings generally confirmed the findings of Delius and Bennetto -LRB- Brain Research , 37 -LRB- 1972 -RRB- 205-221 -RRB- of somatosensory sites within the dorsal thalamus , anterior hyperstriatum and caudomedial neostriatum , and the anatomical results show that the thalamic cells of origin of the projections to the two telencephalic regions are largely separate : a rostral cell group comprising nucleus dorsalis intermedius ventralis anterior projects to the anterior hyperstriatum accessorium -LRB- HA -RRB- , whilst a caudal cell group comprising caudal regions of nucleus dorsolateralis posterior -LRB- DLP -RRB- projects to the medial neostriatum intermedium and caudale -LRB- NI/NC -RRB- .
3300860|The morphogenesis of glutamic acid decarboxylase in the neostriatum of the cat : neuronal and ultrastructural localization .
3300860|Correlative light and electron microscopic immunohistochemical methods were adapted for a descriptive analysis of the normal time course and pattern of expression and intraneuronal localization of the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase -LRB- GAD -RRB- in the neostriatum -LRB- Ns -RRB- of fetal , postnatal and adult cats .
3302125|These included several forebrain regions , such as the superficial layers of the rostral neocortex , dorsal neostriatum , nucleus accumbens , septohippocampal nucleus , intralaminar thalamic nuclei , and external capsules .
3320818|The time course for recovery of binding of the D1 dopamine receptor antagonist radioligand -LSB- 3H -RSB- SCH 23390 , after administration of the irreversible antagonist N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1 ,2 - dihydroquinoline -LRB- EEDQ -RRB- , was studied in the neostriatum , nucleus accumbens , tuberculum olfactorium and claustrum of the rat by means of quantitative receptor autoradiography .
3335843|DARPP-32 -LRB- dopamine - and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein of Mr = 32,000 -RRB- and phosphatase inhibitor-1 , two previously characterized inhibitors of protein phosphatase-1 , were identified in both the neostriatum and the substantia nigra .
3335843|The neuronal localization of DARPP-32 and phosphatase inhibitor-1 within the rat neostriatum and substantia nigra was investigated by studying the effects of kainic acid .
3335843|Injection into the neostriatum of kainic acid , which destroys striatonigral neurons and striatonigral fibers , decreased the amounts of DARPP-32 and phosphatase inhibitor-1 to the same extent , both in the lesioned neostriatum and in the ipsilateral substantia nigra .
3335843|The specific activity of protein phosphatase-1 in the neostriatum was unaffected by kainic acid .
3335843|In contrast , protein phosphatase-1 does not appear to be enriched in any specific neuronal subpopulation in the neostriatum .
3339100|Cerebral blood flow measured with -LSB- 14C -RSB- iodoantipyrine was severely reduced in the lateral portion of neostriatum .
3339100|The adjacent cortex was perfused at one-third of normal , whereas blood flow in the medial neostriatum was only slightly reduced .
3340078|In contrast , chronic morphine treatment did not alter protein kinase activity in several other brain regions studied , including the neostriatum , frontal cortex , and dorsal raphe .
3344092|Eleven days later , experimental animals and their sham-operated littermate controls were killed and pieces of frontoparietal cortex , neostriatum , cerebellar vermis , and brain stem were processed for high performance liquid chromatography .
3344092|Grossly , the lateral ventricles were extremely enlarged , the cerebral cortex was thinned , the neostriatum was compressed , and portions of the tectum and cerebellum were vacuolated .
3344092|Decreases in norepinephrine -LRB- 71 % -RRB- , dopamine -LRB- 73 % -RRB- , and serotonin -LRB- 50 % -RRB- were observed in the cerebral cortex , neostriatum , and cerebellum , respectively .
3346370|Identification of synaptic terminals of thalamic or cortical origin in contact with distinct medium-size spiny neurons in the rat neostriatum .
3346370|The area of the central neostriatum that receives input from both the parafascicular nucleus of the thalamus and the somatosensory cortex was identified by retrograde transport of a conjugate of horseradish peroxidase and wheat germ agglutinin -LRB- HRP-WGA -RRB- .
3346370|The same region of the neostriatum was studied in rats that had received multiple electrolytic lesions in the somatosensory cortex and also an injection of HRP-WGA in different parts of the parafascicular nucleus .
3346370|Sections of this part of the neostriatum were impregnated by the single-section Golgi procedure after revealing anterogradely transported HRP-WGA .
3346370|An independent confirmation that the targets of thalamostriatal neurons originating in the parafascicular nucleus are dendritic shafts was provided by studying the boutons labelled following electrolytic lesioning or injection of the lectin Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin -LRB- PHA-L -RRB- into this nucleus : these boutons were also found to form asymmetric synaptic contacts with dendritic shafts within the neostriatum .
3346370|It is concluded that although afferents from the somatosensory cortex and from the parafascicular nucleus converge upon the same part of the neostriatum , they probably do not converge upon the same spiny neurons .
3346727|Recent anatomical investigations of the mammalian neostriatum have uncovered discrete neurochemical zones characterized by low levels of AChE and high levels of enkephalin-like immunoreactivity -LRB- ELI -RRB- compared with the surrounding neostriatal tissue .
3347374|Rostrally , cholinergic neurons were seen within the neostriatum , medial septal nucleus -LRB- Ch1 -RRB- , ventral -LRB- Ch2 -RRB- and horizontal -LRB- Ch3 -RRB- limb nuclei and nucleus basalis-substantia innominata complex -LRB- Ch4 -RRB- .
3357012|Behavioral and biochemical studies have suggested that fetal striatal grafts in the adult rat neostriatum can reverse deficits induced by excitotoxic lesions of the host caudate tissue .
3357012|Compared to host neostriatum , the grafts at the light-microscopic level lacked bundles of myelinated axons and had neurons that were tightly packed in clusters and rich in Nissl substance .
3357012|At the electron-microscopic level , grafts 2 weeks following implantation contained many features seen in the normally developing neostriatum , such as growth cones , immature synapses , and degenerating profiles .
3357012|The lengths of the synaptic junctions in the grafts were the same as those in the neostriatum .
3359246|This increase was site specific as it did not occur in control non-target areas , neostriatum intermediale and hyperstriatum ventrale -LRB- VN -RRB- .
3362934|These results indicate that the neostriatum of the rat is not an homogeneous structure concerning the expression of rotational behavior after DA receptor stimulation .
3366794|Administered by this route the THIP is distributed to the neocortex and neostriatum .
3370442|In three breeds of domestic pigeons -LRB- fantails , homing pigeons , and strassers -RRB- the volumes of fresh , i.e. unfixed tissue of 14 brain structures were determined -LRB- telencephalon , diencephalon , nervus opticus , tectum , cerebellum , tegmentum and hyperstriatum accessorium , hyperstriatum ventrale , neostriatum , paleostriatum , hippocampus , septum , regio praepiriformis , bulbus olfactorius -RRB- .
3370442|The tectum , hippocampus , paleostriatum and especially the neostriatum and olfactory bulb are remarkably larger in homing pigeons .
3371250|It can be suggested that the neural circuits involving frontal lobes and parts of the neostriatum and of the pallidum are implicated in the mechanisms of these three types of psychoses .
3376565|Main parameters were studied of the acoustic evoked potentials -LRB- EPs -RRB- from L field of the caudal neostriatum of altricial nestlings of 2-8 days to pure tones in the range of species-specific signals .
3376758|Serotonin reduction in the mouse neostriatum during hyperthermia-induced convulsions studied by immunohistochemistry .
3376758|A significant reduction in serotonin immunoreactivity was observed in the neostriatum -LRB- caudate-putamen complex -RRB- of the mice which had hyperthermia-induced seizures , while the serotonin immunoreactivity remained unchanged in the neocortex and paleostriatum .
3376758|These results suggest that serotonin may be an important mediator in the mechanism of hyperthermia-induced convulsions or that the susceptibility of serotonin neurons to a convulsive state is greatest in the neostriatum .
3379156|GABAergic elements in the neuronal circuits of the monkey neostriatum : a light and electron microscopic immunocytochemical study .
3379156|An antibody raised in rabbits against a GABA-BSA conjugate was used together with the PAP technique to label elements in the neostriatum of three Old World monkeys .

3380301|This study investigated the functional capacity of intrastriatal grafts of embryonic striatal tissue in rats with unilateral ibotenic acid lesions of the neostriatum .
3382965|-LSB- 3H -RSB- - QNB binding was highest in cerebral cortex , neostriatum and hippocampus .
3384045|Haloperidol -LRB- 2.5 micrograms/0 .5 microliter -RRB- locally injected into the medial prefrontal cortex or into the rostral part of the neostriatum resulted in the development of catalepsy as measured in the bar test .
3384045|In contrast , injections of haloperidol into the nucleus accumbens , more caudal parts of the neostriatum , anterior cingulate cortex , rostral and lateral parts of the prefrontal cortex and into the lateral ventricles failed to induce catalepsy .
3384045|It is concluded that blockade of dopamine receptors located in the rostral neostriatum and in the medial prefrontal cortex contributes to the development of haloperidol induced catalepsy .
3390703|Glutamate decarboxylase immunoreactive neurons in rat neostriatum : their morphological types and populations .
3390703|Morphological types and populations of glutamate decarboxylase -LRB- GAD -RRB- - immunoreactive neurons in rat neostriatum -LRB- Str -RRB- were studied .
3395451|In two experiments , pigeons with bilateral lesions of the hyperstriatum were compared with unoperated control birds and operated control subjects having bilateral lesions of the neostriatum on tasks designed to test two hypotheses of hyperstriatal function .
3396712|Administration of 1 mkg of carbocholine into the neostriatum led to a general depression of the behaviour whereas 0.1 mkg exerted no effect .
3396712|Contralateral administration of the same dose into the neostriatum altered the main component of the posture readjustment .
3408448|These areas , the hyperstriatum accessorium-dorsale -LRB- HAD -RRB- , a part of the medial neo-hyperstriatum -LRB- MNH -RRB- , the lateral neo-hyperstriatum -LRB- LNH -RRB- , and a portion of the caudal archi-neostriatum -LRB- ANC -RRB- , show enhanced 2 - -LSB- 14C -RSB- deoxyglucose -LRB- 2-DG -RRB- uptake according to the experimental situation .
3409019|Effect of bilateral decortication on nerve growth factor content in basal nucleus and neostriatum of adult rat brain .
3409019|The content of nerve growth factor -LRB- NGF -RRB- was measured by a sensitive two-site enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the basal nucleus and neostriatum at various times following bilateral suction lesions of the cerebral neocortex in adult rats .
3409019|In addition , 29 days after cortical lesions , NGF content in the neostriatum was increased 145 % above controls .
3409019|Thus , enhanced NGF production occurs in both basal nucleus and neostriatum of adult rats in response to antero - and/or retrograde neuronal degeneration .
3411349|The long processes of these radial glia showed a mediolateral orientation , and were much more abundant in some parts of the telencephalon -LRB- e.g. , hyperstriatum , caudal neostriatum , and lobus parolfactorius -RRB- than in others -LRB- e.g. , anterior neostriatum , archistriatum , and septum -RRB- , which had few or no radial glia fibers .
3411358|In contrast to HVc and Area X , sex differences in neuron number in the robustus nucleus of the archistriatum -LRB- RA -RRB- and the magnocellular nucleus of the neostriatum -LRB- MAN -RRB- emerge because males retain neurons that are lost in females between 20 and 55 d of age .
3416184|The size of neostriatum , and the number of putatively cholinergic AChE-positive perikarya , are significantly reduced in two-year-old rats .
3416184|Consequently , mean cell density is decreased in the striatal complex by 15.58 % ; age-dependent loss is more pronounced : -LRB- 1 -RRB- in the dorsal and lateral parts of neostriatum , which in adults have a higher neural density ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- in the ventromedial part , which in the aged becomes almost void of neurones .
3416184|It is concluded that depletion of cholinergic perikarya is a specific feature of natural ageing , which affects diffusely the neostriatum , and particularly its ventromedial territories .
3426789|In four experiments , pigeons with bilateral lesions of the hippocampus were compared to unoperated control birds and operated control subjects that received bilateral lesions of the neostriatum on tasks sensitive to hippocampal damage in mammals .
3427410|Efferents were found in the symmetrical area of the contralateral cortex , in the paleocortex and neostriatum bilaterally , the ipsilateral anteromediodorsal region of the thalamus , the hypothalamus , the ventral tegmental area , and the pons .
3427410|The innervation of the cortex was columnar and that of the neostriatum patchy , as was previously demonstrated for comparable projections in placental mammals .
3427424|Cell suspensions of embryonic neostriatum were transplanted into the adult rat neostriatum lesioned previously by kainic acid .
3427424|After 1-2 months , injections of horseradish peroxidase conjugated with wheat germ agglutinin -LRB- HRP -RRB- were made either within the graft , into adjacent host neostriatum or the host ventral midbrain .

Synaptic interactions between striatal projection neurons and axon terminals containing immunoreactive glutamic acid decarboxylase -LRB- GAD -RRB- or Leu-enkephalin were examined in the rat neostriatum using a combined method of horseradish peroxidase retrograde transport from the substantia nigra and immunohistochemistry at the electron microscopic level .

3555508|This method gave a GABA turnover of 54.3 + / - 4.8 nmole/mg protein/hr in neostriatum .

3561765|Thalamic projections to the paleostriatum and neostriatum in the pigeon have been studied using wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase in anterograde and retrograde tracing experiments .
3561765|Injections centred on different mediolateral regions of the dorsal thalamus produced terminal labelling in correspondingly different mediolateral regions of the striatal complex , comprising paleostriatum augmentation and lobus parolfactorius , within the ventral paleostriatum , and within the neostriatum .
3567618|A mosaic-like distribution of dopamine receptors in rat neostriatum and its relationship to striosomes .

3584552|Dissociated suspensions of tissue taken from the striatal ridge of embryos at 14 days of gestation were transplanted into the neostriatum of adult rats 5 days after intrastriatal kainic acid lesions .
3584552|One type resembled the large intensely reactive AChE neuron that is thought to be a cholinergic interneuron of the normal neostriatum .
3584552|The other type resembled smaller , less reactive AChE neurons of the neostriatum , as well as medium-sized , lightly reactive AChE neurons of the globus pallidus .
3584552|Qualitative observations suggest that these less reactive AChE neurons were more numerous in transplants compared to the normal neostriatum .
3584552|Dark areas of AChE neuropil similar in intensity to the normal neostriatum were found between larger areas of lighter AChE neuropil .
3584563|Corresponding to this dimorphism in hormone sensitivity , two song-related neural regions , magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- MAN -RRB- and hyperstriatum ventralis pars caudalis -LRB- HVc -RRB- , have more cells that accumulate androgens in males than in females .
358779|Studies on the interactions between the substantia nigra and the neostriatum .
3593413|Inhalation of soman also induced a substantial inhibition of the AChE-activity in the lung -LRB- 86 % -RRB- , but somewhat smaller inhibition in the hippocampus -LRB- 70 % -RRB- and almost no inhibition in the neostriatum -LRB- 19 % -RRB- .
3600615|The potency with which carbamoylcholine enhances phosphoinositide -LRB- PPI -RRB- hydrolysis in different brain regions -LRB- neostriatum , cerebral cortex , and hippocampus -RRB- and in two neuroblastomas -LRB- the murine N1E-115 and human SK-N-SH -RRB- differs by 10 - to 20-fold .
3600615|In contrast , in both the neostriatum and SK-N-SH cells , PrBCM treatment resulted in a greater loss of mAChR number than of stimulated inositol phosphate release , and dose response curves for carbamoylcholine were shifted to higher agonist concentrations .
3600615|The two groups of tissues also differ in their sensitivity to pirenzepine , which is a markedly weaker antagonist of stimulated PPI hydrolysis in SK-N-SH cells and neostriatum -LRB- Ki 160-250 nM -RRB- , than in the cerebral cortex , hippocampus , and N1E-115 cells -LRB- Ki 10-20 nM -RRB- .
3601061|Astroglial response in the excitotoxically lesioned neostriatum and its projection areas in the rat .
3601061|The anatomical distribution of the astrocytic glial reactions , following ibotenic acid-induced neuronal degeneration of the neostriatum in the rat , has been studied immunohistochemically using an antibody directed against the astrocytic marker , glial fibrillary acidic protein .
3601061|Total doses of 16-20 micrograms ibotenic acid injected unilaterally into the head of the neostriatum caused not only a marked neuronal cell loss but was also accompanied by a large increase in the number and size -LRB- about 5 times -RRB- of glial fibrillary acidic protein-stained astrocytes throughout the neostriatum by 7 days after lesion .
3601061|In animals that received a larger dose of ibotenic acid into the neostriatum -LRB- 25 micrograms -RRB- , neuronal cell loss was also observed in the neocortex and reactive glial fibrillary acidic-stained astrocytes were found in the entire neocortex of the injected hemisphere .
3601061|In the chronic group , 6 months after the excitotoxic lesion , the astroglial response was clearly diminished or absent in the major neostriatal projection areas , but was still present within the lesioned neostriatum .
3601075|On the projections from the neostriatum to the cerebral cortex : the `` displaced '' neurons .
3601075|The entire dorsal and lateral cortex of one cerebral hemisphere of rats was infiltrated with different fluorescent tracers and the neostriatum was examined for labelled perikarya .
3601075|In spite of the extensive infiltration of the cortex , such neurons were seen only sporadically in the ipsilateral neostriatum and almost only in the vicinity of the globus pallidus and the subcortical white matter .
3601075|The size and shape of these neurons , and particularly their proximity to some cell groups which surround the neostriatum and project to the cerebral cortex , suggest that these neurons belong to the neighbouring structures such as the magnocellular nuclei of the basal forebrain , the claustrum and the VIb cortical layer .
3607428|Selective involvement of large neurons in the neostriatum of Alzheimer 's disease and senile dementia : a morphometric investigation .
3607428|In order to evaluate the quantitative changes in the neostriatum of Alzheimer type -LRB- SDAT -RRB- , sections of the caudate head -LRB- CN -RRB- and putamen -LRB- PT -RRB- from 4 AD/SDAT and 6 age-matched control cases were stained with Klver-Barrera , and the cell body and nuclear areas of the neurons were measured by a digitizer .
3610851|Regional changes in the polarity of each component suggest that auditory neurons in the medulla project directly to the nucleus basalis , which in turn projects to the frontal neostriatum .
3612246|Subcortically , the rCMRO2 increased in neostriatum and posterior thalamus .
36207|Alteration in tyrosine hydroxylase , glutamic acid decarboxylase and choline acetyltransferase in basal ganglia following herpes simplex virus inoculation in rat neostriatum .
3620984|Three patterns of development emerged : ACh increased rapidly , overshot and returned to the adult level in midbrain-medulla-pons and cerebellum , ACh increased linearly to adult level in neostriatum and olfactory bulb and ACh increased linearly to a plateau and then increased to the adult level in the remaining regions .
3620993|Our results show that -LSB- 3H -RSB- HCh3 binding sites in the newborn baboon and fetal human neostriatum are localized to patches , and then adopt a ` striosome-like ' distribution in the juvenile baboon brain .
3620993|These findings indicate a reorganization of -LSB- 3H -RSB- HCh3 binding site distribution during the ontogeny of the primate neostriatum .
3625274|Neurons that were identified as dopaminergic by a variety of electrophysiological criteria , including antidromic activation from ipsilateral neostriatum or globus pallidus , were microiontophoretically injected with horseradish peroxidase and examined at the level of the light microscope .
3664262|The results indicate that in this species the thalamic auditory relay nucleus , n. ovoidalis , projects upon a circumscribed region of the caudal and caudomedial neostriatum including field ` L' and immediately adjacent portions of the neostriatum intermedium , pars dorsolateralis -LRB- NIDL -RRB- .
3664262|The caudal and intermediate levels of the neostriatum intermedium apparently serve as a complex processing area for many thalamic inputs in this species .
3666014|Apomorphine decreases stimulated dopamine release in rat nucleus accumbens but not in neostriatum : in vivo voltammetric data .
3668522|Concentrations of noradrenaline and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid -LRB- 5-HIAA -RRB- were decreased in the cerebral cortex and frontal cortex , concentration of 5-HIAA was decreased in the neostriatum , and concentrations of noradrenaline , 5-hydroxytryptamine -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- and 5-HIAA were elevated in the lower brain stem .
3692272|However , as shown by morphometry , the size of neostriatum in hybrids was larger than that of both parental strains , and the density of striatal cholinergic neurones was significantly lower than that of DBA/2 mice , being close to that of the C57BL/6 strain .
3693107|A quantitative histological study of the indusium griseum and neostriatum in elderly mice .
3693107|In contrast the number of glia per 100 neurons in the neostriatum fell between 25 and 28 months .
3693107|Unlike the indusium griseum , in which there was a significant variation in the mitotic and pyknotic indices with age , the neostriatum showed no variation in the mitotic and pyknotic indices between 6 and 31 months .
3693107|The mitotic index was always lower in the neostriatum .
3693893|A morphological study of the neostriatum of aged mice with particular reference to neuroglia .
3693893|The most prominent feature of the aged mouse neostriatum is the presence of large vacuoles .
3693893|Careful inspection showed that these are vacuolated myelin sheaths and are invariably found in , or at the periphery of , the nerve fibre bundles which traverse the neostriatum .
36962|Monoamine levels and synthesis rates in amygdala , hippocampus , neostriatum , thalamus and brain stem are generally similar to comparable measures previously reported in a variety of species .

3703249|The genesis of the medium-sized neurons of the neostriatum extends from day 12 to at least postnatal day 2 .
3703249|At the level of the caudal neostriatum , the neurons display a clear mediolateral spatiotemporal gradient .
3703249|On the other hand , in the body of the neostriatum , clusters of isochronically generated neurons are obvious .
3703249|The large chromophilic neurons of the neostriatum appear exclusively during the early period .
3703251|In the present study we have investigated the relative rostrocaudal position of the neurons in the substantia nigra , which project to the ipsilateral or contralateral neostriatum .
3703252|Since the medial geniculate nucleus projects , in addition to auditory cortex , to a striatal field , involving portions of the posterior neostriatum and underlying archistriatum -LRB- amygdala -RRB- , we have sought to determine whether interruption of connections linking the medial geniculate nucleus to this subcortical field also disrupts conditioning .
3703252|Control groups included animals with unilateral lesion of the medial geniculate nucleus , with unilateral lesion of the medial geniculate nucleus combined with lesion of the ipsilateral striatal field , unilateral lesion of the medial geniculate combined with lesion of the contralateral anterior neostriatum -LRB- a striatal area outside of the medial geniculate nucleus projection field -RRB- .
3711991|DARPP-32 was present in neostriatum from all six mammalian species tested -LRB- mouse , rat , guinea pig , rabbit , cow , and rhesus monkey -RRB- at concentrations of from 96 to 144 pmol/mg total protein , which constituted from 0.22 to 0.32 % of the total protein .
3730856|The increase was very small in control non-target areas , neostriatum intermediale + hyperstriatum ventrale -LRB- VN -RRB- , of either sex .
3732474|A total volume of 1 microliter kainic acid -LRB- 3 nM -RRB- was injected unilaterally into the neostriatum of adult rats .
3732474|Sections stained for Nissl substance revealed that kainic acid damaged as much as three-quarters of the neostriatum .
3733902|On the other hand , similarly hypoxic fetuses , if they experience reductions in MABP below 30 mm Hg , develop foci of necrosis that predominantly affect hemispheric white matter and neostriatum .
3743814|-LSB- Reactions of neurons of the neostriatum to acoustic stimuli with different localizations -RSB- .
3745517|Similar injections of DLPr labeled a contiguous , but more rostral , region of the neostriatum intermedium .
3745517|Injections of horseradish peroxidase at various locations in the neostriatal DLP terminal field demonstrated a rostrocaudal ordering of the DLP projection upon the neostriatum intermedium .
3751303|It is suggested that the cause of the dissociation consists in different sensitivity to amphetamine of the dorsal and ventral parts of the neostriatum which are differently involved in organization of stereotype movements and EEG disturbances in amphetamine stereotypy .
3755764|One library represents RNA species from the cerebellar cortex , the other from the neostriatum .
3758264|Substantia nigra stimulation evoked antidromic responses in rat neostriatum .
3758264|Electrical stimulation of the substantia nigra of rats elicits a burst of small amplitude waves with a latency of 4-6 ms that may last for 10-15 ms throughout much of the neostriatum .
3758264|Single substantia nigra evoked action potentials were recorded in neostriatum with a mean latency of 9.8 ms , ranging from 4-22 ms. These action potentials were considered to be antidromic because they were occluded during appropriate collision intervals by orthodromic action potentials elicited by frontal cortex stimulation .
3768136|This pathway passes from the optic tectum to nucleus dorsolateralis posterior thalami and then to the neostriatum intermedium , including the medial ectostriatum .

3768683|Fukui K , Kariyama H , Kashiba A , Kato N , Kimura H. Heterogeneity of adult rat neostriatum has been studied by fluorescence histochemistry .
3779385|Unilateral , intranigral infusions of amphetamine produce differential , bilateral changes in unit activity and extracellular levels of ascorbate in the neostriatum of the rat .
3779385|Simultaneous recordings of single-unit activity and oxidation current were obtained bilaterally from the neostriatum of rats in response to a unilateral infusion of D-amphetamine -LRB- 2.0 microliters of 10 micrograms/microliter -RRB- into the substantia nigra .
3779810|These hippocampal neurons were very similar to ChAT-immunoreactive cells in the neocortex of the same animals but were quite different from cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain , medial septal nucleus , and neostriatum , which were larger and more intensely immunostained .
3786109|It is concluded that the muscarinic effect of ACh in the neostriatum is to modulate Ca-influx and that this effect is exerted in a tonic manner .
3793387|The histochemical reactivity of the enzyme NADH2-tetrazolium reductase -LRB- NADHR -RRB- at the level of frontal and occipital cortex , neostriatum and hippocampus was remarkably reduced .
3793387|On the contrary , acetylcholinesterase -LRB- AChE -RRB- reactivity was increased in all the investigated brain areas with the sole exception of the neostriatum .
37984|Morphological sites for the synthesis , binding and release of neurotransmitters in dopaminergic dendrites in the substantia nigra and cholinergic dendrites in the neostriatum .
37984|Morphological evidence is presented indicating sites of synthesis , storage , and release of neurotransmitters in dendrites of dopaminergic cells of the substantia nigra and cholinergic cells of the neostriatum .
37984|In the neostriatum , dopaminergic nerve endings make asymmetrical axospinous contacts .
37986|Rotational behaviour can be induced in rats with unilateral kainic acid induced degeneration of the neostriatum and adjacent regions by means of dopaminergic drugs .
3803469|Intra-regional variations in the effect of aging on high affinity choline uptake , choline acetyltransferase and muscarinic cholinergic receptors in rat neostriatum .
3803469|High affinity sodium-dependent choline uptake -LRB- HACU -RRB- , choline acetyltransferase -LRB- ChAT -RRB- and quinuclidinyl benzilate binding -LRB- -LSB- 3H -RSB- - QNB -RRB- are measured in synaptosomal preparations from four areas of the neostriatum of Fischer 344 rats of three different ages -LRB- 6 , 18 and 30 months -RRB- .
3803469|In addition , in the medial neostriatum , all three measures are higher rostrally than caudally .
3803469|HACU is reduced with age in the rostromedial and the caudolateral neostriatum .
3803469|Small -LRB- usually less than 20 % -RRB- but significant decreases in muscarinic cholinergic receptors occur in all regions of the neostriatum .
3809834|Evoked potentials of telencephalic structures were studied after stimulation of the bill , quintofrontal tract -LRB- QF -RRB- , and several telencephalic structures -LRB- nucleus basalis -LSB- Bas -RSB- , neostriatum frontale -LSB- NF -RSB- , paleostriatum augmentatum -LSB- PA -RSB- , and neostriatum caudale -LSB- NC -RSB- -RRB- .
3815115|Autoradiographic analysis of their brains revealed 3 well demarcated areas of increased 2DG accumulation in the rostral forebrain of imprinted chicks compared to controls : HAD in the rostral Wulst ; MNH , an auditory area in the rostromedial neostriatum and hyperstriatum ventrale ; LNH in the rostrolateral neostriatum and hyperstriatum ventrale .
3819015|Synaptic organization of cholinergic neurons in the monkey neostriatum .
3819015|DiFiglia M. Cholinergic neurons in the monkey neostriatum were examined at the light and electron microscopic level by immunohistochemical methods in order to localize choline acetyltransferase -LRB- ChAT -RRB- , the synthesizing enzyme for acetylcholine .
3819015|The results suggest that cholinergic neurons in the primary neostriatum belong to a single morphological class corresponding to the large aspiny -LRB- type II -RRB- interneuron identified in previous Golgi studies .
3828778|The target areas include the nucleus accumbens and the ventromedial part of the neostriatum , whereas the dorsolateral part of the neostriatum does not receive such afferents .
3828778|Taking this topography into account , the present results show that local application of cis-flupenthixol -LRB- 10-40 micrograms/side -RRB- into the nucleus accumbens or the ventromedial , but not the dorsolateral , neostriatum produces suppression of exploratory locomotor activity in the rat .
3843722|In rat , gustatory thalamocortical projections from VPMpc thalamus traverse the ventrolateral neostriatum -LRB- VLS -RRB- enroute to the AIGN .
3850028|The sites of origin of ascending projections to the telencephalon in the pigeon -LRB- Columba livia -RRB- were studied by means of the retrograde fluorescence technique following the injection of various tracers -LRB- Evans Blue , Fast Blue , Nuclear Yellow -RRB- concomitantly into different regions of topographically distinct areas of one hemisphere : hyperstriatum -LRB- HY -RRB- , ectostriatum-paleostriatum -LRB- EP -RRB- , posterior neostriatum -LRB- PN -RRB- .
3850028|Single ipsilateral projections upon either the ectostriatum or the caudal neostriatum arise from the nucleus -LRB- n. -RRB- rotundus/n .
3850028|Multiple ipsilateral afferents to both HY and the neostriatum intermedium stem from rostral and caudal portions of the n. dorsolateralis posterior respectively , whereas the n. subrotundus projects to all of the telencephalic sites examined .
3859754|In vivo , coadministration of citalopram or chlorimipramine with methamphetamine blocked the irreversible depression of tryptophan hydroxylase activity observed in the neostriatum and cerebral cortex after repeated administration of high doses of methamphetamine .

3873268|Antidromic activation of dorsal raphe neurons from neostriatum : physiological characterization and effects of terminal autoreceptor activation .
3873268|The relatively long conduction time to neostriatum of the Type 1 presumed serotonergic neuron is discussed with respect to previous interpretations of the synaptic action of serotonin in the neostriatum .
3873268|In conjunction with these antidromic activation studies , the neurophysiological consequences of serotonergic terminal autoreceptor activation were examined by measuring changes in the excitability of serotonergic terminal fields in the neostriatum following administration of the serotonin autoreceptor agonist , 5-methoxy-N , N-dimethyltryptamine -LRB- 5-MeODMT -RRB- .
3873268|The excitability of serotonergic terminal fields was decreased by intravenous injection of 40 micrograms/kg 5-MeODMT , and by infusion of 10-50 microM 5-MeODMT directly into the neostriatum .
3875055|Intracerebroventricular administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1 ,2,3,6 - tetrahydropyridine -LRB- MPTP -RRB- and its metabolite 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion -LRB- MPP + -RRB- decrease dopamine and increase acetylcholine in the mouse neostriatum .
3875055|We found that both MPTP and its metabolite MPP + decrease dopamine and increase acetylcholine content of mouse neostriatum when administered intracerebroventricularly -LRB- ICV -RRB- .
3877147|Using the mouse , we found that MPTP induces a fall of dopamine and a rise of acetylcholine in the neostriatum .
3907415|In the neostriatum -LRB- caudate nucleus and putamen -RRB- of all mammalian species investigated , the immunoreactive fibers were distinct varicose fibers in a fine network .
3907415|The concentration of these fibers was high in the ventral , medial and caudal neostriatum .
3908999|Antibodies against human placental choline acetyltransferase -LRB- ChAT -RRB- were used to immunohistochemically stain cholinergic neurons in the neostriatum and nucleus basalis of Meynert in human brain .
3924338|Unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine injections into the lateral neostriatum disrupted the ability of rats to retrieve small food pellets with the contralateral forepaw .
3935983|Brundin P , Barbin G , Isacson O , Mallat M , Chamak B , Prochiantz A , Gage FH , Bjrklund A. Fetal rat dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- neurons were cultured in vitro for a 6-day period and transported , after redissociation , for 2 days prior to being grafted to the neostriatum of adult rats with 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the ascending nigrostriatal pathway .
3941757|No effect was seen in cerebellum , optic tectum , neostriatum , hippocampus and medulla oblongata .
3942882|Multiple amphetamine injections reduce the release of ascorbic acid in the neostriatum of the rat .
3942882|Voltammetric signals were recorded bilaterally with unmodified or electrochemically-modified carbon-fiber electrodes in the neostriatum of rats that sustained a unilateral depletion of dopamine by pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine .
3942882|It appears , therefore , that multiple amphetamine injections reduce the release of ascorbic acid in the neostriatum and that this effect does not depend on the integrity of dopaminergic neurons .
3948021|An autoradiographic study of the postnatal development of pericruciate cortical projections to the neostriatum and the claustrum of the cat .
3948021|Contralateral terminal fields were labelled less intensely and occupied areas symmetrical to those within the ipsilateral neostriatum and claustrum .
3948030|Formation of 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone and oestradiol-17 beta was higher in the preoptic area and posterior hypothalamus than either the area basalis or neostriatum intermediale , whereas 5 beta-dihydrotestosterone yield did not differ between brain areas .
3950089|Large neurons in the primate neostriatum examined with the combined Golgi-electron microscopic method .
3950089|DiFiglia M , Carey J. Large neurons in the monkey neostriatum were examined in the electron microscope in tissue treated with the rapid-Golgi impregnation method followed by the gold-toning procedure .
3950089|These findings confirm that the two types of large neurons identified in Golgi impregnations of the primate neostriatum are also different at the ultrastructural level , both in their cytological features and in their synaptic organization .
3954871|Increased 2-deoxyglucose incorporation were found in 3 rostral forebrain areas of separated chicks , namely the hyperstriatum accessorium/hyperstriatum dorsale , the lateral neostriatum/hyperstriatum ventrale and the medial neostriatum/hyperstriatum ventrale .
3955388|Monoamine concentrations -LRB- DA , serotonin and their metabolites -RRB- were measured , using high pressure liquid chromatography , in the neostriatum , nucleus accumbens , and medial prefrontal cortex in rats that were either induced to walk forward in a motorized rotating wheel -LRB- two speeds -RRB- or were exposed to footshock stress -LRB- two shock intensities -RRB- .
3955388|Furthermore , the increase in DA metabolism was found : -LRB- a -RRB- in both right and left neostriatal nuclei , but with significantly less asymmetry than occurred in non-locomoting control rats ; and -LRB- b -RRB- within the neostriatum at both speeds and also in the nucleus accumbens at the higher speed .
3956632|Based on the results of this study , it appears that cholinergic projections to intralaminar thalamic nuclei which in turn project to the neostriatum may be one of the pathways over which PPN can affect basal ganglia activity .
3958792|In two of these song-related brain regions , magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- MAN -RRB- and hyperstriatum ventrale pars caudale -LRB- HVc -RRB- , males have a larger percentage of androgen-accumulating cells than females .

3986508|The frequency and distribution of medium-sized neurons with indented nuclei in the primate and rodent neostriatum .
3986508|Graveland GA , DiFiglia M. Nuclear morphology is known to distinguish two classes of medium-sized neurons in the neostriatum , spiny projection neurons which have an unindented nucleus and aspiny interneurons which exhibit enfoldings of their nuclear envelope .
3986508|Findings suggest that aspiny interneurons play a greater role in the integrative and functional organization of the neostriatum in the primate than in the rodent brain .
3988987|A Golgi study of the human neostriatum : neurons and afferent fibers .
3988987|The neostriatum of 20 adult humans was examined in Golgi-Kopsch and rapid Golgi preparations .
3988994|Nucleus basalis projects upon a belt of neurons within the overlying neostriatum .

3989280|Highest receptor density was observed in the hyperstriatum ventrale , palaeostriatum augmentatum , septum , and parts of the archistriatum In sites of known sensory input of neostriatum -LRB- field L -RRB- and ectostriatum low receptor binding was observed .
3995275|The highest ratio was found in the anteroventromedial region -LRB- containing the presumed homologue of the mammalian neostriatum -RRB- , and the next highest in the posteroventrolateral region -LRB- containing the archistriatum -RRB- .
3996499|This bilateral projection pattern from area 6 to the caudate nucleus and putamen is consistent with the hypothesis that the neostriatum maintains a close anatomical and functional relationship with area 6 .

402443|The perikarya and processes of two types of neurons of the neostriatum , representing a small percentage of all neurons in this structure , are intensely stained .
402443|The present data are compatible with the idea that the large AChE neurons of the neostriatum may be the source of the acetylcholinesterasic striatopallidal and strionigral fibers .

4024873|The action of d-amphetamine on the histochemical activities of succinic and malic dehydrogenases in sections of cerebral cortex , cerebellum , and neostriatum has been studied .
402696|Angiotensin injected into the neostriatum after learning disrupts retention performance .
402696|Morgan JM , Routtenberg A. Angiotensin II , injected into the dorsal neostriatum of rats 5 minutes after they had learned a passive avoidance task , disrupted the retention of the task 24 hours later .
402696|Ventral neostriatum or posterior thalamus were ineffective sites for injection of angiotensin .
402696|Injection of thyrotropin releasing hormone or lysine-8-vasopressin into the dorsal neostriatum was ineffective .

6146944|Dopamine and cholecystokinin immunoreactive neurons in mesencephalic grafts reinnervating the neostriatum : evidence for selective growth regulation .
6146944|Only those fibres which contained tyrosine hydroxylase but apparently lacked the cholecystokinin-like peptide showed extensive reinnervation of the host neostriatum .
6146944|These results indicate that the dopaminergic reinnervation of the denervated neostriatum is preferentially carried out by the population of grafted mesencephalic dopamine neurones apparently lacking the cholecystokinin-like peptide .
6146944|This suggests the presence of growth regulating mechanisms in the denervated neostriatum which selectively favour the ingrowth of fibres from the appropriate dopaminergic neuronal subset .

6194006|In chicks , monaurally deafened at 3 weeks of age , 2-deoxyglucose labeling of the input layer L2 in the auditory neostriatum -LRB- field L -RRB- was analyzed after acoustic stimulation .
6194008|In intracellular recordings from neostriatal neurons in urethane anesthetized rats this long-lasting inhibitory response -LRB- 1 -RRB- exhibited alterations with intracellularly applied steady currents comparable to those of the EPSP , -LRB- 2 -RRB- failed to respond to intracellular injection of chloride ions , -LRB- 3 -RRB- was associated with either a decrease or no detectable change in the input conductance of the neurons , and -LRB- 4 -RRB- was abolished after lesions that interrupted polysynaptic pathways to neostriatum through intracortical and intrathalamic synaptic circuits .
6194474|The procedure is illustrated by examples from the monkey retina , cat visual cortex and rat neostriatum .
6198034|In the normal brain , substance P immunoreactivity was identified in medium-sized neurons in the neostriatum , in neurons of the external segment of the globus pallidus , and in fine fibers in teh neostriatum , inner segment of the globus pallidus , and in the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra .
6198034|Leucine-enkephalin immunoreactive processes were present throughout the neostriatum of normal brain , and were densely packed in the external segment of the globus pallidus and in the substantia nigra .
6198034|A few medium-size neurons and sparse fibers with leucine-enkephalin immunoreactivity persisted in the atrophic neostriatum .
6206434|Marked decreases in the activity of tryptophan hydroxylase -LRB- TPH -RRB- were observed in both the cerebral cortex and neostriatum after 6 hr , with maximum depression observed at 24 hr .

6207274|After placement of electrolytic lesions in the rostro-dorsal neostriatum , degenerating boutons were found in symmetrical synaptic contact with the cell bodies and dendrites of six identified pallidonigral neurons .
6207274|It is concluded that pallidonigral neurons belong to the Golgi category of large pallidal neurons with smooth dendrites and that they receive monosynaptic input from the neostriatum .
6207274|Thus , in addition to the direct striatonigral pathway , the neostriatum can influence the substantia nigra by a monosynaptic relay through the globus pallidus , which might allow other pallidal afferents to influence the transfer of information from neostriatum to substantia nigra .

6293642|Independent in vitro regulation by the D-2 dopamine receptor of dopamine-stimulated efflux of cyclic AMP and K + - stimulated release of acetylcholine from rat neostriatum .
6293642|Two types of dopamine receptors whose stimulation affect cAMP efflux -LRB- and by inference formation -RRB- could be identified in rat neostriatum .
6293642|The dopamine receptor mediating inhibition of the release of radiolabeled acetylcholine -LRB- ACh -RRB- in the neostriatum appeared to have the same pharmacological characteristics as the D-2 dopamine receptor mediating the inhibition of the D-1 receptor agonist induced cAMP efflux .
6293642|Although the pharmacological characteristics of the dopamine receptors mediating inhibition of both ACh release and -LRB- D-1 dopamine receptor agonist induced -RRB- cAMP efflux appeared to be similar , drugs stimulating cAMP efflux did not affect ACh release or LY 141865 induced inhibition of ACh release from rat neostriatum .
6294150|As a consequence of their disk-shaped dendritic field , neurons belonging to the laterally placed subgroup and occupying the narrow -LRB- ca. 100 micrometers thick -RRB- striopallidal border zone known to receive a distinct input from neostriatum have dendrites restricted to that zone .
6297671|For structures that normally receive a dopaminergic innervation -LRB- e.g. , neostriatum , nucleus accumbens septi , olfactory tubercle -RRB- the autoradiographic density of the injured side was decreased relative to the intact hemisphere .
6297671|In contrast , rats that did recover showed no hemispheric asymmetries within the anterior neostriatum , globus pallidus , or substantia nigra pars reticulata at 6 weeks postoperatively , and the time course of normalization of metabolic activity in these structures was similar to that for behavioral restoration .
6297671|These results directly demonstrate the importance of the neostriatum and particular structures efferent to it in the recovery of sensorimotor functions after striatal dopamine depletion .

6318902|Injection of -LSB- 3H -RSB- taurine into the neostriatum of the rat led to accumulation of radioactivity in a distinct population of neurons .
6318902|It is suggested that taurine-accumulating neurons in the neostriatum are projection neurons .
6320045|Two levels of functional heterogeneity of the neostriatum .
6320045|The present material demonstrates that this coactivation may appear in patches in the rat neostriatum .

6348595|In this regard , the CCK innervation of limbic structures is quite different from that of the neostriatum .
6348595|It has been reported that the CCK innervation of the neostriatum is derived primarily from piriform cortex as a descending corticostriatal projection .

640860|Age-dependent increase in the non-specific cholinesterase activity of the capillaries in the rat neostriatum .
640860|Panula P , Rechardt L. Histochemically demonstrable non-specific cholinesterase activity in the capillaries of the neostriatum of 3-5-month-old rats was much weaker than that of 24-27-month-old rats .
6409351|One mechanism that may contribute to this behavioral recovery is the proliferation of dopamine receptor sites in the affected neostriatum .
6409351|Lithium treatment did not prevent the augmentation of -LSB- 3H -RSB- spiroperidol binding in the neostriatum ipsilateral to the lesion , relative to the contralateral control neostriatum , at 4 or 8 weeks post-operatively .
6414645|Acetylcholinesterase associated with dopaminergic innervation of the neostriatum : histochemical observations of a heterogeneous distribution .
6414645|Marshall JF , Van Oordt K , Kozlowski MR. Unilateral injections of 6-hydroxydopamine that damaged the mesotelencephalic dopaminergic projection resulted in decreased acetylcholinesterase -LRB- AChE -RRB- staining in the ipsilateral neostriatum .
6414645|This reduction , which was most apparent in the posterior and medial anterior neostriatum , occurred in rats killed 3 days or more after the 6-hydroxydopamine injection .
6414645|Thus , some of the AChE in the neostriatum appears to be localized to its dopaminergic innervation ; however , the enzyme may be heterogeneously distributed throughout this structure 's dopaminergic afferent fibers .
6415508|Biochemical assay data revealed that dopamine levels were significantly reduced both in nucleus accumbens septi -LRB- NAS -RRB- and olfactory tubercle -LRB- OT -RRB- but not neostriatum ; thus it was concluded that amphetamine - and apomorphine-induced locomotor activity is mediated by the mesolimbic dopamine system .
6416611|Thus , retrograde labeling of SN-VTA cells with fluorescent dyes provided a quantitative measure of the dopaminergic innervation of the neostriatum in both the uncrossed and crossed pathways .
6418330|Garnett S , Firnau G , Nahmias C , Chirakal R. Positron emission tomography , using the dopa analogue -LSB- 18F -RSB- 6-fluoro-L-dopa , has been used to depict the neostriatum in living monkeys .
6421114|Fibers from the main cluster of compacta neurons terminate more dorsally and those from the dorsal part of the SN end more ventrally in the neostriatum .
6426699|Thus the experiments permit screening of areas within neostriatum that produce different rotational responses to chromaffin implants .
6427648|Sensorimotor impairment and elevated levels of dopamine metabolites in the neostriatum occur rapidly after intranigral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine or gamma-hydroxybutyrate in awake rats .
6427648|This neglect developed in a caudal to rostral direction on the affected body surface and coincided with significant elevation in the concentrations of dopamine and two of its metabolites , dihydroxyphenylacetic acid -LRB- DOPAC -RRB- and homovanillic acid -LRB- HVA -RRB- in the ipsilateral neostriatum .
6427648|Concentrations of dopamine , dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid in the neostriatum were markedly elevated during continuous infusions of procaine or gamma-hydroxybutyric acid .
6427648|The extent of sensory neglect and changes in dopamine metabolism in the neostriatum varied according to the amount of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid injected into the nigra and according to the proximity of injections of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid to the pars compacta .
6427648|The rapid onset of sensory neglect following microinjections of 6-hydroxydopamine , procaine or gamma-hydroxybutyric acid is consistent with the ability of each of these drugs to block the conduction of impulses in mesostriatal neurons and suggests that concomitant increases in levels of dopamine , dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid in the neostriatum resulted from decreases in the release of dopamine coupled with increased synthesis of dopamine .

6448915|KA-injected animals showed reduced utilization of DG in the injected neostriatum as well as in the ipsilateral rostral sulcal cortex , dentate fascia of hippocampus , ventromedial nucleus of the thalamus and cortico-bulbar tract .
6452058|Comings DE , Goetz IE , Holden J , Holtz J. Injection of kainic acid , a rigid analog of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamic acid -LRB- glu -RRB- , into the neostriatum of rats produces a condition that mimics Huntington disease -LRB- HD -RRB- in at least 12 different morphological and biochemical parameters .
6452929|Previous reports indicate that amphetamine produces a dose-dependent shift to the firing rate of neurons in the anterior neostriatum that parallels the shift in behavior from locomotion to focused stereotypy .
6452929|To determine if para-chlorophenylalanine -LRB- PCPA -RRB- , which alters the pattern of the behavioral response to amphetamine , also changes the pattern of the neuronal response to the drug , a dose-response analysis was performed on amphetamine-induced changes in unit activity in the anterior neostriatum of rats pretreated 48 h previously with 300 mg/kg PCPA or vehicle .
6452929|The differential effects of PCPA on the action of low and high doses of D-amphetamine in the anterior neostriatum may explain the differential influence of serotonergic systems on amphetamine-induced locomotion add stereotypy .

6468694|Nonadaptive forms of behaviour were accompanied by a drop of the dophamine level in the neostriatum .
6468694|The effects of the dophaminomimetics were suppressed by administration of haloperidol -LRB- 10 micrograms -RRB- and naloxon -LRB- 0.8 micrograms -RRB- into the same area of the caudate nucleus which attested a functional interrelationship between the dophamine - and enkephalin-containing systems of the neostriatum in regulation of feeding behaviour .
647399|The paleostriatum augmentatum -LRB- PA -RRB- , a cell field comparable to mammalian caudate nucleus and putamen , was found to receive projections from a distinct population of elencephalic neurons in the temporal-parietal-occipital -LRB- TPO -RRB- and lateral cortical -LRB- CDL -RRB- areas of the neostriatum .
647399|TPO neurons , in turn , were found to receive projections from the contralateral ventral archistriatum -LRB- Av -RRB- and from neurons in the ipsilateral frontal neostriatum adjacent to the rostral portion of the ectostriatum -LRB- e -RRB- .

654713|The density of labeled cells in the majority of all thalamic nuclei increased if the HRP was extended from the dorsal ventricular ridge into the neostriatum and the pallial thickening with adjacent general cortex .
654713|HRP positive cells in the pretectal area , nuclei of the posterior commissura and mesencephalic ventro-lateral tegmentum were observed only in cases when the enzyme was diffused from the injection site into the neostriatum , while the HRP retrograde transport to n. geniculatus lateralis , pars dorsalis was revealed only when HRP was extended into the pallial thickening and adjacent general cortex .
6568149|The neostriatum viewed orthogonally .
6568149|The work described in this paper suggests that : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the neostriatum -LRB- a tier of the forebrain -RRB- is functionally heterogeneous , i.e. different neostriatal regions mediate responses in different situations ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- regional specialization may be attributed to selective cortico-neostriatal connections , as indicated by anatomical and neurobehavioural evidence and studies with 2-deoxyglucose ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- cortical areas and their corresponding principal neostriatal regions are organized ` in series ' ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- small lesions which cause severe but specific ` cognitive ' effects do not induce movement disorders ; -LRB- 5 -RRB- the transmitter of the cortico-neostriatal connections is glutamate .
6568149|This view , with three additional assumptions , can tentatively explain not only experimental neurobehavioural results but also certain symptoms of diseases involving the neostriatum .

6576121|The possibility to use the new ligand 3H-domperidone to identify some dopamine binding sites at the ultrastructural level was assessed in the neostriatum after in vivo administration and high-resolution radioautography .
6576121|Moreover we confirm the existence of dopaminergic synapses in the neostriatum with this new technique .
658185|The concentrations of dopamine in the neostriatum remain unchanged .
6583315|Since Carlsson 's original suggestion that dopamine may be a transmitter in the central nervous system involved in the control of motor function and that it may be involved in the Parkinsonian syndrome -LRB- Carlsson , 1959 -RRB- , and the now-classic paper by Ehringer and Hornykiewicz -LRB- 1960 -RRB- which definitively showed the significant reduction of dopamine concentration in the neostriatum of cases of idiopathic Parkinson and postencephalitic parkinsonism , the vast amount of work on the subject has focused on the biochemical and pharmacologic correlates of this dopaminergic system failure involving particularly the nigrostriatal pathways .
6586057|Neuronal cell suspensions prepared from the ventral mesencephalon and the septal-diagonal band area of rat embryos were implanted into the depth of the intact neostriatum or hippocampus of 21-23 month old female rats .
6586058|While the grafts survived well in all sites , the dopamine fibre outgrowth was markedly different depending on whether the grafts occurred in an area normally innervated by the mesencephalic dopamine neurones -LRB- i.e. neostriatum or nc .
6591208|The most heavily labeled regions of the telencephalon are the hippocampal formation , lateral septum , cortical regions , neostriatum , and amygdaloid complex .
659674|Topography of the dopamine projection to the basal forebrain and neostriatum .
659674|The topography of the DA neuron projection of the basal forebrain and neostriatum is organized in three planes , dorsal-ventral , medial-lateral and anterior-posterior .
659674|Ventral cells of the SN and VTA project to the dorsal structures of the basal forebrain such as the septum , nucleus accumbens and neostriatum .
659674|The medial-lateral topography is organized such that the medial sectors of the SN-VTA area project to the medial parts of nuclei in the basal forebrain and neostriatum whereas lateral sectors of the SN-VTA area project to the lateral parts of nuclei in the basal forebrain and neostriatum .
6606137|The present results indicate that the inhibitor of 5-HT uptake fluoxetine , prevented the long-term depletion of 5-HT produced by large doses of methamphetamine -LRB- 15 mg/kg X 5 , 6 hr apart -RRB- in the neostriatum and hippocampus , while simultaneously augmenting the depletion of DA produced by this drug in the neostriatum .
6606137|In these doses -LRB- 15 mg/kg X 5,6 hr apart -RRB- , d-amphetamine did not produce long-lasting depletion of 5-HT in either the neostriatum or hippocampus .
6611514|We now report that MPTP , given to mice at 30 mg/kg intraperitoneally , causes severe and long-lasting depletions of dopamine and its major metabolites dihydroxyphenylacetic acid -LRB- DOPAC -RRB- and homovanillic acid -LRB- HVA -RRB- in the neostriatum .
6615635|Only dopamine concentrations in the neostriatum of high-ranking males were reliably different -LRB- higher -RRB- from concentrations of low-ranking males .

6616234|Neuronal responses to 1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg D-amphetamine were recorded simultaneously in the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens of rats pretreated twice daily with these doses or with saline for 6 consecutive days .
6616234|During the first 30-60 min of the drug response , however , neurons in the neostriatum of amphetamine-pretreated rats responded with a significant increase in firing rate compared to saline controls .
6616234|Liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection revealed that pretreatment with 5.0 mg/kg D-amphetamine produced a slight , but significant , reduction of dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the neostriatum .

6627034|Inhibition in the neostriatum in vitro is demonstrated as reduction in test amplitude in paired shock tests , by the presence of IPSPs and by the shunting of EPSPs conditioned by an action potential triggered by direct depolarization .
6631478|A local infusion of d-amphetamine -LRB- d-AMPH -RRB- into the dorsal raphe nucleus -LRB- DRN -RRB- inhibited neuronal activity in this site and produced a mirror-image excitation in the ventrolateral , but not dorsomedial , neostriatum .
6631478|At both doses , however , DRN activity was inversely related to firing rate in the ventrolateral , but not dorsomedial , neostriatum .
6631478|These results indicate that only certain regions of the neostriatum are responsive to changes in DRN activity and that these regions respond differently to systemic injections of d-AMPH than other neostriatal sites .

6647505|When administered to the neostriatum , DA -LRB- 80-160 micrograms/side -RRB- produced a stimulation of locomotor activity , 6-9 min after placement in the open field .
6647505|The administration of l-NA -LRB- 20-80 micrograms/side -RRB- to the neostriatum produced a suppression of the exploratory locomotor activity -LRB- 0-6 min -RRB- .
6647505|As assessed in the present experiments DA and l-NA produced identical effects in the nucleus accumbens , l-NA being about 4 times as potent as DA , whereas opposite effects were produced by l-NA and DA when applied to the neostriatum .

Opioid peptide-like -LRB- OPL -RRB- - immunoreactivity and -LRB- the GABA-biosynthetic enzyme -RRB- glutamic acid decarboxylase-like -LRB- GAD -RRB- - immunoreactivity were localized in rat neostriatum and central amygdaloid nucleus -LRB- ACE -RRB- using a polyclonal sheep antiserum to rat brain GAD and a monoclonal mouse antibody to the N-terminus of beta-endorphin -LRB- 3-E7 -RRB- as primary antisera .
6664248|PAP-immunohistochemistry revealed GAD-immunoreactivity in the majority of neurons in neostriatum and ACE .

6664466|Single unit recording in the substantia nigra pars compacta -LRB- SNC -RRB- and the neostriatum , on the following day , revealed a differential shift in the intravenous dose of the drug required to produce at least a 50 % change in neuronal activity -LRB- ED50 -RRB- depending on the pretreatment dose .
6664466|In the neostriatum , control rats responded to increasing incremental doses of -LRB- + -RRB- - amphetamine with either an inhibition followed by an excitation , or an excitation .
6664466|Following pretreatment with 1.0 mg/kg , neurons responded with either a depression or an excitation , whereas only amphetamine-induced excitations were recorded in the neostriatum following pretreatment with 5.0 mg/kg .
6664467|Increased dopamine metabolism in the rat neostriatum after toxic doses of d-methylamphetamine .
6664467|Both the rate constant of the synthesis of DA and the DOPAC/DA ratio were increased in the neostriatum of rats with large depletions of neostriatal DA .
6673995|The majority of the somatic responses were localised in the paleostriatum augmentatum , the neostriatum and the neostriatum caudale .
6673995|Stimulation of the bill and the head elicited responses in tractus quinto-frontalis , paleostriatum augmentatum , neostriatum and neostriatum caudale while activation from the body were mainly localised in neostriatum caudale and paleostriatum augmentatum .
667628|The anatomical results suggest that kainic acid appears to affect only perikarya of the neostriatum and the axons originating from these perikarya , whereas passing axons seem to remain intact .
667628|Thus , the observed behavioral impairment must be attributed to changes in the neostriatum itself .
667628|It is concluded that the neostriatum has ` complex ' or ` cognitive ' functions and that some mental symptoms in Huntington 's chorea may be attributed to a dysfunction of this part of the brain .

6697180|The occurrence of large acetylcholinesterase-containing neurons in human neostriatum as disclosed in normal and Alzheimer-diseased brains .
6697180|The human neostriatum was found to contain large neurons -LRB- maximum diameter : 30-40 microns -RRB- that stain intensely for acetylcholinesterase -LRB- AChE -RRB- .
6697180|These findings suggest that large intrinsic cholinergic neurons exist in human neostriatum and that these elements , in contrast to those of nucleus basalis , are not affected in Alzheimer 's disease .
67024|These structures comprised the intralaminar and midline thalamic nuclei , the neostriatum , and some posterior thalamic association nuclei -LRB- Pulvinar and nucleus lateralis posterior -RRB- .

6713203|Presynaptic muscarinic modulation of nicotinic excitation in the rat neostriatum .
6713203|It is concluded that in the neostriatum presynaptic muscarinic receptors modulate nicotinic excitation since potassium-stimulated ACh release and intrinsically evoked synaptic excitation are influenced by muscarinic drugs in the same way .

6721218|Brand S , Rakic P. Cytodifferentiation and synaptogenesis in the neostriatum -LRB- caudate nucleus and putamen -RRB- were analyzed by the Golgi impregnation method and electron microscopy in 14 fetuses and 8 postnatal rhesus monkeys .
6721218|During the second fetal month the neostriatum consists primarily of simple , mostly bipolar , immature cells and a small number of undefined profiles ending with growth cones .
6721218|During the fourth fetal month the four principal cell classes of the neostriatum emerge .
6722582|The transient presence of estrogen target neurons during the phase of rapid dendritic development and synaptogenesis in the caudate n. immediately after birth raises the question of whether gonadal hormones may influence sexual differentiation in the neostriatum .
6726290|Aspiny neurons and their local axons in the neostriatum of the rat : a correlated light and electron microscopic study of Golgi-impregnated material .
6726290|Three types of neuron with smooth -LRB- aspiny -RRB- dendrites could be distinguished in the Golgi-impregnated rat neostriatum .
6726290|Examples of each type of aspiny neuron were found with local axon collaterals within the neostriatum and these were selected for gold - toning and examination in the electron microscope .
6726290|It is concluded that the synaptic terminals of at least four types of neuron , the three aspiny types described here and the medium-size densely spiny neuron , participate in local circuit interactions in the neostriatum .
6733461|In addition to the nucleus basalis , these structures include trigeminal projection areas in the frontal and caudal neostriatum both of which project upon the intermediate archistriatum .
6733505|Activity of nigral dopaminergic neurons after lesion of the neostriatum in rats .
6733505|As shown by post-mortem analysis the major neuropathological trait of Huntington 's chorea is a degeneration of the intrinsic neurons of the neostriatum -LRB- caudate nucleus and putamen -RRB- .
6733505|Such a situation can be reproduced by a destruction of the neostriatum by kainic acid .
6733505|When injected into the caudate nucleus this excitatory amino acid destroys the intrinsic neurons of the neostriatum and spares fairly well the passing fibers .
6733505|After destruction of the neostriatum , we have shown that the pattern of discharge of most identified nigral dopaminergic neurons becomes greatly disorganized .
6741279|Participation of the neostriatum in sensorimotor integration is discussed .
6754878|Synaptic connections of enkephalin-immunoreactive nerve terminals in the neostriatum : a correlated light and electron microscopic study .
6754878|Somogyi P , Priestley JV , Cuello AC , Smith AD , Takagi H. Two different antisera to leucine-enkephalin were used to study the localization of enkephalin-like immunoreactive material in the neostriatum and globus pallidus of the rat , by means of the unlabelled antibody-enzyme method .
6754878|Thin immunoreactive varicose fibres are scattered throughout the neostriatum .
6754878|Occasional immunoreactive varicose fibres are also found close to another type of neuron throughout the whole neostriatum .
6754878|In the globus pallidus , all the enkephalin-immunoreactive boutons studied formed symmetrical synapses with ensheathed dendrites and perikarya that were similar to the latter type of postsynaptic neuron in the neostriatum .
6754878|The results are consistent with the view that enkephalin-like substances may be synaptic transmitters in the neostriatum and that they may have different actions according to the nature of the postsynaptic target .
6754878|The finding that one type of neostriatal neuron , and a very similar neuron in the globus pallidus , receives multiple enkephalin-immunoreactive boutons all over its perikaryon and along its dendrites indicates a potentially important role of enkephalin in the convergence of information within the neostriatum and pallidum on to output neurons .

6775498|Functions of the neostriatum : cortex-dependent or autonomous ?
6775498|Divac I. Studies of animals with ablations of varying amounts of the neocortex , the neostriatum , or both , are reviewed in an attempt to establish to which extent functions of the neostriatum are dependent on its cortical input .
6775498|It seems well established that the neostriatum shares some functions with the neocortex .
6775498|It is possible , and even likely , that the neostriatum also has functions which are not shared with the cortex and which are cortex-independent .
6775498|The degree to which the neostriatum is able to contribute to the integration of behavior in the absence of its cortical input is species - and age-specific .

6796195|Previous studies have shown that transplants of embryonic substantia nigra , which reinnervate the dorsal neostriatum , can compensate for certain , but not all , behavioural deficits induced by unilateral or bilateral destruction of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathways in adult rats .
6796195|The present study shows the nigral transplants which are placed in the lateral cortex so as to reinnervate ventral and lateral parts of the neostriatum , give an entirely different pattern of behavioural recovery .

6815549|The histology suggested that the lesions were topographically specific , and it is therefore concluded that the neostriatum is topographically homogeneous in the mediation of rotational behaviour as measured in automated rotometers .

6841665|Bolam JP , Clarke DJ , Smith AD , Somogyi P. Light microscopic autoradiography was used to identify cells in the neostriatum that became labelled after the local injection of -LSB- 3H -RSB- gamma-aminobutyrate -LRB- GABA -RRB- .
6841665|We conclude that one type of GABAergic neuron in the neostriatum is a type of medium-sized aspiny neuron and that this neuron is likely to receive synaptic input both from neurons within the striatum and from neurons in distant brain regions .
6841665|We suggest that this neuron is a local circuit neuron in the neostriatum since its morphological features are quite distinct from those of identified projecting neurons .

6935693|Synaptic endings and their postsynaptic targets in neostriatum : synaptic specializations revealed from analysis of serial sections .
6935693|None of these synaptic endings appeared to lack synaptic contact with postsynaptic targets in the neostriatum .
6935693|Our evidence supports the view that dopaminergic and other synaptic terminals in the rat caudate-putamen make synaptic contact with postsynaptic targets in the neostriatum and , at least in the adult , do not exist in appreciable numbers in the form of terminals that are not apposed to membranes of postsynaptic targets in the neostriatum .
6968761|The results demonstrate that dopaminergic terminals in the neostriatum are critical for orientation .
6968761|Further , the results suggest that dopaminergic terminals in the anterior neostriatum are especially important for orientation to touch of the rostral body surface while those in the posterior neostriatum are most critical for orientation to caudal touch .
6968761|After damage to all branches of the mesotelencephalic dopaminergic system , orientation to touch was reinstated by injection of apomorphine into the neostriatum but not by injection into the other dopamine-innervated forebrain regions tested .

6991552|By light microscopy , neuronal perikarya and processes showing enkephalin-like immunoreactivity -LRB- ELI -RRB- were unevenly distributed throughout the neostriatum .
6991552|The labeled perikarya measured 10 -- 15 micrometer in diameter and constituted about 15 -- 20 % of the total neurons in the neostriatum .

7052452|A comparison of the distribution of acetylcholinesterase and muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the feline neostriatum .
7052452|In the cat neostriatum the histochemical distribution of acetylcholinesterase -LRB- AChE -RRB- was compared with the autoradiographic localization of the cholinergic muscarinic antagonist -LSB- 3 - -LRB- 3 -RRB- H -RSB- quinuclidinyl benzilate -LRB- -LSB- 3H -RSB- QNB -RRB- .
7052452|While the AChE was found to be localized in a pattern of AChE dense and sparse zones the muscarinic receptors were distributed evenly throughout the neostriatum .
7052452|The results suggest that the AChE histochemical patches in the neostriatum are not indicative of the distribution of cholinergic synapses .
7056316|Depolarizing IPSPs and Depolarization by GABA of rat neostriatum cells in vitro .
7056316|These results are compatible with the assumption that GABA is the transmitter of an intrinsic inhibition in rat neostriatum , but indicate that GABA-mediated IPSPs of neostriatal cells in vitro are depolarizing at the resting membrane potential .
7059376|Regulatory impairments following selective 6-OHDA lesions of the neostriatum .
7066707|On the other hand , numerous large-sized AChE cells are scattered throughout the neostriatum .
7066707|However , the AChE cells in putamen appear morphologically different , more numerous per mm2 , and larger than those in caudate nucleus suggesting that the feline neostriatum is not a homogeneous structure .
7076543|In the neostriatum , scattered fibre bundles of the internal capsule frequently contained ependymoglial fibres which may act as a skeleton for guiding developing axons to their appropriate destinations .
7076893|These features for granule cells are similar to those for medium-sized spiny neurons in the neostriatum .

7096628|Cytoarchitectonic heterogeneity of the primate neostriatum : subdivision into Island and Matrix cellular compartments .
7096628|Therefore , according to present observations the neostriatum in primates should be viewed as a cytoarchitectonically heterogeneous structure composed of at least two distinct cellular compartments with specific connectivity .
7096628|These compartments may be related to the histochemical and functional diversity of the neostriatum .

7117440|Therefore , the data analyzed in this study support the view that the geometry of large cell-medium cell clusters is extremely stable in the mouse neostriatum and seems not to be influenced either by age of the animal or by location of the cell grouping .

7155350|The relationship of the neostriatum intermedium field to avian motor pathways is discussed and it is suggested that nucleus dorsointermedius posterior thalami of birds may play a role comparable to that of the mammalian ventral tier nuclei in the neural control of motor functions .

7172034|The glyoxylic acid fluorescence technique was applied to the study of catecholamine fibres in the caudate-putamen -LRB- neostriatum -RRB- of control and experimental adult rats .
7172034|However , some regions differed from the ordinary fluorescence of the neostriatum by their stronger intensity and more visible varicosities .
7172034|Therefore , restricted electrolytic lesions of the substantia nigra pars compacta were undertaken in order to study the morphology of the remaining catecholaminergic fibres in the ipsilateral neostriatum .

7230050|Precise knowledge of the ultrastructural features and interneuronal relationships of dopaminergic -LRB- DA -RRB- axon terminals or varicosities in neostriatum is still lacking .
7230050|In this context , histological processing of the central nervous system by vascular perfusion , tested in adult rats subjected to prolonged lateroventricular instillation of -LSB- 3H -RSB- DA , led to the following results and conclusions : 1 Axonal varicosities having accumulated -LSB- 3H -RSB- DA in vivo may be detected in great number in the ipsilateral paraventricular neostriatum -LRB- Figs. 1 B and 1 C -RRB- .
7230050|2 The specificity of this radioautographic labelling is evidenced by : -LRB- a -RRB- its disappearance or persistance , depending on the addition of a high concentration of non-radioactive noradrenaline or serotonin to the -LSB- 3H -RSB- DA solution -LRB- Fig. 1 C -RRB- ; -LRB- b -RRB- the absence of labelled axonal varicosities in the supraependymal region -LRB- Figs. 2 E and 2 F -RRB- and suprachiasmatic nucleus -LRB- Fig. 1 E to be compared with 1 F -RRB- after administration of -LSB- 3H -RSB- DA alone ; -LRB- c -RRB- the absence of any localized accumulation of -LSB- 3H -RSB- DA in neostriatum following prior destruction of the nigro-striatal DA system by 6-hydroxydopamine -LRB- Fig. 1 D -RRB- .

7230052|In the present study , a double approach , both electrophysiological and biochemical , was used to investigate the possible role of the peptide A II in the neostriatum of the rat .
7230052|1 Microiontophoretic application of A II was shown to modify the spontaneous activity of some neurones -LRB- 15/68 -RRB- in the neostriatum .
7230052|These results suggest that there are angiotensin-containing nerve endings in the neostriatum , and that the cell bodies of such nerves are located outside this structure .
7236348|Evidence is found that the neostriatum , especially the neostriatal , dopaminergic activity determines the animal 's ability to select the best strategy in a stressful situation by modifying the process of switching strategies under pressure of factors intrinsic to the organism : neither sensory neglect nor inability to initiate voluntary movements underlay the observed phenomena .
7236348|It is suggested that the neostriatum determines the individual flexibility to cope with available sensory information .
7237126|Phenomena consistent with postsynaptic supersensitivity developed in the rat neostriatum following the destruction of dopaminergic afferent neurons .
7237126|Elimination of dopamine-containing nerve endings in the neostriatum was accompanied by the gradual development of an increase in dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity in homogenates of the caudate ipsilateral to the lesion as compared to the contralateral side .
7237126|The increase in the density of dopamine receptors and in a receptor-mediated function may partially account for the development of enhanced electrophysiological responses to dopamine agonists in the neostriatum .

7240442|Among neurons of types 3 and 4 ; the axons of short-axon neurons and of microneurons end with fine branches within the auditory neostriatum .
7240442|In the region of the auditory neostriatum that lies immediately adjacent to the midline of the brain , the first three types of neurons are arranged around the central core known as field L , which is composed of the microneurons and the terminal ramifications of auditory afferents .
7240442|Laterally the microneurons , along with the fibers of the input tract , undergo a rostral shift to occupy a more peripheral position within the auditory neostriatum .
7240442|The neurons of the auditory neostriatum are compared with those of the mammalian auditory cortex , and a functional classification of nerve cells into projection neurons , association neurons , and interneurons is proposed .

7248057|The histological analysis suggested that kainic acid does permit the selective lesioning of cell bodies in the neostriatum , whilst sparing fibres of passage .
7248057|It was concluded that the results demonstrate functional heterogeneity within the neostriatum of rats , in direct agreement with the predictions of the ` prefrontal systems ' hypothesis of Rosvold -LSB- 48 , 49 -RSB- .

7256286|Despite the common somato-dendritic morphology of the neostriatal projection neurons , two different distribution patterns of efferent axons were observed , indicating the presence of functionally different medium spiny neurons in the neostriatum .
72587|Light and electron microscopic observation 3 -- 4 days after microinjection of Herpes simplex virus -LRB- HSV -RRB- into the left neostriatum of rat demonstrated the following results .

7276247|Donoghue JP , Kitai ST. A projection from large pyramidal cells in layer V of the rat somatic sensory-motor -LRB- SSM -RRB- cortex both to the neostriatum and the brainstem was demonstrated by intracellular recording and injection of horseradish peroxidase -LRB- HRP -RRB- .
7276247|Beyond the cortex , the main axon has no collateral branches , except for a single laterally directed branch in the neostriatum .
7276247|It is concluded that these branched cells provided a parallel input to the neostriatum and to brainstem or spinal motor centers .

7291220|A naturally occurring diamine , cadaverine , and one of its acyl derivatives , monopropionylcadaverine , were tested for their effects on the in vitro release of endogenous dopamine from slices of the rat neostriatum .
7291231|Bilateral injections of PRL -LRB- 10 micrograms/l microliters -RRB- in the neostriatum failed to induce grooming , whereas bilateral injections of peptide into the substantia nigra -LRB- 1 microgram/0 .5 micrograms -RRB- elicited the behavioral response .
7291267|Blood and brain levels were markedly increased at 15 days in exposed animals ; by 35 days blood lead levels had decreased 90 % while lead level in neostriatum decreased only 55-60 % .

Muscarinic receptors , labeled with -LSB- 3H -RSB- quinuclidinyl benzylate -LRB- -LSB- 3H -RSB- QNB -RRB- , and acetylcholinesterase activity were studied in five areas of the developing chick brain : -LRB- 1 -RRB- hyperstriatum and neostriatum , -LRB- 2 -RRB- paleostriatum , -LRB- 3 -RRB- optic lobes , -LRB- 4 -RRB- mesodiencephalon and -LRB- 5 -RRB- cerebellum .
7346581|Prenatal formation of cortical input and development of cytoarchitectonic compartments in the neostriatum of the rhesus monkey .
7346581|The timing , hemispheric laterality , and mode of termination of input from the prefrontal association cortex to the neostriatum were studied in fetal and neonatal rhesus monkeys using autoradiography for tracing connections .
7346581|In addition , the cytological maturation of the neostriatum was examined in Nissl-stained sections from the same and other monkeys of selected prenatal and postnatal ages .
7346581|Throughout this period , ipsilateral perfrontostriatal connections predominate , and only a small and variable amount of label is detectable over the contralateral neostriatum .
7346581|A major feature of the developing corticostriatal projection is a transfiguration in the distribution of its terminals : from E69 to E95 , cortical terminals are distributed uniformly among neostriatal neurons ; beginning around E105 , areas of higher and lower grain density begin to emerge until finally , by E133 , 250 - to 500-micrometers-wide circular and elliptically shaped label-free cores perforate a field of densely labeled cortical terminals as in the neostriatum of the adult monkey -LRB- Goldman , P. S. , and W. J. H. Nauta -LRB- 1977 -RRB- J. Comp .
7346581|The cytoarchitectonic composition of the neostriatum also changes during gestation : from E69 through E95 , the small postmitotic neurons of the immature neostriatum are packed densely and , for the most part , are distributed homogeneously ; by E105 , they become segregated into cellular islands consisting of densely packed neurons that are encapsulated by fiber-rich annuli and embedded in a matrix of less densely arrayed neurons .
7346581|Thus , the formation of the corticostriatal projection in primates involves a transformation in the distribution of ingrowing terminals synchronized with changes in cellular organization of the neostriatum .

7374912|A comparative quantitative and morphological study of ageing in the mouse neostriatum , indusium griseum and anterior commissure .
7374912|The glia : neuron ratio increased between 5 and 9 months in the neostriatum and indusium griseum and thereafter remained constant until 18 months-of-age .
7374912|Between 18 and 22 months the glia : neuron ratio did not change in the neostriatum , but increased significantly in the indusium griseum due to a combination of a loss of neurons and an increase in glia .
7374912|Astrocytes first contained lipofuscin at 6 months in the neostriatum , at 9 months in the indusium griseum and at 15 months in the anterior commissure .
7374912|Oligodendrocytes first contained lipofuscin at 12 months in the anterior commissure , at 18 months in the indusium griseum and at 18 months in the neostriatum .
7374912|Ependymal cells adjacent to the neostriatum contained lipofuscin and osmiophilic lipid at 6 months but by 12 months the latter had become much less osmiophilic .
7374912|Foamy pericytes were found in all regions : from 6 months in the neostriatum ; from 9 months in the indusium griseum and from 15 months in the anterior commissure .
737677|Distribution of catecholamines and acetylcholinesterase activity in the same cryotome section of rat 's neostriatum .
7378814|In the DA system , depletions are most pronounced in the neostriatum and substantia nigra , with decreased levels in these two regions being significantly correlated .
7378814|Within the 5-HT system , levels are most reduced in the amygdala , frontal cortex and neostriatum .
7381048|Prefrontal system in the rat visualized by means of labeled deoxyglucose -- further evidence for functional heterogeneity of the neostriatum .
7381048|The labeled formations were the posterior medial and perirhinal cortical areas , the anteromedial part of the neostriatum , the anterior and intermediodorsal part of globus pallidus , the entopeduncular nucleus , the reticular portion of the substantia nigra , the claustrum , and the basolateral nucleus of amygdala .
7381048|All these formations have previously been shown by neuro anatomical techniques to be directly connected with the anteromedial cortex of the neostriatum .
7381048|The present findings , in agreement with earlier neurobehavioral studies , indicate that , in the rat , the anteromedial part of the neostriatum , but not other neostriatal regions , is functionally related to the anteromedial part of the prefrontal cortex .
7388619|Recurrent inhibition in the rat neostriatum .
7388619|Park MR , Lighthall JW , Kitai ST. During intracellular recording , in the neostriatum of rats anesthetized with urethane , the triggering of an action potential in the recorded neuron by a depolarizing pulse of current resulted in inhibition in that same neuron .
7397550|Plasticity of -LSB- 14C -RSB- 2-deoxy-D-glucose incorporation into neostriatum and related structures in response to dopamine neuron damage and apomorphine replacement .
7397550|The incorporation of this glucose analog into the ipsilateral neostriatum , nucleus accumbens septi , olfactory tubercle , and central nucleus of amygdala is decreased relative to the contralateral hemisphere .
7397550|Concurrently , structures receiving projections from the neostriatum -LRB- globus pallidus , entopeduncular nucleus , and substantia nigra , pars reticulata -RRB- show enhanced labeling in the 6-hydroxydopamine-injected hemisphere , as do diencephalic structures receiving basal ganglia inputs -LRB- ventromedial nucleus and ventrolateral portion of the ventral anterolateral complex of thalamus , lateral portion of lateral habenular nucleus -RRB- .
7397550|Most of these 6-hydroxydopamine-induced asymmetries of -LSB- 14C -RSB- 2DG labelling are abolished or reversed by the injection of apomorphine i.p. -LRB- 0.25 mg/kg -RRB- or directly into the denervated neostriatum -LRB- 5 microgram -RRB- 7 -- 20 days postoperatively .

7398832|An in vitro slice technique was employed to study the receptors involved in intrinsic cholinergic excitation in the rat neostriatum .
7398832|Apparently rat neostriatum is similar to cholinergic systems in sympathetic ganglia and spinal Renshaw cells , in that nicotinic receptors mediate fast excitation and muscarinic receptors mediate slow excitation .
7400036|A developmental study of the mouse neostriatum .
7400036|The development of the mouse neostriatum was studied from 11 days postconception to 180 days postnatum in semithin sections , Golgi-stained sections and electron micrographs .
7400036|The neostriatum was first visible in 12 day embryos .
7402437|The neostriatum , indusium griseum and anterior commissure of the mouse brain were examined by semithin light microscopy and electron microscopy in an attempt to identify and follow the development of the cells named neurolipomastocytes by Ibrahim et al. -LRB- 1979 -RRB- .
7412872|In vivo electrochemical detection of catechols in the neostriatum of anaesthetized rats : dopamine or DOPAC ?
7412872|Lane et al. have been able to circumvent this problem , at least in part , by the application of differential pulse voltametry -LRB- DPV -RRB- to a surface-modified platinum electrode , obtaining distinct oxidation current peaks in recordings from the rat neostriatum which are attributed to AA and to dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- , respectively , but which are also unstable .
7412872|Moreover , pharmacological investigations suggest that the catecholamine peak measured in vivo in the rat neostriatum should be attributed to 3 , 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid -LRB- DOPAC -RRB- , suggesting that our technique may be a useful means of following dopaminergic activity in vivo .
7417786|Embryonic substantia nigra -LRB- SN -RRB- was transplanted to the neostriatum in adult rats subjected to a unilateral or serial bilateral destruction of the nigrostriatal dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- pathway .
7417786|The results show that large parts of the dorsal neostriatum can be reinnervated by DA-containing axons from the intracortical transplant and that this new DA input can fully compensate for the amphetamine-induced motor assymmetry that resulted from the initial destruction of the innate nigrostriatal DA pathway .
7417786|The fluorescence microscopical observations provide strong evidence that the compensation of the amphetamine-induced rotational response was specifically related to the re-establishment of a new DA input to the denervated neostriatum , and that the degree of rotational compensation was well correlated to the magnitude of ingrowth into the neostriatum .
7417786|It is concluded that SN transplants reinnervation the dorsal part of the neostriatum are able to replace the innate SN in normalizing some aspects of the rats motor behaviour , while their sensorimotor deficits and deficits in consummatory behaviour were unaffected .
7417786|It is suggested that this dissociation of transplant-induced recovery is due to the failure of the SN transplants to reinnervate those parts of the neostriatum which are most directly implicated in sensorimotor and consummatory behaviour .

7535117|Strongly stained neurones were concentrated in the paleostriatum augmentatum , lobus parolfactorius , ventral pallidum , olfactory tubercle , parts of the neostriatum , mesencephalic reticular formation and locus coeruleus .
7536234|In contrast , ZENK induction is much lower or absent in the archistriatum , the primary telencephalic sensory-recipient areas -LRB- including auditory field L -RRB- , and the three telencephalic androgen receptor-containing song nuclei -LRB- high vocal center , lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum , and the robust nucleus of the archistriatum -RRB- .
7536307|The human neostriatum shows compartmentalization of neuropeptide gene expression in dorsal and ventral regions : an in situ hybridization histochemical analysis .
7536307|The distribution of high-expressing prodynorphin messenger RNA-containing cells -- to the patch compartment and throughout the entire ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens region -- defines the limbic domain of the neostriatum and suggests particular relevance to human striatal organization and function , because the distribution of this opioid neuropeptide is considerably more compartmentalized in human than in non-human species .
7538606|Three classes of GABAergic interneurons in neocortex and neostriatum .
7538606|We have compared the cellular organization of GABAergic interneurons between frontal cortex and neostriatum of rats by immunohistochemistry for calcium-binding proteins , somatostatin and nitric oxide synthase -LRB- NOS -RRB- .
7538606|GABAergic interneurons in both neocortex and neostriatum could be divided into three separate populations containing parvalbumin , somatostatin , or calretinin .
7538606|Distributions of calbindin D28k in three classes of interneurons were different among neocortical layers and neostriatum .
7538769|These differential behavioral effects were paralleled by selective and site-specific changes in dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- activity , as both SP and its C - , but not N-terminus , increased extracellular DA in the nucleus accumbens -LRB- NAc -RRB- , but not in the neostriatum .
7539603|Developmental expression of KG-CAM in the rat neostriatum .
7539603|The present study examines the developmentally regulated expression pattern of an Ig superfamily member , KG-CAM , in the neostriatum of the rat .
7539603|In the embryonic and early postnatal neostriatum , the distribution of KG-CAM correlates with the distribution of dopaminergic terminals .
7539603|In the maturing neostriatum , the levels of KG-CAM remain high within the patches , and KG-CAM upregulates in the matrix compartment .
7539603|As the neostriatum is reaching its adult morphology , 5 weeks postnatal , the expression of KG-CAM in the matrix is approximately equal to that of the patches .
7539603|The present study identifies an Ig superfamily member , KG-CAM , that appears to play a major role in the development of the neostriatum .
7539603|Furthermore , the high levels of KG-CAM in the adult neostriatum suggest that this Ig superfamily member may be involved in maintaining the integrity of this structure in the adult rat .
7543300|wt of 3000 g mol-1 , a marker for the extracellular space , was injected unilaterally into the neostriatum of adult rats -LRB- 0.3-30 micrograms microliter-1 -RRB- and its distribution evaluated 1 min to 5 h later .
7543300|After 10-15 min strong labelling along the myelinated fibre bundles was observed in the entire neostriatum .
7566483|The local application of 8-OH-DPAT into serotonergic projection areas of the forebrain -LRB- dorso-lateral neostriatum , accumbens core ; 0.5 or 2.0 micrograms/side -RRB- did not affect raclopride-induced catalepsy .
7581553|-LSB- The chemical stability of enkephalin-like tetrapeptides in a cannula implanted in the rat neostriatum for multiple microinjections -RSB- .
7581566|-LSB- The morphochemical characteristics of the neurons of the sensorimotor cortex and neostriatum in rats with differing degrees of alcohol preference -RSB- .
7581575|The effects of microinjections of the cholinergic agonist -LRB- carbacholine -RRB- into the dorsal part of the neostriatum on discrimination processing of sensory signals were studied in chronic experiments in dogs -LRB- instrumental defensive reflex connected with maintenance of flexion posture -RRB- and in rats -LRB- active avoidance learning in T-maze -RRB- .
7581575|In both cases the neostriatum seems to be not involved in behavioral reaction what could be accompanied by low neuronal activity during the these signals action .
759223|After low i.p. doses -LRB- 50 mg/kg of body weight -RRB- the fluorescence was totally confined to the capillary endothelial cells in the cerebral cortex , neostriatum , and substantia nigra -LRB- Sn -RRB- .
759223|Ater injections to the neostriatum or SN fluorescence was observed in the endothelial cells and some small to medium-sized rounded cells in both regions .
759444|Kelley DB , Nottebohm F. Anterograde projections of a telencephalic auditory area - field L of the neostriatum - were traced in canaries , Serinus canarius .
759444|Using amino acid autoradiography , two efferent projections of field L and adjacent neostriatum were observed : -LRB- 1 -RRB- a projection to the medial and ventral borders of nucleus hyperstriatum ventrale , pars caudale -LRB- HVc -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- a smaller projection to medial paleostriatum augmentatum -LRB- PA -RRB- .
759444|When autoradiographic injection sites included neostriatum postero-ventral to field L , a projection to archistriatum outlining the anterior and ventral borders of the nucleus robustus archistriatalis -LRB- RA -RRB- resulted .
759444|Injection sites that included neostriatum antero-lateral to `` L '' gave rise to projections to the interior of HVc proper .
759444|Following lesion of field L and adjacent neostriatum , argyrophilic degeneration was traced to medial PA and to a shelf of neostriatum underlying HVc .
7599540|The dopaminergic projection from the substantia nigra to the neostriatum is vulnerable to several neurotoxins including 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1 ,2,3,6 - tetrahydropyridine -LRB- MPTP -RRB- , amphetamine , and 5-hydroxydopamine .
7603630|Auditory system nuclei containing axonal and terminal degeneration included the lateral mesencephalic nucleus , pars dorsalis , the nucleus ovoidalis , and area L of Rose in the caudal neostriatum .
7606489|The latter decreased UBDS in neocortex , and increased it in the septum , neostriatum , hypothalamus , cerebellum , and rest of the brain .
7609871|Immunoreactivity for both D1 and D2 receptors was most abundant in the neostriatum where it was mainly contained within spiny dendrites and in perikarya .
7609871|It is concluded that dopamine receptor immunoreactivity is mainly associated with spiny output neurons of the neostriatum and that there is a selective association of D1 receptors with the so-called direct pathway of information flow through the basal ganglia , i.e. the striatoentopeduncular and striatonigral pathways .
7612814|This paper models the behavior of dopamine released from a small iontophoresis electrode and its voltammetric detection by a carbon fiber sensor 100 microns away as a basis for developing a new paradigm for measuring dopamine kinetics in intact rat neostriatum .
7615877|In addition , the caudolateral neostriatum -LRB- NCL -RRB- , pyriform cortex , and hippocampal complex also give rise to striatal projections in pigeon .
7617303|Localization of catechol-O-methyltransferase -LRB- COMT -RRB- in rat cerebral cortex , neostriatum and cerebellar cortex was studied with preembedding immunoelectron microscopy using a specific antiserum raised against rat recombinant COMT protein .
7617682|It was shown that the CBA mice had the highest tryptophan hydroxylase activity in the neostriatum compared to mice of other noncataleptic strains .
7617682|The experience of repeated victories in intermale encounters producing highly aggressive CBA mice resulted in the inhibition of the genetically determined predisposition to pinch-induced catalepsy and in the simultaneous decrease of tryptophan hydroxylase activity in the neostriatum down to the level found in noncataleptic mice .
7617682|The inhibitor of tryptophan hydroxylase , p-chloromethamphetamine , significantly decreased the enzyme activity in the neostriatum of CBA mice and completely inhibited their genetically determined predisposition to catalepsy .
7630490|The activation of the cells of the centrum medianum of the thalamus was accompanied during the formation of an instrumental conditioned defense reflex by the formation of a pattern of impulse activity in neurons of the neostriatum which coincided in sign with the reorganizations which were characteristic during the investigation of the baseline activity .
7630491|Neurochemical characteristics of the rat neostriatum and motor cortex after the development of a unilateral manipulatory reflex .
7630491|Indicators of the activity of acetylcholinesterase -LRB- ACE -RRB- , 5 ' - nucleotidase -LRB- NT -RRB- , adenylate cyclase -LRB- AC -RRB- in the sensorimotor cortex and the neostriatum -LRB- NS -RRB- of the right and left cerebral hemispheres of control rats and rats trained to perform a food-procuring movement by pressing against an obstacle with the forelimb .
7630492|The hypothesis is advanced that dopamine exerts a protective inhibitory influence on the conduction of corticofugal glutamatergic impulse activity to neurons of the neostriatum .
7630502|The data obtained confirm the current hypothesis regarding the important role of the enkephalinergic system of the neostriatum in the regulation of complex forms of behavior and its close functional association with the dopaminergic system .
7632898|Nucleus interface -LRB- Nif -RRB- is a song bird vocal control nucleus located in the neostriatum .
7637873|Such a dopaminergic lesion also abolishes a functional equilibrium between dopaminergic and cholinergic transmissions , generally believed to operate within the neostriatum , which constitutes the theoretical basis for the clinical use of antimuscarinic drugs in extrapyramidal diseases .
7637873|Using quantitative in situ hybridization histochemistry , messenger RNAs were analysed at two rostrocaudal levels -LRB- anterior and central -RRB- of the neostriatum .
7637873|In 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats , the expected changes in messenger RNAs were observed when ipsi - versus contralateral side values were compared , but changes were not always detected when comparison was established between values from the dopamine-denervated neostriatum and those from sham-operated rats .
7637873|The trihexyphenidyl administration in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned animals was unable to reproduce the up-regulation of M1 receptors , even in the intact neostriatum .
7637873|This antimuscarinic treatment further increased preproenkephalin messenger RNA levels in the denervated anterior neostriatum , amplifying the ipsi - versus contralateral difference .
7637873|It also potentiated the imbalance in preprotachykinin messenger RNA expression , mainly as a result of an increase of preprotachykinin messenger RNA levels in the intact neostriatum .
7637873|These results question the neostriatum as the site of action of antimuscarinic drugs in producing their therapeutic effect in extrapyramidal syndromes .
7637895|The effects of a focal lesion induced by endothelin-1 -LRB- ET-1 , 0.8 microgram/0 .8 microliter -RRB- on superoxide dismutase -LRB- SOD -RRB- were studied in the neostriatum of male rats .
7637895|ET-1 caused a large lesion -LRB- 9.20 + / - 1.32 mm3 -RRB- in the neostriatum 24 h after the injection that was 3-fold greater than that observed 1 h after .
7643077|In one brain region necessary for song learning , the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- IMAN -RRB- , NMDA receptor binding is twice as high at the onset of song learning as in adulthood .
7643078|In the robust nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- RA -RRB- , these sex differences develop because more neurons die in young females than in males .
7643078|In particular , since sexual differentiation of the RA parallels the development of dimorphisms in the numbers of neurons providing afferent input from the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- IMAN -RRB- and the high vocal center -LRB- HVC -RRB- , it has been hypothesized that sex differences in the size of these afferent populations trigger differential RA neuron survival and growth .
7648259|The in vitro and in vivo effects of -LRB- - -RRB- - nicotine on dopamine D2 receptors in the rat neostriatum have been studied using biochemical binding , in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry .
7648259|No significant change was observed in tyrosine hydroxylase -LRB- TH -RRB- immunoreactivity in either the substantia nigra or the neostriatum , nor in nigral TH mRNA levels during the time interval studied -LRB- 4-24 h posttreatment -RRB- .
7649231|TUNEL + neurons were found in Grade 1-4 HD neostriatum , while labeled astrocytes were found predominantly in the Grade 1 and 2 cases studied to date .
7650530|These findings indicate a selective impairment in KYNA biosynthesis in the neostriatum of HD patients , possibly due to the loss of -LRB- an -RRB- endogenous KAT activator -LRB- s -RRB- .
7650755|Mesencephalic cultures contain two morphologically different tyrosine hydroxylase -LRB- TH -RRB- - immunoreactive -LRB- IR -RRB- neurons , fusiform bipolar , and pyramidal multipolar , which project to different anatomical structures -LRB- ventral striatum and neostriatum -RRB- .
7656421|The persistence of morphological features of neurons in slice cultures of the imprinting-relevant forebrain area MNH -LRB- mediorostral neostriatum and hyperstriatum ventrale -RRB- of the domestic chick was analysed at 7 , 14 , 21 and 28 days in vitro .
7658201|We investigated the development of spiny neurons in the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum before , during , and after song learning in male zebra finches -LRB- Taeniopygia guttata -RRB- .
7659290|The present investigation assessed the effect of chronic blockade of kainate/quisqualate binding sites with 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2 ,3 - dione -LRB- CNQX -RRB- on preproenkephalin -LRB- PPE -RRB- and preprotachykinin -LRB- PPT -RRB- mRNA abundance in the neostriatum of the rat brain .
7659290|The data demonstrate that non-NMDA receptor activity modulates basal levels of expression of PPE and PPT mRNAs in the neostriatum of the rat brain .
7659761|This analysis was performed dependent on the degree of the lesion , classified post-mortem with respect to the level of residual DA in the neostriatum : < 20 % , 20-45 % , 45-65 % , and > 65 % -LRB- as percentage of the intact hemisphere -RRB- .
7663886|Putative pathological and physiological mechanisms underlying the observed differences in teh neostriatum are discussed .
7669699|It was found that after localized intracerebral injection of a cholinergic antagonist into the dorso-lateral -LRB- but not medial -RRB- neostriatum -LRB- i.e. , the caudato-putamen -RRB- the behavioral performance requiring brief innate movements remained unchanged , but the performance requiring a prolonged pushing movement -LRB- > 50 msec -RRB- became disrupted .
7680912|We have studied by quantitative in situ hybridization histochemistry the mRNA expression of the growth associated phosphoprotein -LRB- GAP-43 -RRB- in grafts of foetal striatal neurones implanted into the ibotenic acid lesioned adult rat neostriatum .
7681719|Selective resistance of tachykinin-responsive cholinergic neurons in the quinolinic acid lesioned neostriatum .
7682144|In order to identify a possible role for the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway in determining at least some aspects of the IDPN-induced dyskinetic syndrome , we used the neurotoxin , 1-methyl , 4-phenyl ,1,2,3,6 - tetrahydropyridine -LRB- MPTP -RRB- , as a tool for investigating which aspects of the IDPN-related syndrome could be due to enhanced dopaminergic activity in the neostriatum .
7682182|Morphological changes in the rat neostriatum after unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine injections into the nigrostriatal pathway .
7682182|After a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine injection into the medial forebrain bundle , Golgi-impregnated medium-sized spiny neurons in the neostriatum ipsilateral to the injection had a lower density of spines on their dendrites than those on the contralateral side .
7683144|Molecular alterations in the neostriatum of human cocaine addicts .
7683144|Molecular changes in the neostriatum of human subjects who died with a history of cocaine abuse were revealed in discrete cell populations by means of the techniques of in situ hybridization histochemistry and in vitro receptor binding and autoradiography .
7686081|Peripherally administered substance P affects extracellular dopamine concentrations in the neostriatum but not in the nucleus accumbens under anesthesia .
7686081|The in situ microdialysis technique was used in urethane-anesthetized rats to monitor changes in the extracellular concentrations of dopamine and its metabolites in neostriatum and nucleus accumbens after the peripheral administration of substance P -LRB- 50 or 250 micrograms/kg , IP -RRB- .
7686081|The administration of substance P induced a decrease in extracellular concentration of dopamine in neostriatum .
7690049|Intensely stained neurons and fibers were found in most parts of the telencephalon , in particular in the neostriatum , paleostriatum augmentatum , olfactory tubercle , lobus parolfactorius , hyperstriatum accessorium , and hyperstriatum ventrale .
7691003|The postsynaptic effects of dopamine in the neostriatum are mediated by five G-protein-coupled receptors .
7691003|This conclusion has important implications for parallel processing models of the neostriatum .
7691083|Here we show that the glial expression of these ECM constituents in a target region -LRB- the caudate-putamen or neostriatum -RRB- may be affected by the presence or absence of an appropriate , maturing afferent projection -LRB- in this case , dopaminergic nigrostriatal axons -RRB- .
7692449|Neuromodulatory actions of dopamine in the neostriatum are dependent upon the excitatory amino acid receptor subtypes activated .
7692449|In the mammalian neostriatum , dopamine modulates neuronal responses mediated by activation of excitatory amino acid receptors .
7692449|These results indicate that the complex modulatory actions of dopamine in the neostriatum are a function of the excitatory amino acid receptor as well as the specific dopamine receptor subtype activated .
7693897|Physiological , morphological , and histochemical characterization of three classes of interneurons in rat neostriatum .
7693897|Interneurons in lateral part of neostriatum were studied in isolated slices from juvenile rats -LRB- 16-20 d postnatal -RRB- by whole-cell , current-clamp recording at 33-34 degrees C , followed by intracellular staining with biocytin and double immunocytochemical or histochemical staining for parvalbumin , ChAT , and NADPH diaphorase .
7693897|As all parvalbumin-immunoreactive cells in the neostriatum were also immunoreactive for GABA , FS cells were considered to be GABAergic .
7696621|We used immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against the novel protein striatal enriched phosphatase -LRB- STEP -RRB- to investigate the internal organization of grafts of embryonic striatal tissues implanted in the ibotenic acid-lesioned neostriatum of adult rats .
7703408|Rats subjected to unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion of the pars compacta of the substantia nigra sustained a wide range of dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- loss in the neostriatum .
7703408|This finding indicates that dopamine denervation of the neostriatum disrupts sensory/motor integration and attentional processes rather than motor activation .
7703425|The expression of mRNA coding for the long -LRB- D2L -RRB- and short -LRB- D2S -RRB- isoforms of the dopamine D2 receptor was measured by in situ hybridization histochemistry in embryonic striatal tissue grafts implanted into the ibotenic acid-lesioned neostriatum of adult rats .
7703425|In the adult neostriatum each mRNA isoform exhibited a strong lateral-to-medial gradient in expression in terms of both the number of expressing cells and the hybridization signal -LRB- grain density -RRB- per cell .
7703425|In contrast to the situation in the intact neostriatum the striatal grafts contained significantly greater numbers of cells expressing D2S mRNA ; however , similar to the findings in the intact striatum the mRNA signal per cell was significantly greater than that for D2L mRNA .
7703425|These results indicate that the D2 receptor isoforms are differentially expressed in mature striatal tissue grafts , and suggest that the dopamine regulation of striatal grafts via D2 signal transduction mechanisms may be similar to that observed in the normal neostriatum .
7707040|We measured volumes of area X , the higher vocal center -LRB- HVC -RRB- , and the robust nucleus of the archistriatum -LRB- RA -RRB- ; measured soma sizes in the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the neostriatum -LRB- lMAN -RRB- , HVC , and RA ; and counted RA neurons .
7707043|Concentrations of cAR mRNA are detectable in several of the song control nuclei of the forebrain , including high vocal center -LRB- HVC -RRB- , lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum and robust nucleus of the archistriatum .
7712186|Quantification of the serotonin hyperinnervation in adult rat neostriatum after neonatal 6-hydroxydopamine lesion of nigral dopamine neurons .
7712186|Light microscope autoradiography after uptake and storage of tritiated serotonin -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- in brain slices was used to count 5-HT axon terminals -LRB- varicosities -RRB- in the 5-HT-hyperinnervated neostriatum of adult rats subjected to neonatal 6-hydroxydopamine treatment and age-matched , normal controls .
7712186|Control values ranged from 4.8 in the rostral to 6.3 in the caudal neostriatum -LRB- 5.8 at intermediate level -RRB- , for an average of 5.6 .
7712186|The corresponding values in 5-HT-hyperinnervated tissue ranged from 9.7 to 7.7 -LRB- 8.8 at intermediate level -RRB- , for an average of 8.7 and increases of 102 % , 52 % and 22 % above control in the rostral , intermediate and caudal neostriatum , respectively -LRB- average increase of 55 % -RRB- .
7712186|These data confirmed the predilection of the 5-HT hyperinnervation for the rostral neostriatum and demonstrated its presence in the caudal neostriatum also .
7723620|Five days later , a suspension containing embryonic dopaminergic neurones was injected in the lesioned neostriatum .
7723620|Density of D1 receptors was not affected by the lesion while D2 receptors density was increased by 20-25 % in the more rostral part of the neostriatum .
7723620|Changes in D2 mRNA after the lesion paralleled those observed for D2 receptor density , i.e. D2 mRNA level was increased by 15-19 % in the rostral neostriatum .
7723628|PTHrP gene expression was highest in the supramamillary nucleus of the hypothalamus , medial superior olivary nucleus , and in subpopulations of cells in the neostriatum , hippocampus , and cerebral cortex .
7724573|The present study used light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry to characterize the distribution of two PP1 isoforms , PP1 alpha and PP1 gamma 1 , in the rat neostriatum .
7724573|Both isoforms are heterogeneously distributed in brain with the highest immunoreactivity being found in the neostriatum and hippocampal formation .
7724575|Earlier work showed that playbacks of conspecific song induce expression of the immediate early gene ZENK in the caudo-medial neostriatum -LRB- NCM -RRB- of awake male zebra finches and that this response disappears with repeated presentations of the same stimulus .
7725247|MK-801 administration prevented methamphetamine-induced depletion of 5-hydroxytryptophan -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- terminals in the forebrain and depletion of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive dopaminergic terminals and astrocytic response in the neostriatum in most animals .
7725247|A minor depletion of TH-positive terminals and astrogliosis in the neostriatum was seen in three of nine MA-MK-801-treated animals .
772720|Studies on the cholinergic and dopaminergic innervation of the neostriatum with the help of intraneostriatal injections of drugs .
7728332|Ventral mesencephalic grafts in the neostriatum of the weaver mutant mouse : structural molecule and receptor studies .
7728332|Mesencephalic cell suspensions were prepared from E12 wild-type -LRB- + / + -RRB- mouse embryos and stereotaxically implanted into the dorsal neostriatum of weaver mutant mice -LRB- wv/wv -RRB- , which have a genetic mesostriatal dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- deficiency .
7731548|Effect of locally infused 2-chloroadenosine , an A1 receptor agonist , on spontaneous and evoked dopamine release in rat neostriatum .
7751945|In the neostriatum of individuals with HD , patterns of distribution of TUNEL-positive neurons and glia were reminiscent of those seen in apoptotic cell death during normal development of the nervous system ; in the same areas , nonrandom DNA fragmentation was detected occasionally .
7751945|However , the distribution of dying neurons in the neostriatum , the degree of glial degeneration , and the involvement of striatofugal pathways are very different between HD and excitotoxically damaged striatum .
7755884|Nevertheless , striatal grafts have been found to alleviate cognitive and motor deficits after excitotoxic lesions of the neostriatum .
7761463|It has been shown that the anterior forebrain pathway sequentially connects the following nuclei : the high vocal center , area X of lobus parolfactorius , the medial portion of the dorsolateral thalamic nucleus , the lateral magnocellular nucleus of anterior neostriatum -LRB- IMAN -RRB- , and the robust nucleus of the archistriatum -LRB- RA -RRB- .
7773693|Multisensory convergence and integration in the neostriatum and globus pallidus of the rat .
7777146|Reflection of internal and external determinants of behavior in the neuronal activity of the neostriatum of monkeys .
7777146|It has been demonstrated that some neurons of the neostriatum of monkeys -LRB- Macaca nemestrina -RRB- participate in supporting the reaction of the animal to the appearance of standard situations in which a decision is made on the basis of already existing skills .
7777147|Influence of the blockade of D2 dopamine receptors of the cat neostriatum on the baseline activity and saccadic eye movement-associated reactions of neurons of the reticular portion of the substantia nigra .
7777147|The identified changes are regarded as a result of the disinhibition of GABAergic neurons of the reticular portion of the substantia nigra under the influence of the blockade of D2 dopamine receptors of the neostriatum .
7777150|Data have been obtained in chronic experiments on 34 dogs , based on an instrumental defense reflex model associated with the maintenance of a specific posture , which suggest that activation of the cholinergic system of the neostriatum leads to a large number of changes in both the sensory and the motor spheres .
7777150|The influences on sensory mechanisms , observed both through ipsi - and contralateral effects on the cholinergic system of the neostriatum , reside in an improvement of the differentiation of significant signals and are evidently through inhibition of the nonspecific afferent stream .
7777150|Data are presented on the important role of the cholinoreactive systems of the CM-Pf complex of the thalamus in the intensification of the cholinergic activity of the neostriatum .
7777152|Role of dopaminoreactive systems of the cortex and the neostriatum in the organization of situational conditioned reflexes .
7784896|To predicate the value of human fetal substantia nigra transplantation in clinical treatment of Parkinson 's disease -LRB- PD -RRB- , dissociated cells of substantia nigra from 8-12 week old abortive human fetus were grafted into the neostriatum of 5 adult rhesus monkeys with hemiparkinsonism induced by unilateral injection of MPTP .
7784896|Transplanted TH immunoreactive cells took a pattern of patches scattered in the neostriatum .
7784896|The TH immunoreactive fiber network was seen in the neostriatum .
7784896|The results suggest that DA neurons from 8-12 week old abortive human fetus are able to survive grafting into the neostriatum of monkey , a species phylogenetically very close to human , and to establish reciprocal synaptic connectivity with the host even at 2 months post-transplanting .
7784896|It is , therefore , inferable that embryonic human DA neurons transplanted into human neostriatum may have the same fate as in monkeys .
7792720|The ultrastructure of GABAergic and non-GABAergic synapses in the adult rat neostriatum was examined 6-8 months after unilateral removal of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway by 6-hydroxydopamine injection into the medial forebrain bundle .
7796094|The telencephalic song-control nuclei MAN -LRB- magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -RRB- , Area X of the striatum , HVC -LRB- higher vocal center -RRB- , and RA -LRB- robust nucleus of the archistriatum -RRB- contained abundant ENK immunoreactivity , including labeled fibers and somata .
7796094|Somata positive for VIP were not seen throughout cortical regions such as the neostriatum and hyperstriatum but were abundant in the lateral striatum -LRB- paleostriatum augmentatum , PA -RRB- and may contribute to a dense field of terminal labeling seen in the globus pallidus .
7796177|PKC gamma-stained cells were distributed widely in the telencephalon , including all hyperstriatal structures -LRB- including the IMHV -RRB- , the hippocampus , neostriatum , ectostriatum and archistriatum .
7796177|However , there was PKC alpha beta-staining of some fibres in the IMHV -LRB- but little elsewhere in the hyperstriatum ventrale -RRB- , in the neostriatum , paleostriatal complex and the lobus parolfactorius .
7803158|The tactile/trigeminal circuit consists of a pattern of reciprocal connections of the nucleus basalis with the overlying parts of the frontal neostriatum -LRB- Nf -RRB- and hyperstriatum ventrale -LRB- HV -RRB- .
7803158|A comparable pattern of visual connections has been found : the ectostriatum has reciprocal connections with the intermediate neostriatum -LRB- Ni -RRB- and HV .
7804832|The aim of the present experiment was to test whether : -LRB- i -RRB- the destruction of the dopaminergic meso-telencephalic pathway in neonatal rats induces an increase in the density of Neuropeptide Y immunoreactive -LRB- NPY-IR -RRB- neuronal perikarya within the denervated neostriatum ; -LRB- ii -RRB- embryonic dopaminergic neurons grafted into the neonatal neostriatum could block such an effect of the lesion .
7804832|This increase was abolished in the neostriatum bearing dopaminergic grafts as evaluated six weeks after grafting .
7807587|G-protein gamma 7 subunit is selectively expressed in medium-sized neurons and dendrites of the rat neostriatum .
7807587|Northern blotting and in situ hybridization reveal that the gamma 7 subunit mRNA is expressed primarily in medium-sized neurons of the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens and neurons of the olfactory tubercle , and at low levels in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation and laminae II-III , and V of the neocortex .
7807587|The gamma 7 mRNA is translocated into dendrites of neurons in the neostriatum and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus .
7809051|A brain nucleus that is important for the generation of song in the adult male zebra finch -LRB- Poephila guttata -RRB- , the robust nucleus of the archistriatum -LRB- RA -RRB- , receives dual inputs from two other telencephalic song nuclei : the hyperstriatum ventrale pars caudale -LRB- HVc -RRB- and the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- L-MAN -RRB- .
7814666|In particular , archistriatum , anterior neostriatum , and the hippocampus had most of their neurons labeled before hatching .
7815073|During the first years of symptomatic Huntington 's disease -LRB- HD -RRB- , no readily apparent pathology is seen in the neostriatum at autopsy .
7816935|Thus , amphetamine , GBR-12909 , apomorphine , and the combined administration of D1 and D2 agonists all facilitate ascorbate release from glutamatergic terminals in the neostriatum , and this effect is blocked by dopamine receptor antagonists .
7816935|Even though the neostriatum itself contains a high concentration of dopamine receptors , the critical site for dopamine-mediated ascorbate release in the neostriatum is the substantia nigra .
7816935|Ascorbate also appears to modulate glutamatergic transmission in the neostriatum .
7817838|In the postero-dorso-lateral neostriatum -LRB- PDLNS -RRB- of the pigeon we found a high density of tyrosine hydroxylase and perineuronal nests of fibres labelled with anti-dopamine antibody .
7820106|In Quiver , the NA content in neostriatum and thalamus , and the 5-hydroxytryptamine content in neostriatum , paleostriatum and thalamus were significantly increased , in comparison with the normal quail .
7820633|The proximal dendrites of PV-positive neurons were smooth and often lay parallel to the border between the GP and the neostriatum .
7822489|Because parvalbumin-positive neurones are present in regions known to project to the caudate-putamen and the majority of parvalbumin-positive terminals in the matrix formed asymmetric synapses , it is concluded that the uneven staining is probably due to afferents of the neostriatum .
7824182|PEC-60 increases dopamine but not GABA release in the dorsolateral neostriatum of the halothane anaesthetized rat .
7824562|The day after pilocarpine injections , rats were sacrificed and samples of tissue from the lateral neostriatum were removed to assess muscarinic receptor binding using 3H-QNB as the ligand .
7828004|Iron staining in the SN zona reticularis was modestly increased after 6-OHDA lesions , but staining in the neostriatum and globus pallidus was unaffected .
7830059|Dopamine receptor blockade inhibits the amphetamine-induced release of diadenosine polyphosphates , diadenosine tetraphosphate and diadenosine pentaphosphate , from neostriatum of the conscious rat .
7830888|Temporal changes in the messenger RNA levels of cellular immediate early genes and neurotransmitter/receptor genes in the rat neostriatum and substantia nigra after acute treatment with eticlopride , a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist .
7830888|The cellular immediate early genes are involved in the transcriptional events associated with the dopaminergic regulation of neurotransmitter expression within neurons of the neostriatum .
7830888|In the neostriatum , eticlopride caused a rapid increase in c-fos messenger RNA with significantly increased levels at 10 min -LRB- P < 0.01 -RRB- .
7830888|In the dorsolateral neostriatum , there was an increase in proneurotensin messenger RNA 10 min after eticlopride , this increase becoming significant -LRB- P < 0.01 -RRB- at 60 min .
7830890|Microinjection of carbachol -LRB- 109 nmol -RRB- in the caudal portions of the substantia nigra pars compacta induced contralateral circling associated with an increase of dopamine release in neostriatum .
7830890|We conclude that the cholinergic input to the substantia nigra pars compacta could modulate the motor behavior through regulating the firing rate of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and dopamine release in the neostriatum .
7831419|Clozapine -LRB- 3.8-60 .0 mumol kg-1 -RRB- did not produce any alterations in DOPA accumulation -LRB- following inhibition of cerebral aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase -RRB- in the prefrontal cortex or in three regions of the neostriatum , i.e. the ventral , the dorso-lateral and the posterior regions , in the rat .
7831419|Raclopride -LRB- 0.08-20 .0 mumol kg-1 -RRB- produced a marked increase in DOPA accumulation in all four brain regions and an increase in 5-HTP accumulation in the dorso-lateral neostriatum -LRB- 2.5-20 .0 mumol kg-1 -RRB- , but not in the other forebrain regions .
7831419|Treatment with SCH-23390 -LRB- 0.4-1 .6 mumol kg-1 -RRB- resulted in increased DOPA accumulation in the ventral and posterior parts of the neostriatum .
7838386|A short-lasting increase of basic fibroblast growth factor messenger RNA was observed in he ipsilateral pars reticulata of the substantia nigra -LRB- from 4-24 h , 300 % of control -RRB- and neostriatum -LRB- 24 h , 180 % of control -RRB- as well as in the ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampus and neocortex -LRB- by 4 h , 200 % of control -RRB- .
7842282|The anatomical results indicate four circuits by which auditory information may influence the vocal motor system : -LRB- 1 -RRB- direct auditory thalamic projections from nucleus dorsomedialis posterior -LRB- DMP -RRB- to both the neostriatal higher vocal center -LRB- HVC -RRB- and robust archistriatal nucleus -LRB- RA -RRB- ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- direct projections from a neostriatal projection field of DMP -LRB- i.e. , MAN , the magnocellular nucleus of the neostriatum -RRB- to HVC and RA ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- projections from DMP and other ` accessory ' auditory thalamic nuclei to the ventral paleostriatum -LRB- VP -RRB- , which in turn projects to MAN and RA ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- projections to HVC from the lateral hyperstriatum ventrale -LRB- HV -RRB- , which receives input from nucleus basalis -LRB- Bas -RRB- as well as from the oval nucleus of the HV -LRB- HVo -RRB- , which receives direct input from RA .
7842282|Lesions centered in either the primary auditory neostriatum -LRB- Field L2a -RRB- or the neostriatal area in receipt of Field L input -LRB- the ventrolateral neostriatum intermedium or NIVL -RRB- did not affect vocalization in juvenile or adult budgerigars .
7842284|A similar pattern of connectivity exists for neostriatum adjacent to HVc .
7842286|The finding that lesions of the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum or area X affect song development in young birds but not the maintenance of song in adults suggested a role of the anterior forebrain pathway to RA in song learning .
7844254|Anterograde projections from LPO were detected in the hyperstriatum , neostriatum , and paleostriatum .
7846544|HVc received projections from medial nucleus magnocellularis of the anterior neostriatum , nucleus interfacialis of midneostriatum , telencephalic auditory nucleus-field L , nucleus uvaeformis of the thalamus , and locus ceruleus of the pons .
7847863|In HD brains -LRB- grades 2-4 -RRB- , the distribution and levels of IT15 mRNA were comparable with controls in all areas except in neostriatum where the intensity of labeling was significantly reduced .
7850361|The caudate-putamen nucleus -LRB- neostriatum -RRB- is organized as a mosaic of two compartments that during development are cordoned off by astrocytes and associated glycoconjugates .
7850361|An hypothesis is presented that implicates glial cells , different classes of neurons , synaptic activity , and neurotoxicity in the shaping of normal cytoarchitectonic and connectional arrangements in the neostriatum .
7851507|The present study investigates whether rotation induced by 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the nigrostriatal bundle in rats is modified by additional lesions in the neostriatum .
7858317|High voltage electron microscopy -LRB- HVEM -RRB- and HVEM tomography of selectively stained cell processes in the neostriatum have offered an alternative to serial thin section reconstruction for accurate 3-D visualization and measurement of axons , dendrites , and dendritic spines .
7859063|Evidence for volume transmission in the dopamine denervated neostriatum of the rat after a unilateral nigral 6-OHDA microinjection .
7859063|In the present study the hypothesis has been tested if the dopamine releasing drug D-amphetamine via volume transmission can , at least partly , restore dopamine communication in the dopaminergically denervated neostriatum of rats .
7859063|Studies on c-fos like immunoreactivity after systemic D-amphetamine treatment demonstrated a wide-spread appearance of c-fos like immunoreactive neuronal nuclear profiles within the neostriatum on both the unlesioned and denervated side .
7859063|In the unlesioned neostriatum a peak density of c-fos like immunoreactive profiles was found within the central part of the neostriatum , while on the denervated side the distribution pattern of c-fos like immunoreactive profiles peaked medially and gradually declined in a lateral direction .
7859063|The microdialysis experiments demonstrated , after systemic d-amphetamine treatment , a marked and sustained increase of extracellular dopamine levels in the neostriatum on the unlesioned side , while no increases in the extracellular dopamine levels were observed on the dopaminergically denervated neostriatum .
7859063|The present immunocytochemical microdialysis and electrophysiological analysis provides evidence that in the unilaterally markedly dopamine depleted neostriatum with clearcut signs of dopamine receptor supersensitivity -LRB- rotational behaviour results -RRB- , dopamine transmission may be partly restored via systemic D-amphetamine treatment through the release of dopamine , predominantly from the unlesioned neostriatum , which may diffuse into the cerebrospinal fluid to reach the contralateral dopaminergically denervated neostriatum .
7860780|Immunoreactive nerve fibers were observed in the main and accessory olfactory bulbs , olfactory tubercle , prelimbic area , anterior cingulate cortex , neostriatum , accumbens , lateral septal nucleus , lateral habenular nucleus , and superior colliculus .
7860787|Both nuclei were found to have a major terminal field in the medial part of the ipsilateral neostriatum intermedium -LRB- NI -RRB- , known as nucleus interfacialis -LRB- NIf -RRB- in songbirds , and a minor terminal field in the roof of the neostriatum caudale -LRB- NC -RRB- .
7860787|In pigeon , the DLPc terminations in NC were within a region known as neostriatum dorsale -LRB- Nd -RRB- , and , in male songbirds , the Uva terminations were in the high vocal center -LRB- HVC -RRB- .
7862921|Repeated treatment with ascorbate or haloperidol , but not clozapine , elevates extracellular ascorbate in the neostriatum of freely moving rats .
7862921|Acute administration of neuroleptic drugs alters the extracellular level of ascorbate in the neostriatum , and increasing evidence suggests a role for this vitamin in the behavioral , and possibly therapeutic , effects of these drugs .
7862921|To shed further light on this issue , extracellular ascorbate was recorded in the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens of awake , behaving rats following chronic treatment with either classical -LRB- haloperidol -RRB- or atypical -LRB- clozapine -RRB- neuroleptics or ascorbate itself .
7862921|Repeated treatment with either haloperidol or ascorbate elevated basal extracellular ascorbate and potentiated the amphetamine-induced increase in ascorbate release in neostriatum but not nucleus accumbens .
7862921|In contrast , repeated clozapine had no effect on extracellular ascorbate in either neostriatum or nucleus accumbens , but increased the locomotor response to an amphetamine challenge .
7869118|In addition to cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain and neostriatum , trkA expression was found in noncholinergic neurons in -LRB- 1 -RRB- the paraventricular anterior and reuniens thalamic nuclei , -LRB- 2 -RRB- the rostral and intermediate subnuclei of the interpeduncular nucleus -LRB- IPN -RRB- , -LRB- 3 -RRB- scattered neurons in the ventrolateral and paramedian medulla , -LRB- 4 -RRB- the prepositus hypoglossal nucleus , and -LRB- 5 -RRB- the area postrema .

7870301|Synaptic input and output of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons in the neostriatum of the rat .
7870301|Previous studies have demonstrated that the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin , is located within a population of GABAergic interneurons in the neostriatum of the rat .
7870301|Furthermore , electrophysiological studies suggest that some GABAergic interneurons in the neostriatum receive direct excitatory input from the cortex and inhibit medium spiny cells following cortical stimulation .
7870301|Sections containing the neostriatum were treated for simultaneous localization of the transported tracer and parvalbumin immunoreactivity .
7870301|Tracer deposits in the cortex gave rise to massive terminal and fibre labelling in the neostriatum .
7870301|Areas of the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens containing retrogradely labelled neurons and parvalbumin-immunoreactive structures were selected for electron microscopy .
7874656|Once the role of the neostriatum in ritualistic behaviours has been clarified , the symptoms of OCD are interpreted based on the hypothesis of a lesion of the striato-orbito-frontal loop .
7881050|Sulphated cholecystokinin-8 -LRB- CCK-8 -RRB- given into the neostriatum of the rat by in vivo microdialysis produced a concentration-dependent -LRB- 1-100 microM -RRB- increase in extracellular aspartate -LRB- Asp -RRB- and dynorphin B -LRB- Dyn B -RRB- , but not in glutamate , GABA or dopamine levels .
7884457|Patterns of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the rat neostriatum as revealed by 4-AP .
7884457|This suggests that intrinsic inhibitory connections within the neostriatum are activated by 4-AP administration .
7884483|Surround inhibition among projection neurons is weak or nonexistent in the rat neostriatum .
7888093|We expected to find a dense degeneration of the dopamine terminals , but found instead that the main abnormality consisted of a focal vacuolation of the tissue , perhaps related to the striosome/matrix mosaic of the neostriatum .
7888146|Different effects of scopolamine on extracellular acetylcholine levels in neostriatum and nucleus accumbens measured in vivo : possible interaction with aversive stimulation .
7888146|The in vivo microdialysis technique was used to measure extracellular concentrations of acetylcholine -LRB- ACh -RRB- in the neostriatum -LRB- NS -RRB- and nucleus accumbens -LRB- NAc -RRB- of freely moving rats after intraperitoneal administration of the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine -LRB- 0.5 mg/kg -RRB- or vehicle .
788859|The results of this investigation are consistent with biochemical , pharmacological and physiological data which have indicated that neurons of the neostriatum and globus pallidus exert a GABA-mediated , postsynaptic inhibition upon the neurons of the substantia nigra .
7891110|After systemic salicylate , the ratio of total DHBA to salicylate in neostriatum was at least 10-fold higher than that observed after central salicylate .
7891110|A neurotoxic regimen of methamphetamine increased the concentration of DHBA in neostriatum after either central or systemic administration of salicylate .
7891129|The purpose of the present study was to examine whether cAMP-dependent mechanisms regulated excitatory synaptic transmission in the neostriatum .
7891129|These results suggest a role for tonic kinase and phosphatase activity in regulating excitatory synaptic transmission in the neostriatum .
7891129|Overall , these results suggest a role for the adenylate cyclase cascade in the regulation of excitatory synaptic transmission in the neostriatum .
7891855|Extracellular levels of dynorphin B were analysed with in vivo microdialysis in the neostriatum and substantia nigra of halothane-anaesthetized rats .
7891899|The data are compatible with a possible locus of action of memantine and amantadine in the neostriatum .
7892417|Chronic haloperidol treatment leads to an increase in the intramembrane interaction between adenosine A2 and dopamine D2 receptors in the neostriatum .
7892417|The present study was designed to examine if chronic treatment with haloperidol , which also produces dopamine receptor supersensitivity , is also associated with an increase in the intramembrane A2-D2 interaction in the neostriatum and with a higher sensitivity to the behavioural effects induced by adenosine antagonists .
7892958|Diffuse old ischemic necroses and neuronal loss with gliosis were found in the cortex , the neostriatum , the thalamus , parts of the lower brainstem , and the cerebellum .
7895027|These animals were assigned to different groups according to their residual DA levels in the damaged neostriatum -LRB- as percentage of the intact side -RRB- .
7895766|Selegiline was added to co-cultures of mesencephalon and neostriatum of C57BL/6 mouse embryos according to three schemes : -LRB- i -RRB- before and -LRB- ii -RRB- after cells were exposed to the toxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium -LRB- MPP + -RRB- , -LRB- iii -RRB- in control cultures .

7901337|Stress-induced dopamine release in the neostriatum : evaluation of the role of action potentials in nigrostriatal dopamine neurons or local initiation by endogenous excitatory amino acids .
7901337|It has been hypothesized that excitatory amino acids can initiate dopamine release in neostriatum .
7901337|We examined whether the increase in extracellular dopamine in neostriatum produced by acute stress reflects presynaptic initiation of dopamine release by endogenous excitatory amino acids .
7901337|Thirty minutes of intermittent tail-shock stress significantly elevated extracellular concentrations of dopamine , glutamate , aspartate , and gamma-aminobutyric acid in neostriatum of freely moving rats as measured with in vivo microdialysis .
7901337|Infusion of tetrodotoxin into medial forebrain bundle increased extracellular glutamate and aspartate in neostriatum yet reduced basal dopamine in extracellular fluid to below the limit of detection of the assay and eliminated the stress-induced increase in extracellular dopamine .
7901337|These findings fail to support the hypothesis that the stress-induced increase in extracellular dopamine in neostriatum is initiated locally by excitatory amino acids .
7902053|Dopamine is present in midbrain neurons projecting to the neostriatum , basal forebrain and cerebral cortex .
7903356|In the present study , extracellular levels of the neuropeptide cholecystokinin -LRB- CCK -RRB- , of the monoamine dopamine and its metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid -LRB- DOPAC -RRB- and homovanillic acid -LRB- HVA -RRB- , and of the excitatory amino acids glutamate and aspartate were simultaneously monitored by microdialysis in the neostriatum of halothane-anesthetized rats under basal and K -LRB- + -RRB- - depolarizing conditions .
7903903|It was possible to localize these changes in Na + , K -LRB- + -RRB- - ATPase activity into forebrain structures contained within the dorsal ventricular ridge comprising the hyperstriatum accessorium -LRB- HA -RRB- , hyperstriatum ventrale -LRB- HV -RRB- , hyperstriatum dorsale -LRB- HD -RRB- , and parts of neostriatum -LRB- N -RRB- .
7903903|In contrast , Na + , K -LRB- + -RRB- - ATPase activity in the ectostriatum -LRB- E -RRB- , the medial neostriatum -LRB- NM -RRB- , and the paleostriatal complex were unaffected .

7905031|Short - and long-term synaptic depression in rat neostriatum .
7905031|We have examined plasticity at glutamatergic synapses on neurons in slices of neostriatum , a forebrain area involved in movement and cognitive function .
7905031|Our findings indicate that glutamatergic synapses in neostriatum are capable of expressing a form of synaptic depression that may involve decreased glutamate release .
7906013|Changes of D1 and D2 receptors in adult rat neostriatum after neonatal dopamine denervation : quantitative data from ligand binding , in situ hybridization and iontophoresis .
7906013|The specific binding of -LSB- 3H -RSB- SCH23390 to D1 and of -LSB- 3H -RSB- raclopride to D2 dopamine receptors was measured by autoradiography in the rostral and caudal halves of neostriatum and in the substantia nigra of adult rats subjected to near total destruction of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons by intraventricular 6-hydroxydopamine soon after birth .
7906013|Three months after this lesion , -LSB- 3H -RSB- SCH23390 binding -LRB- D1 receptors -RRB- was slightly but significantly decreased in the rostral neostriatum -LRB- 22 % -RRB- , but unchanged in its caudal half and in the substantia nigra .
7906013|In contrast , -LSB- 3H -RSB- raclopride binding -LRB- D2 receptors -RRB- was considerably increased throughout the neostriatum -LRB- 10-40 % -RRB- , while markedly decreased in the substantia nigra -LRB- 80 % -RRB- .
7906013|In the rostral neostriatum , there were no parallel changes in D2 receptor messenger RNA levels , as measured by in situ hybridization on adjacent sections .
7906013|As assessed by quantitative iontophoresis , there was a marked enhancement -LRB- 63 % -RRB- of the inhibitory responsiveness of spontaneously firing units in the rostral neostriatum to dopamine and the D1 agonist , SKF38393 , in neonatally lesioned compared to control rats .
7906013|Such opposite changes in the number of D1 and D2 binding sites , dissociated from the expression of D2 receptor messenger RNA and from the sensitivity to dopamine and D1 and D2 agonists , suggested independent adaptations of these various parameters following the neonatal dopamine denervation of neostriatum .
7906013|They also provided further evidence for mechanisms other than the dopamine innervation in the control of the expression of neostriatal D2 receptor messenger RNA during ontogenesis , and emphasized that the effects of dopamine and its D1 and D2 agonists in neostriatum do not depend strictly on the number of D1 and D2 primary ligand recognition sites .
7906427|The characteristics of the modulations produced by these receptors provide a foundation for both antagonistic and synergistic actions of D1 and D2 agonists in the neostriatum .
7907169|The effects of megadose methylprednisolone and U-78517F on toxicity mediated by glutamate receptors in the rat neostriatum .
7907217|Cocultures from ventral mesencephalon and neostriatum of embryonic C57/BL6 mouse brains were used to study the sensitivity of dopaminergic neurons to the toxic agent MPP + .
7907524|Substance P receptor-immunoreactive neurons in the rat neostriatum are segregated into somatostatinergic and cholinergic aspiny neurons .
7907524|In the neostriatum , SPR immunoreactivity was detected in large and medium-sized aspiny neurons .
7907524|Virtually all SPR-immunoreactive neurons in the neostriatum contained somatostatin -LRB- SS -RRB- or choline acetyltransferase -LRB- ChAT -RRB- , but not parvalbumin .
7907524|All SS - and ChAT-immunoreactive neurons in the neostriatum showed SPR immunoreactivity .
7907548|Separate cell suspensions prepared from either eminence were stereotaxically implanted into excitotoxically lesioned neostriatum of adult rats .
7907549|The hrFGF-2 produced an astroglial reaction as determined in the lateral neostriatum and in the substantia nigra -LRB- SN -RRB- far from the site of the infusion , indicating that the growth factor may have reached these regions by diffusion to activate the astroglia .
7907614|The principle neuronal output of the neostriatum comes from medium spiny neurons that project from the caudate/putamen to the globus pallidus and substantia nigra .
7907614|Injections of -LSB- 3H -RSB- D-aspartate into the globus pallidus or substantia nigra , pars reticularis of the rat retrogradely labeled medium-sized neurons throughout the rostral-caudal extent of the neostriatum .
7909140|The high affinity uptake of D - -LSB- 3H -RSB- aspartate in synaptosomal fractions of the neostriatum , hippocampus , and neocortex was not significantly different in Fisher 344/Norwegian Brown hybrid rats aged 3 , 12 , 24 , and 37 months .
7909140|The potency of cyanide to inhibit D - -LSB- 3H -RSB- aspartate uptake did , however , display regional variability : hippocampus > neocortex > neostriatum -LRB- IC50 = 1.2 + / - 0.2 mM , 1.9 + / - 0.1 mM and 2.7 + / - 0.2 mM , respectively -RRB- , suggesting that EAA nerve terminals in the hippocampus may be selectively vulnerable to oxidative stress .
7909484|These results indicate a role for dopamine in the release of excitatory amino acids and glutamine in the neostriatum of the rat .
7909931|Solutions of rat albumin -LRB- 3 , 10 and 30 mg/ml -RRB- essentially free of fatty acids and globulins were injected into one neostriatum , physiological saline into the other .
7910464|Unilateral stimulation or removal of the vibrissae did not lead to significant changes in tissue levels of nerve growth factor in the neostriatum , parietal cortex -LRB- including the barrel cortex -RRB- or the hippocampus .
7910564|Binding of -LSB- 3H -RSB- L-aspartate to thaw-mounted coronal sections of frozen rat forebrain was strong in grey regions of telencephalon -LRB- neocortex , hippocampus and neostriatum -RRB- , but it was weaker and unevenly distributed in diencephalon .
7911744|The development of D2 autoreceptor-mediated modulation of K -LRB- + -RRB- - evoked dopamine release in the neostriatum .
7911744|A within-subject dose-response analysis was conducted by locally perfusing increasing concentrations -LRB- 0.1 , 1 , 10 and 100 microM -RRB- of the selective D2 agonist quinpirole via a microdialysis probe into the neostriatum of urethane-anesthetized rat pups 5 , 10-11 , 15-16 and 21-22 days of age and adult rats .
7911744|These results support and extend previous research that suggests that presynaptic D2 autoreceptors in the neostriatum are able to modulate K -LRB- + -RRB- - evoked dopamine release in vivo by postnatal day 5 in the rat .
7914025|In the second experiment , lesions of the neostriatum or hyperstriatum , analogous to the neocortex in mammals , did not produce a difference in weight gain compared to controls .
7914659|Our previous studies have shown several fold induction of neurotensin/neuromedin N -LRB- NT/N -RRB- primary transcripts and mature cytosolic mRNA in the dorsolateral region of the rat neostriatum -LRB- DLSt -RRB- following a single dose of the neuroleptic , haloperidol .
7915606|We here report that tyrosine hydroxylase immunocytochemistry demonstrates that these mutants have profound depletions in dopaminergic systems in the substantia nigra and corresponding areas of neostriatum .
7919172|The effect of kainic acid on the release of GABA in rat neostriatum and substantia nigra .
7919172|In order to test the hypotheses that stimulation of non-N-methyl-D-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- receptors in the neostriatum causes the release of gamma-aminobutyric acid -LRB- GABA -RRB- from nigrostriatal neurones , dual microdialysis was carried out in the neostriatum and substantia nigra of freely moving rats .
7919172|Application of kainic acid to the neostriatum caused a dose-dependent release of GABA both locally and , at the same time , from the ipsilateral substantia nigra .
7919172|It is concluded that excitatory amino acid receptor stimulation of the neostriatum releases GABA from striatonigral neurones and that stimulation of the substantia nigra causes the release from striatonigral terminals and/or the collaterals of nigrofugal neurones .
7922497|The cerebral cortex is the primary source of glutamatergic afferents to the neostriatum .
7922537|The highest densities were found in the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens , followed by the remainder of the neostriatum , cerebral cortex , and cerebellar cortex .
7922537|The presence of D3 receptors in non-limbic parts of the neostriatum and substantia nigra suggests that they also play a role in the dopaminergic control of motor processes .
7922557|GABA-LIR was found throughout the song system in neurons and neuropil of the robust nucleus of the archistriatum -LRB- RA -RRB- , the higher vocal center -LRB- HVC -RRB- , Area X , the magnocellular nucleus of the neostriatum -LRB- MAN -RRB- , and the dorsomedial portion of the nucleus intercollicularis -LRB- DM of ICo -RRB- .
7925801|Neuronal activity in rabbit neostriatum during classical eyelid conditioning .
7925801|Extracellular multiple - and single-unit recordings were made from the neostriatum of rabbits during classical eyelid conditioning .
7925801|These data are discussed in terms of a possible role for the neostriatum in eyelid conditioning .
7930403|The portrayal by Wilson , in 1925 , of the striatum as a simple homogeneous structure has been replaced by the recognition , based on staining characteristics , connectivity , and function , that the neostriatum is compartmentalized into striosomes , matrisomes , and matrix compartments .
7930403|Electrophysiologic studies have further shown the existence , in the neostriatum , of neuronal clusters that represent basic functional units much like the functional columns described much earlier for the cerebral cortex .
7930403|Whereas the neostriatum is considered the major receiving area of the basal ganglia , the globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars reticulata constitute the major output nuclei .
7930403|The previous concept of serial connectivity of the neostriatum -LRB- funnel concept -RRB- has been replaced by the concept of parallel connectivity .
7931303|In the neostriatum , amphetamine and other dopamine agonists elevate the extracellular level of ascorbate , which is known to modulate neostriatal function .
7931303|Although both D1 and D2 receptors have been linked to neostriatal ascorbate release , ample evidence suggests it is controlled by areas outside the neostriatum .
7931303|Thus , whereas unilateral electrolytic lesions of the substantia nigra pars reticulata completely abolished the ability of systemic amphetamine -LRB- 2.5 mg/kg -RRB- to increase extracellular ascorbate in ipsilateral neostriatum , intranigral infusions of this drug -LRB- 10 and 30 micrograms/microliters -RRB- elevated neostriatal ascorbate release .
7931303|These results , combined with previous evidence implicating cortical projections to neostriatum as the source of extracellular ascorbate , suggest that neostriatal ascorbate release is regulated , at least in part , by a nigro-thalamo-cortico-neostriatal pathway .
7932147|MPP + concentrations in the extracellular fluid of the neostriatum of the two species were similar after the administration of the same dose of MPTP -LRB- 40 mg/kg -RRB- .
7932148|In addition , by using the traditional postmortem examination , neostriatal dopamine was depleted markedly in mice -LRB- > or = 80 % -RRB- , but only depleted marginally in rats in which MPP + was infused into the neostriatum .
7936195|Synaptic potentiation and depression in slices of mediorostral neostriatum-hyperstriatum complex , an auditory imprinting-relevant area in chick forebrain .
7936195|We present here studies on long-term potentiation in slices of the chick forebrain area mediorostral neostriatum-hyperstriatum complex which receives thalamic afferents and is relevant for auditory filial imprinting .
7941722|On the basis of the data obtained we conclude that CRF-sensitive systems of the neostriatum participate in the mechanisms , underlying behavioural , vegetative and hormonal changes .

7953636|Administration of methamphetamine -LRB- MA -RRB- induces degeneration of dopaminergic nerve terminals and astrogliosis , such as hypertrophy and an increase in apparent number , in the neostriatum .
7953636|The results showed that MA-induced the typical depletion of dopaminergic terminals , reduction of dopamine content and astrogliosis in the neostriatum .
7953636|However , the reaction of astrocytes remained in the region where the most severe depletion of dopaminergic terminals was seen in MA treated animals -LRB- ventral-lateral portion of neostriatum -RRB- .
7953636|The results also indicate that blocking the dopamine transporter can not completely prevent the reaction of astrocytes in the neostriatum , which indicates that the astrocytic reaction can be induced by factors other than degeneration of dopaminergic terminals in this region .
7953659|Our previous results localizing cellular D2-like receptor expression patterns in this projection system of the rat neostriatum implies that all three of these dopamine receptor subtypes may be co-expressed in this efferent system .
7964683|Quantitative assessments of neuronal populations show neuronal loss , not only in various nuclei of the brainstem , diencephalon and cerebellum , but also in other areas , including the nucleus basalis of Meynert , substantia nigra and neostriatum .
7965067|These areas include subfields of field L -LRB- L1 and L3 -RRB- , the caudomedial neostriatum -LRB- NCM -RRB- , the caudomedial hyperstriatum ventrale -LRB- CMHV -RRB- anterior to field L , the caudal paleostriatum , and two field L targets , HVC shelf and RA cup .

7965086|Normal mice -LRB- + / + -RRB- and homozygous weaver mutant mice -LRB- wv/wv -RRB- at 1 year of age were used for three-dimensional computer-aided reconstructions of the nucleus accumbens -LRB- NA -RRB- and neostriatum -LRB- ST -RRB- and for quantitative estimations of the total number of medium-sized neurons in the NA and ST , and for the total number of tyrosine hydroxylase -LRB- TH -RRB- - containing neurons in the ventral tegmental area -LRB- VTA -RRB- and substantia nigra -LRB- SN -RRB- .
7965165|Radiolabeled ligands of monoamine transporters have already been used to visualize cerebral monoamine innervation by tissue autoradiography and by PET or SPECT in vivo.METHODS : A sampling technique was developed to allow for both the autoradiographic counting of serotonin -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- axonal varicosities , labeled by uptake and storage of -LSB- 3H -RSB- 5-HT , and the measurement of the binding of -LSB- 3H -RSB- cyanoimipramine -LRB- -LSB- 3H -RSB- CYI -RRB- , a specific 5-HT transporter ligand , in adjacent slices of adult rat neostriatum .
7965747|Previous studies have shown elevation of neurotensin neuromedin N -LRB- NT/N -RRB- and c-fos mRNA in the dorsolateral region of the rat neostriatum -LRB- DLSt -RRB- by acute administration of only typical antipsychotic drugs .
7965747|In contrast to the lateral neostriatum , NT/N mRNA expression in the nucleus accumbens-shell was elevated similarly by chronic treatment with haloperidol and clozapine to a level observed after acute haloperidol treatment .
7968362|In the adult brain , the distribution of aromatase mRNA was surprisingly widespread , and included the preoptic area , hypothalamus , hippocampus and neostriatum .
7969926|The functional roles played by metabotropic glutamate receptors in the neostriatum is just beginning to be examined .
7970180|The expression of five muscarinic receptor mRNAs -LRB- m1 , m2 , m3 , m4 , m5 -RRB- was examined in neostriatum , hippocampus and frontal cortex of 3 , 18 , and 33 month old rats .
7970180|A 6.0 kb transcript for the m5 muscarinic receptor was observed in hippocampus and neostriatum , but was not detected in frontal cortex .
7970180|Age-related changes in muscarinic receptor transcript expression were restricted to the neostriatum , where m3 and m4 mRNAs were decreased at both 18 and 33 months of age .
7971986|In situ hybridization with a 33P-labeled antisense AChE oligonucleotide provided evidence for high levels of AChE message in cells of the nucleus basalis , nucleus accumbens , neostriatum , substantia nigra , motor nucleus of the facial nerve , and spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve .
7971986|The relatively low number of these AChE-expressing cells probably explains the relative dearth of AChE mRNA-like material in the neostriatum .
7972076|No significant effects of training were found in the anterior hyperstriatum ventrale , lobus parolfactorius , neostriatum , medial hippocampal region , or ventrolateral hippocampal region , but counts in this last region were positively correlated with training approach .
7972118|During a search for abnormalities of catecholaminergic neurotransmission in patients with complex partial seizures of the mesial temporal lobe , we discovered an increase of the rate of metabolism of an exogenous dopa tracer -LRB- 6 - -LSB- 18F -RSB- fluoro-L-dopa -RRB- in the neostriatum of a subgroup of patients with a history of psychosis .
7972118|The finding is explained by the hypothesis that cortical insufficiency , a proposed pathogenetic mechanism of both disorders , causes an up-regulation of the enzymes responsible for dopa turnover in the neostriatum as well as the receptors mediating dopaminergic neurotransmission .
7972890|The acquisition of delayed matching-to-sample and the short-term retention of non-spatial visual information , using a small set of sample stimuli , were unaffected by aspiration lesions of the hippocampus or the neostriatum -LRB- Experiment 1 -RRB- .

7981873|Processing of nave rat brain at different ages for 5-HT immunocytochemistry showed that 5-HT axons were still clearly less numerous in the neostriatum at P21 than in adults , whereas in the substantia nigra the 5-HT innervation developed more rapidly and was comparable , at P21 , to that of adults .
7985492|The neostriatum and nucleus accumbens in parkinsonism-dementia complex of Guam : a pathological comparison with Alzheimer 's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy .
7985492|The neostriatum , nucleus accumbens and basal nucleus of Meynert -LRB- bnM -RRB- in the parkinsonism-dementia complex of Guam -LRB- Guam PDC -RRB- were examined immunohistologically , ultrastructurally , quantitatively and topographically , and the results were compared with those in Alzheimer 's disease -LRB- AD -RRB- and progressive supranuclear palsy -LRB- PSP -RRB- .
7985492|The decreased number of large neurons in the neostriatum was significantly correlated to that in the bnM .
7985492|The remaining large neurons and many of the medium-sized neurons in the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens were immunopositive for tau protein and contained varying amounts of 21 - to 25-nm-wide paired helical filaments -LRB- PHFs -RRB- admixed with straight tubules .
7985492|Collectively , these findings , which are similar in part to those of AD and differ from those of PSP , suggest that the large neurons in the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens in Guam PDC degenerate through PHF formation , and that extremely severe loss of large neurons in the nucleus accumbens may be linked to marked degeneration of the limbic and ventral tegmental areas and nucleus dorsal raphe .
7988642|Finally , there were no region-selective effects of 7-OH-DPAT on DOPA accumulation in the neostriatum .
7996441|In contrast , chronic treatment of mice with caffeine through their drinking water for 4 weeks , which increased the number of adenosine A1 receptors in the neostriatum and frontal cortex , followed by drug washout , prevented the neurochemical changes produced by the treatment of mice with METH treatment .

8001641|Three months after neonatal 6-hydroxydopamine lesion -LRB- 5-HT-hyperinnervated tissue -RRB- , inhibitory responses to all three agents were significantly increased and comparable results were obtained for 5-HT and DOI in the rostral versus caudal neostriatum .

8019671|Convergent synaptic input from the neostriatum and the subthalamus onto identified nigrothalamic neurons in the rat .
8019671|In order to better understand the role of these afferents in the flow of information through the basal ganglia and to better understand the ways in which they might interact , experiments have been performed to test the possibility that single-output neurons of the substantia nigra pars reticulata receive convergent synaptic input from the subthalamic nucleus and the neostriatum .
8019671|To address this , rats received iontophoretic deposits of the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin in the subthalamic nucleus , injections of the anterograde tracer biocytin in the neostriatum and injections of the retrograde tracer horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat-germ agglutinin in the ventral medial nucleus of the thalamus .
8019671|In areas of overlap between the two classes of terminals , identified nigrothalamic neurons and unlabelled nigral neurons were found to receive convergent synaptic input from the subthalamic nucleus and the neostriatum .
8021647|The size of neurons in the robust nucleus of the archistriatum -LRB- RA -RRB- and the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the neostriatum -LRB- lMAN -RRB- were inversely correlated with the distance of the EB pellet to HVC ; neurons in RA and lMAN were larger when the EB pellets were closer to HVC .
8027428|NMDAR1 subunits are expressed throughout the basal ganglia as well as in the rest of the brain ; however , the alternatively spliced amino-terminal region Insertion I is abundantly expressed only in the subthalamic nucleus and is not detectable in the neostriatum , globus pallidus , or substantia nigra pars compacta .
8027436|The principal aims in the present study were , therefore , to determine 1 -RRB- exactly how similar the vocal control system in budgerigars is to that in songbirds and 2 -RRB- whether the vocal control system in budgerigars receives auditory inputs from areas other than Field L. Biotinylated and fluorescently labeled dextrans were injected into five telencephalic nuclei of the vocal control system in budgerigars and into the physiologically identified auditory portions of the frontal neostriatum and nucleus basalis .
8027436|In songbirds , auditory information is conveyed to the vocal control system via Field L , whereas , in budgerigars , the auditory inputs to the vocal control system derive from nucleus basalis and the frontal neostriatum .
8032898|Moreover , it has not yet been clarified whether opioid receptor activation in neostriatum results in the modulation of calcium and/or potassium conductances .
8038933|It is hypothesised that the increases in rCBF in the orbitofrontal cortex , neostriatum , global pallidus and thalamus were related to urges to perform compulsive movements , while those in the hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex corresponded to the anxiety that accompanied them .

8055535|C-PON immunoreactive neurons in the neostriatum of the hedgehog -LRB- Erinaceus europaeus -RRB- : a correlated light - and electron-microscopic study .
8055535|The present study provides light - and electron-microscopic immunocytochemical data on the presence of neurons that are immunoreactive to the C-terminal flanking peptide of neuropeptide Y , C-PON , in the neostriatum of the hedgehog -LRB- Erinaceus europaeus -RRB- .
8055535|Immunostained fibers and puncta are also evenly distributed throughout the neostriatum .
8055535|Thus , a high degree of C-PON neuronal system phylogenetic conservation and function can be postulated for the neostriatum of mammals .
8058767|During associative learning , relative to the unpaired phase , blood flow was significantly increased in primary auditory and left posterior cingulate cortices and significantly decreased in areas of the right cerebellar , right prefrontal , right parietal , and insular cortices and right neostriatum .
8058767|The changes in areas such as the cerebellum , prefrontal cortex , and neostriatum provide support for their roles in associative learning as proposed by animal models .
8062103|We examined NMDA-sensitive -LSB- 3H -RSB- glutamate , -LSB- 3H -RSB- AMPA , -LSB- 3H -RSB- kainate and metabotropic-sensitive -LSB- 3H -RSB- glutamate binding sites in neostriatum and substantia nigra pars reticulata -LRB- SNr -RRB- in rats after unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the medial forebrain bundle .
8062103|One week after the lesion , NMDA , AMPA , kainate and metabotropic receptors were decreased in the ipsilateral neostriatum , whereas at three months NMDA receptors were increased while AMPA , kainate and metabotropic receptors were not changed .

8082036|A gonadal modulatory role was not always evident in all brain areas as revealed by long-day photic cycles producing diminished -LRB- p < 0.01 -RRB- binding levels in the anterior neostriatum and the nucleus rotundus of both castrated and gonadally intact animals , although elevated values were also found in the substantia grisea centralis -LRB- p < 0.05 -RRB- of the same animals .
8082698|Neuronal activity was recorded from the neostriatum of freely moving rats at least 1 week following either sham or bilateral ablations of frontal and somatosensory cortex .
809127|The latter facts suggest that the disturbances which subserve these two types of motor impairment , often concomitantly present in Parkinsonism , partially involve the impairment of different mechanisms although the loss of the DA fibers originating in the substantia nigra and ending in the neostriatum -LRB- Figure 1 -RRB- appears to represent a disturbance common to both types of disorders .
809127|At any rate the impairment of the brain DA mechanisms -LRB- and especially those of the neostriatum -RRB- seems to represent a major feature in the production of the Parkinsonian type of akinesia .
809127|Further work is needed to establish the relative importance of the loss of catecholaminergic mechanisms other than those of the neostriatum in the production of akinesia .
8093477|There was a sex difference in TH immunoreactivity within song-control nuclei : males had light to moderate staining in all three cortical nuclei examined , whereas females had little or no label in corresponding areas -LSB- lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- IMAN -RRB- , higher vocal center -LRB- HVC -RRB- , and robust nucleus of the archistriatum -LRB- RA -RRB- -RSB- .
8095172|The localization of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors to particular cell types in the neostriatum allows new insights to be made into the normal mode of action of dopamine to control motor function and how this is disturbed in disease stages e.g. Parkinson 's disease , Huntington 's disease .

8097237|N-methyl-D-aspartic acid differentially regulates extracellular dopamine , GABA , and glutamate levels in the dorsolateral neostriatum of the halothane-anesthetized rat : an in vivo microdialysis study .
8097237|These data support the view that NMDA receptor stimulation plays a role in the regulation of extracellular DA , GABA , and Glu levels in the dorso-lateral neostriatum and provide evidence for a differential effect of NMDA receptor stimulation on these three striatal neurotransmitter systems , possibly reflecting direct and indirect actions mediated via striatal NMDA receptors .
8097292|The effect of aminooxyacetic acid -LRB- AOAA -RRB- , an inhibitor of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes -LRB- including the aminotransferases -RRB- , on the K -LRB- + -RRB- - evoked release of amino acids was studied during microdialysis of neostriatum in anesthetized rats .
8098283|Changes in TH-immunoreactive nerve cell bodies and nerve terminals induced by the partial hemitransection were studied in the substantia nigra and neostriatum in combination with image analysis .
8098283|The substantia nigra and neostriatum were also subjected to biochemical analysis of DA , 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid levels .
8098283|A 2-week treatment with 100 mg/kg of modafinil also counteracted the hemitransection-induced depletion of DA stores in the neostriatum and the ventral midbrain .
8099796|Loss of dopaminergic innervation of the neostriatum is a prominent age-related change , which corresponds with the age-related loss of dopaminergic cell bodies from the substantia nigra .
8099796|This change is regionally specific , since dopaminergic innervation of the neocortex and the neostriatum are not affected .
8099796|There is also evidence for reduced serotonergic innervation of the neocortex and , less convincingly , the neostriatum .
8099796|Alzheimer 's disease is associated with more pronounced noradrenergic and serotonergic denervation but , unlike normal aging , dopaminergic innervation of neostriatum is intact ; although dopamine neurons are probably dysfunctional in this region .
8099798|In vivo regulation of extracellular dopamine in the neostriatum : influence of impulse activity and local excitatory amino acids .
8099798|Infusion of N-methyl-d-aspartate -LRB- NMDA -RRB- or kainate into the neostriatum increased extracellular dopamine , and this effect was blocked by co-infusion of 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate -LRB- APV -RRB- or 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2 ,3 - dione -LRB- CNQX -RRB- , respectively .
8099798|These and other findings reviewed in this report suggest to us that extracellular dopamine in the neostriatum is not stimulated locally by endogenous excitatory amino acids .
8102059|Neurochemical alterations but not nerve cell loss in aged rat neostriatum .
8102059|In the case of neuropeptide Y - and dopamine and adenosine 3 ' :5 ' - monophosphate-regulated phosphoprotein-immunoreactive neurons , the changes in the intensity of immunostaining were differentially compartmentalized within neostriatum , suggesting selective vulnerability of striatal subregions to ageing processes .
8102059|In conclusion , these data indicate that no significant age-related neuronal cell loss occurs in neostriatum .
8102059|On the other hand , a generalized decrease in the levels of peptide transmitters and molecules related to dopamine transmission is observed in aged rat neostriatum , possibly resulting in the known age-related deficits of neostriatally-controlled behaviours .
8102060|The results suggest that the formation of new synaptic connections in a pattern reminiscent of that seen in control neostriatum may be responsible , in part at least , for the behavioural recovery in motor skills seen in rats following intrastriatal striatal transplants .
8104322|Platelet-activating factor inhibits excitatory transmission in rat neostriatum .
8104322|It is concluded that PAF acts presynaptically to inhibit the release of glutamate at excitatory synapses in the neostriatum .
8104676|It is suggested that dopamine , released by amphetamine , induces the release of amino acid neurotransmitters in the neostriatum .
8104820|Fetal neostriatal tissue was transplanted into either the neostriatum or substantia nigra of adult rats .
8105039|In order to assess glutamate-ascorbate interactions and their influence on the behavioral output of the basal ganglia , glutamate and homocysteic acid -LRB- a glutamate reuptake blocker -RRB- as well as NMDA antagonists were infused into the neostriatum of freely moving rats while extracellular neostriatal ascorbate was monitored via electrochemically modified carbon-fiber electrodes .

8123190|In the neostriatum -LRB- caudate nucleus -RRB- , loss of dopamine and increased HVA : dopamine ratio correlated with the reduction in substantia nigra neurons in LBD but not PD , despite the greater loss of neurones and dopamine and the higher dopamine turnover ratio in PD .
8130731|After sacrifice by decapitation , their brains were removed and the neostriatum dissected out to assay DA receptors and adenylyl cyclase activity .
8135128|In the present work we have studied the postnatal development of functional dopamine , opioid and tachykinin receptors , which regulate cholinergic activity in the neostriatum .
8135128|In order to examine the influence of dopamine in the development of tachykinin and opioid systems in the neostriatum , we induced dopamine deficiency by intraventricular injection of 6-hydroxydopamine at postnatal day 3 .
8157122|With regard to two aspartic proteinases , cathepsin E was barely detectable in all the brain tissues of young adult rats , including the cerebral cortex , the hippocampus , the neostriatum , and the cerebellum , whereas cathepsin D was ubiquitously found in these tissues .
8157122|Cathepsin E was markedly increased in the cerebral cortex and neostriatum of aged rats , but not in the other tissues .
8157122|The levels of cathepsin B were also increased significantly in the neostriatum of aged rats , but not significantly in the other tissues .
8157122|The increased immunoreactivity of cathepsin B in the neostriatum of aged rats was also found in both the neurons and the glial cells .
8158124|The calcium dependency and tetrodotoxin sensitivity of extracellular dopamine levels were assessed by microdialysis in the neostriatum of 5-day-old rat pups and were compared with those obtained in adult rats .
8158139|The stereotaxic administration of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion -LRB- MPP + -RRB- into the neostriatum of male rats caused a lesion that resulted in a large dose-dependent loss of striatal fructose 2,6-bisphosphate ; initial values were restored 5 days after the treatment .
8158226|Spontaneous fluctuations of membrane potential , patterns of spontaneous firing , dendritic branching patterns , and intracortical and striatal axonal arborizations were compared for two types of corticostriatal neurons in the medial agranular cortex of urethan-anesthetized rats : 1 -RRB- pyramidal tract -LRB- PT -RRB- cells identified by antidromic activation from the medullary pyramid and 2 -RRB- crossed corticostriatal -LRB- CST -RRB- neurons identified by antidromic activation from the contralateral neostriatum .
8158226|The more common type -LRB- 6 of 8 -RRB- was a large , deep layer V neuron that had an extensive intracortical axon arborization but a limited axon arborization in the neostriatum .
8158226|Their axons gave rise to an extensive arbor of local axon collaterals that distributed in the region of the parent neuron , frequently extending throughout the more superficial layers , including layer I. Axon collaterals were also traced to the corpus callosum , as expected from their contralateral projections , and they contributed axon collaterals to the ipsilateral neostriatum .
8158226|In the neostriatum , these axons formed extended arborizations sparsely occupying a large volume of striatal tissue .
8159292|Islands and striosomes in the neostriatum of the rhesus monkey : non-equivalent compartments .
8159292|Cytoarchitectonically defined cell-dense islands and regions of low acetylcholinesterase reactivity referred to as striosomes have been regarded as equivalent markers of the non-matrix compartment in the neostriatum .
8159292|However , due to the fact that striosomes are more numerous and more widely distributed throughout the neostriatum , less than a third of all striosomes are coincident with islands in adjacent sections .
8159292|These results indicate that islands and striosomes are not entirely equivalent compartmental markers and further suggest that contemporary , two-compartment models may not adequately represent the heterogeneity of the neostriatum .
8164511|Cerebral hemidecortication alters expression of transforming growth factor alpha mRNA in the neostriatum of developing rats .
8164511|In order to test whether TGF alpha may be involved in the functional recovery of the neostriatum following cerebral hemidecortication , we performed in situ hybridization for TGF alpha mRNA on brains of rats which underwent hemispherectomy at postnatal day -LRB- P -RRB- 6 or P12 or in adulthood , and sacrificed one , 7 , or 30 days following surgery .
8164511|In animals undergoing lesion at earlier ages -LRB- P6 and P12 -RRB- , TGF alpha mRNA expression was first depressed in the ipsilateral neostriatum one day after surgery and then elevated to supranormal levels 7 and 30 days after surgery .
8164511|Maximal decreases -LRB- 40 % below contralateral neostriatum -RRB- were seen in animals lesioned at P12 and sacrificed the next day .
8164511|Maximal elevations -LRB- 60 % greater than opposite neostriatum -RRB- were seen in animals operated on at P6 and sacrificed 30 days post surgery .
8167440|This paper examines the influence of aluminum chloride at different concentrations on the activity of ChAT in homogenates from basal forebrain and neostriatum of rats during postnatal growth .
8170539|5-hydroxydopamine-labeled dopaminergic axons : three-dimensional reconstructions of axons , synapses and postsynaptic targets in rat neostriatum .
8170539|We re-examined 5-hydroxydopamine-labeled material from the rat neostriatum using serial three-dimensional reconstruction techniques to characterize the morphology of labeled axons , synapses and postsynaptic targets .
8170539|The sites of these synapses along the axon appeared unrelated to the locations of axonal enlargements , suggesting that counting varicosities may not be an accurate indication of the extent of dopaminergic innervation in the neostriatum .
8170539|Synapses of various morphologies with a distinctly different , lighter form of labeling were much rarer , and may represent other aminergic afferents to the neostriatum .
8177374|The effects of apomorphine -LRB- 0.05 , 0.1 , and 1.0 mg/kg , s.c. -RRB- on K -LRB- + -RRB- - evoked dopamine release were studied through the use of in vivo microdialysis in the neostriatum of developing and adult rats .
8177374|Apomorphine attenuated K -LRB- + -RRB- - evoked dopamine release in all age groups , suggesting that the dopamine autoreceptor modulating release in the neostriatum is functional by 5 days of age .
8180796|Computer-assisted image analysis was performed on sections through the medial septum , the diagonal band of Broca , the basal nucleus of Meynert and the neostriatum .
8181667|Intracerebral transplantation : basic and clinical applications to the neostriatum .
8181667|Many studies have used the intracerebral transplantation technique to study the neostriatum .
8181667|In animals with striatal damage , fetal striatal tissue implanted into the neostriatum -LRB- homotypic transplants -RRB- displays a remarkable anatomical and functional incorporation into the host brain .
8181667|In contrast , fetal substantia nigra neurons implanted into the dopamine-depleted neostriatum -LRB- heterotypic transplants -RRB- generally show a more restricted integration into the host brain and elicit fewer behavioral improvements .
8182478|To better understand the roles of the different muscarinic receptor subtypes -LRB- m1-m4 -RRB- , we have determined the cellular and subcellular distribution of the m1-m4 receptor proteins in the rat neostriatum using subtype-specific antibodies and avidin-biotin-peroxidase immunocytochemistry for light and electron microscopy .
8182478|m4 receptor protein was heterogeneously distributed in the neostriatum and localized to 44 % of striatal cells .
8182549|Induction of neurotensin and c-fos mRNA in distinct subregions of rat neostriatum after acute methamphetamine : comparison with acute haloperidol effects .
8182549|Large increases of neurotensin -LRB- NT -RRB- - like immunoreactivity in the rat neostriatum have been reported previously after treatment with either dopamine D2 receptor antagonists -LRB- e.g. , haloperidol -RRB- or potent indirect dopamine agonists -LRB- e.g. , methamphetamine -RRB- .
8182549|Unlike haloperidol , methamphetamine increased NT/N mRNA expression in the periventricular dorsomedial quadrant of the striatum and induced c-fos mRNA primarily in the medial aspects of the central core of the neostriatum .
819102|Preterminal and terminal fiber degeneration were notably sparse in most of the neostriatum , except the dorsolateral region of the caudate nucleus .
8212883|-LSB- The cholinoreactive system of the neostriatum and the active avoidance behavior of rats in a T maze -RSB- .
8212883|In experiments with 57 Sprague-Dawley male rats was studied the influence of single right - and left-side injections of different doses of choline agonist carbachol and choline blocker scopolamine into the dorsal part of the neostriatum -LRB- the head of the caudate nucleus -RRB- on active avoidance conditioning in a T-maze and on the locomotor activity .
8214632|The neostriatum showed a rather complex pattern of staining with unstained areas , such as the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum , and other parts intensely stained , especially in its caudal region .
8219007|DADTI labelling clearly demonstrated selective and high affinity binding sites of delta-opioid type in several brain regions , including olfactory system , neostriatum , nucleus accumbens , and cortical layers I-II and V-VI .
822916|A Golgi study of neuronal types in the neostriatum of monkeys .
822916|Findings indicate that the neostriatum has 2 distinct types of spiny neurons with long axons -LRB- spiny I and II -RRB- , some of which may contribute to the efferent system .
822916|A realistic interpretation of neurophysiologic data on the neostriatum must take into account all cell types instead of the current view of considering it as a pool of interneurons with few output cells .
8229199|Type IV status was characterized by generalized clonus , unremitting ictal EEG discharges , and the additional activation of most of the dorsolateral neocortex , neostriatum , and thalamus .
8231021|We compared their relative abundance in the renal cortex , renal medulla and neostriatum from the brain , where DARPP-32 is greatly enriched .
8231021|DARPP-32 levels in the adult rat were fourfold higher in the neostriatum than in the renal medulla and 13-fold higher than in the renal cortex .
8231021|I-1 levels were approximately the same in the neostriatum and in the renal medulla and 2.5-fold higher in neostriatum than in the renal cortex .
8231021|Between postnatal day 10 -LRB- PN10 -RRB- and 40 -LRB- PN40 -RRB- DARPP-32 abundance increased 1.3-fold in the neostriatum , 1.4-fold in the renal cortex and sixfold in the medulla .
8241455|An antioestrogen induced inhibition of myelination could be detected in the song motor centre robust nucleus of the archistriatum -LRB- RA -RRB- and in the cerebellum , whereas the region magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- MAN -RRB- showed no difference between treated birds and controls .
8242399|Semiquantitative data concerning bFGF mRNA expression were obtained by use of computer-assisted microdensitometry and revealed substantial increases in bFGF mRNA expression in the cingulate cortex , the neostriatum , a 1 mm marginal zone close to the external capsule and the olfactory tubercle at bregma levels 1 to 2 mm rostral to the lesion .
8243588|We have studied the ability of the vigilance-promoting drug modafinil to counteract the ischemic lesion produced by a unilateral microinjection of endothelin-1 -LRB- ET-1 -RRB- in the neostriatum of the rat using a combined morphometrical , biochemical , cardiovascular and behavioral analysis .
8243588|ET-1 was injected unilaterally into the neostriatum .
8243588|Thus , morphological , neurochemical , and behavioral evidence that the putative ischemic striatal injury induced by microinjection of ET-1 in the rat neostriatum is counteracted in a dose-dependent way by modafinil treatment has been obtained .
8245975|The effects of apomorphine -LRB- 0.05 , 0.1 , and 1.0 mg/kg , s.c. -RRB- on the extracellular levels of dopamine and the dopamine metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid were studied through the use of in vivo microdialysis in the neostriatum of developing and adult rats .
8245975|Apomorphine attenuated extracellular levels of dopamine in all age groups , suggesting that the dopamine autoreceptor modulating release in the neostriatum is functional by 5 days of age .
8245975|Extracellular levels of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid were also significantly decreased in all age groups , consistent with the hypothesis that synthesis-modulating dopamine autoreceptors in the neostriatum are functional by 5 days of age .
8246509|The qualitative dynamical behaviour of a neural model based on the mammalian neostriatum was analyzed .
8246509|The neostriatum was modelled as a mutually inhibitory network of physiological neurones , which was driven by excitatory afferents from the cerebral cortex .
8246509|We have previously argued that the mode of co-activation in the neostriatum may correspond to the state of muscular rigidity which occurs as a symptom of Parkinson 's disease .
8248241|Regulation by the neuropeptide cholecystokinin -LRB- CCK-8S -RRB- of protein phosphorylation in the neostriatum .
8253123|The binding kinetics and pharmacological selectivity of the photoaffinity delta-opioid ligand -LSB- 125I -RSB- azido-DTLET -LRB- Tyr-D-Thr-Gly-Phe -LRB- pN3 -RRB- - Leu-Thr -RRB- were investigated in serial frozen sections from rat neostriatum prior to ultraviolet irradiation -LRB- i.e. , in conditions of reversibility -RRB- .
8257395|Findings at necropsy and upon microscopic examination were bilaterally symmetrical areas of necrosis of the cerebral hemispheres in the area of the neostriatum that were well demarcated from the surrounding normal neuropil .
827|Dopamine-containing neurons of the substantia nigra and their terminals in the neostriatum .
827|Tennyson VM , Mytilineou C , Heikkila R , Barrett RE , Cohen G , Ct L , Duffy PE , Marco L. Tne ultrastructural and fluorescence histochemical characteristics of the mature rabbit substantia nigra and neostriatum have been reviewed as a frame of reference for the developmental study .
827|The development of the neurons of the substantia nigra and their axons which project to the neostriatum has been presented from their appearance at day 14 of gestation to their maturation in early postnatal life .
827|The fluorescent axons of the substantia nigra grow into the putamen and caudate nucleus in a nonuniform manner forming fluorescent islands throughout the neostriatum in late fetal life .
827|In an attempt to identify further the dopamine-containing axon , the ultratructure of adult neostriatum incubated in 5-hydroxydopamine was reported .
827000|Quantitative aspects of neuronal organization in the neostriatum of the macaque monkey .
8276991|L1 and L3 project predominantly to the dorsal neostriatum -LRB- Nd -RRB- caudolateral to Field L , and have fewer projections to the caudomedial paleostriatum and anterior hyperstriatum accessorium .
8277000|In the present study , the compartmental organization of the nucleus accumbens was investigated by comparing the pattern of leu-enkephalin immunoreactivity with that of the opioid receptor ligand , naloxone , an established marker for the compartmental organization of the neostriatum .
8290027|The influence of chronic activation and blockade of the dopamine - and enkephalinergic systems of the neostriatum on conditioned reflex behavior and dopamine metabolism in the rat nigrostriatal system .
8290027|The effects of daily injections , over the course of 14 days , of 45 micrograms of phenamine , 5 micrograms of haloperidol and naloxone , 15 micrograms of leu-enkephalin and its analog , a tetrapeptide , into the rostral neostriatum have been studied .
8290027|The possible causes of the noncorrespondence of the behavioral and neurochemical shifts in the presence of a direct chronic pharmacological action on the mediator of the neostriatum .
8298090|Here we can report that direct unilateral infusion into the rat neostriatum of an antisense phosphothioate oligodeoxynucleotide to c-fos mRNA leads to the rapid induction of ipsilateral rotational behaviour after d-amphetamine administration .
8298090|This is associated with an elimination of the in vivo expression of Fos-like immunoreactivity within the infused region of neostriatum .
8309531|The projections from the neostriatum and the paleostriatum to the cerebral cortex in the cat were examined by means of retrogradely transported fluorescent tracers primuline , Fast Blue , Nuclear Yellow and Evans Blue injected into different neocortical fields .
8313150|In the second experiment , the neurotoxic agent 6-hydroxydopamine was injected directly into the nucleus accumbens , medial neostriatum or ventrolateral neostriatum in order to determine the effects of DA depletion on lever pressing performance .
832165|The topographical distribution of serotoninergic terminals in the neostriatum of the rat and the caudate nucleus of the cat .
832165|The topographical distribution of serotoninergic terminals in the neostriatum of the rat and the caudate nucleus of the cat was established owing to the combined use of microdissection techniques and biochemical microassays .
832165|However , in the rat neostriatum , but not in the cat caudate nucleus , -LSB- 3H -RSB- 5-HT even at a very low extracellular concentration -LRB- 4.4 - x 10 -LRB- -8 -RRB- M -RRB- was taken up not only by serotoninergic terminals but also to a significant extent by dopaminergic terminals .
832165|In presence of benztropine , this second component was suppressed and -LSB- 3H -RSB- 5-HT uptake activity could then be considered as a specific marker of serotoninergic terminals also in the neostriatum of the rat .
832165|The density of 5-HT terminals decreased progressively from the acudal to the rostral planes of the neostriatum in rats or the caudate nucleus in cats .
832165|Electrolytic lesion of the dorsalis -LRB- B7 -RRB- and centralis superior -LRB- B8 -RRB- raphe nuclei during early life resulted in a large decrease of 5-HT levels -LRB- -- 90 % -RRB- in various parts of the neostriatum of adult rats .
832299|Neuronal arrangement in the auditory field L of the neostriatum of the starling .
832299|Light microscopic investigations show that nerve cells of the field L in the starling neostriatum are dispersed into small groups forming unit-like clusters .
8328648|Cranial computed tomography -LRB- CT -RRB- revealed a low density area bilaterally at the neostriatum .
8329122|Three of them underwent ablation of the posterodorsolateral neostriatum -LRB- PDLNS -RRB- which is believed to correspond to the mammalian prefrontal cortex .
8332254|A dopamine-rich neuronal cell suspension obtained from embryonic day 14 mesencephali was injected unilaterally into the neostriatum of otherwise intact neonatal or adult rats at one day or two months of age , respectively .
8332254|In rats receiving transplants as adults , grafts were compact and located in the neostriatum .
8332254|In contrast , in rats receiving transplants neonatally , fewer dopaminergic neurons survived and they were dispersed over a large area of the host neostriatum and nucleus accumbens .
8332254|This prolonged period for the development of recovery contrasts markedly with the rapid recovery obtained when similar grafts are implanted into the denervated neostriatum of adult rats that had received a prior 6-hydroxydopamine lesion .
8332254|Thus , whereas the age of the host at the time of implantation can markedly influence the gross morphological organization of dopaminergic grafts implanted into the neostriatum , the functional effects were similar , whether the grafts were implanted into neonatal or adult hosts .
8332257|A moderate number of medium bipolar and multipolar cells were scattered throughout the neostriatum , and a moderate number of pyramidal and pyramidal-like cells were seen in the CA fields of the hippocampus .
8339772|Transient forebrain ischemia induces increased expression and specific localization of cathepsins E and D in rat hippocampus and neostriatum .
8339772|The accumulation and localization of cathepsins E and D in the rat hippocampus and neostriatum during the neurodegenerating process induced by transient forebrain ischemia were investigated by immunoprecipitation and by immunohistochemistry using discriminative antibodies specific for each enzyme .
8339772|While significant amounts of cathepsin D were found in both the hippocampus and the neostriatum of normal rats , cathepsin E was barely detectable in these tissues .
8347803|We have studied by in situ hybridization histochemistry the mRNA expression of preprocholecystokinin -LRB- CCK -RRB- in grafts of foetal striatal tissue neurones implanted into the ibotenic acid lesioned adult rat neostriatum .
8347803|Using a 35S-labelled ` antisense ' oligonucleotide -LRB- 45-mer -RRB- probe complementary to the rat CCK cDNA we observed a dense hybridization signal for CCK mRNA in the striatal eminence in developing embryos and in all the striatal grafts examined ; no CCK mRNA expressing cells were found in the normal neonatal or adult rat neostriatum .
8347803|The germinal cell layer of the striatal eminence is the source of origin for these non-striatal cell groups as well as for cells destined to form the neostriatum .
8349845|Spatial distributions of chemically identified intrinsic neurons in relation to patch and matrix compartments of rat neostriatum .
8349845|The spatial distributions and dendritic branching patterns of chemically identified subpopulations of striatal intrinsic neurons , defined by immunoreactivity for choline acetyltransferase -LRB- ChAT -RRB- , neuropeptide Y or parvalbumin , were studied in relation to patch and matrix compartments of rat neostriatum .
8349845|Neuropeptide Y immunoreactivity was uniform in the neostriatum .
8350129|Nociceptive responses in the neostriatum and globus pallidus of the anesthetized rat .
8350129|Extracellular recordings were made from neurons in the neostriatum -LRB- caudate nucleus-putamen , CPu -RRB- and globus pallidus -LRB- GP -RRB- of anesthetized rats .
8350129|The results demonstrate that a large proportion of somatosensory neurons within the neostriatum and globus pallidus -LRB- especially along the CPu-GP border -RRB- receive nociceptive information .
8360949|Their brains were dissected to obtain samples of neostriatum , Globus pallidus , Substantia nigra , and Raphe nuclei , which were then analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography , coupled either to electrochemical detection for aromatic monoamines , or to post-column ninhydrin derivatization with spectrophotometry for amino acids .
8360949|The neonatal 6-OHDA treatment depleted dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- levels in neostriatum , Globus pallidus , and Substantia nigra , but in Raphe nuclei DA was increased .
8360949|The main metabolites of DA were also decreased in neostriatum , Globus pallidus , and Substantia nigra but remained unchanged in Raphe nuclei .
8360949|Serotonin -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- and its metabolite 5-hydroxy-indole-3-acetic acid increased in neostriatum and Raphe nuclei ; in Substantia nigra there was a slight increase in 5-HT only .
8360949|In the neostriatum there were increases of gamma-aminobutyric acid -LRB- GABA -RRB- , aspartic acid , and glycine .
8361633|Lateral quadrants of the neostriatum in old rats appeared to show declines in primarily the long transcripts .
8361951|This difference in behavioural profile between buspirone and the other two compounds is probably explained by its DA receptor blocking properties , as indicated by an increased DOPA accumulation in the neostriatum .
8364733|Neurochemical evidence of functional A10 dopamine terminals innervating the ventromedial axis of the neostriatum : in vitro voltammetric data in rat brain slices .
8364733|The neostriatum -LRB- CPu -RRB- and nucleus accumbens -LRB- NAc -RRB- receive their primary dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- afferents from the A9 and A10 cell groups , respectively .
8367598|Since similar findings have been observed in aging , the results are discussed in terms of the parallels between aging and radiation effects in signal transduction that might exist in the neostriatum .
8376984|Using a sensitive RNase protective assay , preliminary studies demonstrated the predicted regional distribution for the 5-HT2 receptor mRNA : levels of 5-HT2 mRNA were highest in frontal cortex -LRB- 2.58 amol/micrograms of total RNA -RRB- , intermediate in neostriatum , thalamus , and midbrain , and lowest in hippocampus , cerebellum , and choroid plexus .
8381906|While 5-HT transporter mRNA is abundantly expressed in the midbrain raphe complex , lower concentrations were also found in frontal cortex , hippocampus , and neostriatum using a combination of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction -LRB- RT-PCR -RRB- , Southern hybridization , and sequence analysis .
8382266|Amino acid levels and gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptors in rat neostriatum , cortex , and thalamus after neonatal 6-hydroxydopamine lesion .
8382266|In the neostriatum -LRB- caudate putamen -RRB- , medium-sized aspiny interneurons , as well as neostriatal output neurons that project to several brain regions , use GABA as their neurotransmitter .
8382266|Dopamine fibers arising from the substantia nigra represent a major input to the neostriatum where , besides their classic neurotransmitter role , they are seemingly involved in the regulation of amino acid neurotransmitter release .
8382266|After a 3-month survival , levels of catecholamines , indoleamines , and amino acids were determined in cingulate cortex , thalamus , and neostriatum .
8382266|In the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats , levels of dopamine and its metabolites homovanillic acid , 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid , and 3-methoxytyramine were decreased , as expected , in cortex and neostriatum , but remained unmodified in thalamus .
8382266|In all three regions , serotonin content was increased ; its metabolite , 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid , was also elevated , but only in cortex and neostriatum .
8382266|The levels of GABA were increased in neostriatum and thalamus , but remained unmodified in cortex .
8382266|There were also increases of phosphatidylethanolamine and serine in thalamus , and of aspartic acid and alanine in neostriatum .
8382266|The density of GABAA binding sites was increased in neostriatum , but remained unchanged in cortex and thalamus .
8382736|Voltage-activated high - and low-threshold Ca2 + currents were studied using whole-cell voltage-clamp techniques and fura-2 fluorescence measurements of intracellular Ca2 + in neurons acutely isolated from rat neostriatum .
8384247|Studies to verify the specificity of the RNase protection assay revealed that the distribution of beta 1AR mRNA was in agreement with the reported distribution of beta 1AR ligand binding : Levels of beta 1AR mRNA were highest in cerebral cortex or frontal cortex , intermediate in neostriatum , hippocampus , lung , and heart , and lowest in cerebellum , kidney , and liver .
8385206|Over the same time interval , no loss was observed for neurons projecting from the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum to RA .
8388042|The effect of the metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist trans-1-aminocyclopentane-1 ,3 - dicarboxylic acid -LRB- t-ACPD -RRB- on glutamatergic transmission at corticostriate synapses was examined using slices of neostriatum .
8394711|Effects of gabapentin on release of gamma-aminobutyric acid from slices of rat neostriatum .
8395955|The binding sites for -LSB- 3H -RSB- cAMP were discretely localized , and were in the order of : cerebral cortex = hypothalamus = amygdala > hippocampus = neostriatum = thalamus = nucleus accumbens > globus pallidus = cerebellum .
8413844|Cocaine and dopaminergic actions in rat neostriatum .
8415621|In the rat neostriatum , the majority of D1 and D2 immunoreactivity was localized in postsynaptic sites in subsets of spiny dendrites and spine heads in rat neostriatum .
8415753|Dense positive terminals were seen in the neostriatum , nucleus accumbens shell , olfactory tubercle , septal areas , cingulate , and medial prefrontal cortex .
8420619|The immunohistochemical dopamine levels in the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens in SHR were lower than those in WKY .
8422898|Neurotensin and cholecystokinin octapeptide control synergistically dopamine release and dopamine D2 receptor affinity in rat neostriatum .
8422898|Combined perfusion of the neostriatum with 1 nM of cholecystokinin octapeptide -LRB- CCK-8 -RRB- and 0.01 , 0.1 or 1 nM of neurotensin was done in the halothane-anesthetized rat after systemic apomorphine treatment -LRB- 0.05 mg/kg , s.c. -RRB- .
8422898|Thus , neurotensin and CCK receptors may regulate synergistically , via intramembrane interactions with the D2 receptors , the binding characteristics and the signal transduction of D2 autoreceptors in the neostriatum .
8426234|Moderate densities were found in neocortical layers 4-6 , the neostriatum , amygdala , the dorsal root ganglia , and the central gray of spinal cord .
8432903|Brains of oscine songbirds of both sexes , unlike brains of nonsongbirds , had ER-IRC in three specific structures of the nonlimbic forebrain : in the area surrounding the nucleus robustus archistriatalis ; in the rostral forebrain ; and , for all individuals , in the caudale neostriatum , including the nucleus hyperstriatalis ventrale , pars caudale -LRB- HVc -RRB- .

8439806|The connections of a higher order auditory area in the neostriatum intermedium pars ventrolateralis -LRB- NIVL -RRB- were mapped with pathway tracing techniques in order to elucidate possible pathways by which auditory feedback may influence vocal learning in the budgerigar -LRB- Melopsittacus undulatus -RRB- .
8439806|Previous research has shown that NIVL receives projections from Field ` L' as well as adjacent portions of the dorsolateral neostriatum intermedium -LRB- NIDL -RRB- and hyperstriatum ventrale -LRB- HV -RRB- and , therefore , may be homologous to previously described auditory centers in the dorsal and lateral portions of the auditory neostriatum of songbirds .
8439806|The efferent connections of NIVL terminate within a small portion of the rostromedial archistriatum as well as a more rostrally situated area within the medial neostriatum intermedium -LRB- NI -RRB- and HV .
8439806|The DMP projection field corresponds to that previously described as the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum ; this nucleus is known to project to the higher vocal center in the budgerigar .

8451265|The present study was conducted to characterize the changes in feeding behavior produced by localized depletion of dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- in the nucleus accumbens and subregions of the neostriatum in the rat .
8453482|Using relatively straightforward software and hardware modifications of a widely used clinical MRI unit , we were able to image numerous structures within the living rat brain including the neostriatum , hippocampus , periaqueductal gray , and the ventricular system .
8464535|The cellular localization of the tyrosine-specific protein kinase p62c-yes , the product of the proto-oncogene c-yes , has been examined in the striatonigral neurons which interconnect the rat neostriatum and substantia nigra .
8464535|Although p62c-yes was more enriched in the neostriatum than in the substantia nigra , excitotoxin-induced necrosis of nerve cells in the neostriatum led to 50-60 % decreases of p62c-yes both in the lesioned neostriatum and in the ipsilateral substantia nigra .

8469306|This study compares the behavioural efficiency of dopaminergic mesencephalic neurons implanted into the rat neostriatum and/or the nucleus accumbens .
8469306|Three weeks later , embryonic dopaminergic mesencephalic neurons were implanted into the denervated neostriatum , or the nucleus accumbens or into both locations -LRB- double grafts -RRB- .
8469306|These findings suggest that the simultaneous reinnervation of the neostriatum and the nucleus accumbens by dopaminergic transplants is not sufficient to re-establish normal function in more complex behavioural tasks .
8469378|In order to examine the relationship between the action of opioid neurotransmitters and growth factors in the regulation of brain development , we have studied the long-term effect of the opiate antagonist naltrexone -LRB- NTX -RRB- on the content of nerve growth factor -LRB- NGF -RRB- in cortex , hippocampus , septum and neostriatum , and on NGF receptor -LRB- NGFRs -RRB- levels in cortical membranes .
8469378|However , low doses of NTX -LRB- 1 mg/kg -RRB- produced no differences in 125I-NGF binding sites , but induced a decrease in NGF levels in hippocampus , septum and neostriatum .

8487948|This effect is abolished by excitotoxic lesions of the neostriatum , which , along with behavioural , electrophysiological and receptor binding studies , suggests that cholecystokinin exerts its action indirectly on dopamine release via receptors located on intrinsic striatal neurons .
8490720|Neonatal destruction of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons by cerebroventricular injection of 6-hydroxydopamine -LRB- 6-OHDA -RRB- results in a serotonin -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- hyperinnervation of the rostral neostriatum in adult rat .
8490720|5-HT1A , 5-HT1B , 5HT1nonAB and 5-HT2 sites were labeled with -LSB- 3H -RSB- 8-OH-DPAT , -LSB- 125I -RSB- cyanopindolol , -LSB- 3H -RSB- 5-HT and -LSB- 125I -RSB- DOI , respectively , and measured in the rostral and caudal halves of neostriatum and selected forebrain or midbrain regions .
8490720|Three months after the lesion , 5-HT1B binding was increased throughout the neostriatum -LRB- 30 % -RRB- , but also in the substantia nigra -LRB- 50 % -RRB- and globus pallidus -LRB- 30 % -RRB- , suggesting an up-regulation and an increased axonal transport of these receptors in neostriatal projection neurons .
8490720|5-HT1nonAB binding was also increased throughout the neostriatum -LRB- 40 % -RRB- and in the substantia nigra -LRB- 50 % -RRB- , but unchanged in the globus pallidus , as if this up-regulation preferentially involved striatonigral as opposed to striatopallidal neurons .
8490720|5-HT2 binding showed an even greater increase -LRB- 60 % -RRB- , which was restricted to the rostral half of neostriatum and also seemed imputable to an up-regulation as heteroreceptors .
8490730|The effects of systemic injections of amphetamine sulfate on the extracellular levels of glycine , GABA , and taurine in the neostriatum of awake rats were studied using a push-pull perfusion system .
8490730|It is suggested that dopamine , released by amphetamine , induces the release of inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters in the neostriatum .
8491869|In the telencephalon , the nuclei basalis , accumbens , ectostriatum , paleostriatum primitivum , and the ventral paleostriatum are particularly rich in GFAP-positive cells , whereas the neostriatum , hyperstriatum , and paleostriatum augmentatum are almost devoid of GFAP labelling .
8501517|Three nuclei within this network form a neural pathway that is particularly important for vocal learning in juveniles : area X of the avian striatum projects to the medial dorsolateral nucleus of the anterior thalamus -LRB- DLM -RRB- , which in turn projects to the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- IMAN -RRB- .

8508302|Responses of the subthalamic nucleus -LRB- STH -RRB- neurons to the stimulation of the sensorimotor cortex -LRB- Cx -RRB- were recorded in intact rats and in those which received lesions in the pallidum , the neostriatum , the brainstem , or the corpus callosum .
8508302|A quinolinic acid lesion of the neostriatum and a knife cut of the brainstem failed to alter these responses , while an ibotenic acid lesion of the globus pallidus abolished the short inhibition seen in the midst on the excitation .
8508323|The reactive cells and their processes could be distinguished using experimental incubations from 1:8,000 -LRB- in immunofluorescence processing -RRB- to 1:80,000 -LRB- in immunoperoxidase processing -RRB- in the most reactive nervous system region , the neostriatum .
8509503|The mammalian neostriatum is divisible into neurochemically and cytoarchitectonically distinct striosome and matrix compartments .
8509503|Sections containing retrogradely labeled neurons in the neostriatum were simultaneously immunolabeled for calbindin-D28kDa , a calcium-binding protein found exclusively in the projection neurons of the matrix .
8515252|The auditory responses in one such nucleus , robustus archistriatalis -LRB- RA -RRB- , were characterized by making multi-unit recordings in awake and anesthetized adult male zebra finches and in birds that had received lesions of the input to RA from the lateral part of the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- LMAN -RRB- or the Higher Vocal Center -LRB- HVC -RRB- .
8519275|Tissue concentrations of serotonin and of its metabolite 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid were also determined by high-performance liquid chromatography in cingulate cerebral cortex , rostral neostriatum , hippocampus and midbrain raphe nucleus region .
8553910|Projections from the visual areas to the neostriatum in rats .

8616583|Disruption of synaptic activity of a number of cerebral structures -LRB- e.g. , neostriatum , amygdala , and thalamus -RRB- produces marked deficits in retention of instrumentally conditioned behaviors .
8616583|Since there is a close anatomical and functional relationship between the neostriatum and the substantia nigra , it was of interest to determine whether enhanced training with a high level of footshock would prevent the reported amnesic state induced by injections of GABA antagonists into the latter structure .
861757|The extracellular responses of neurones in the neostriatum following single pulse stimulation of the substantia nigra were investigated in urethane anaesthetized rats .
862687|Effects of hyperbaric oxygenation on electrical activity of globus pallidus and neostriatum .
8627331|Several putative neurotransmitters and metabolites were monitored simultaneously in the extracellular space of neostriatum , substantia nigra , and cortex and in subcutaneous tissue of the rat by in vivo microdialysis .
8627331|The highest concentration of dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- was in the neostriatum .
8627378|The neostriatum and its connections control the sequential organization of action -LRB- `` action syntax '' -RRB- as well as simpler aspects of movement .
8627378|Small excitotoxin lesions were made using quinolinic acid at bilateral sites within the dorsolateral , dorsomedial , ventrolateral , or ventromedial neostriatum , or in the ventral pallidum or globus pallidus of rats .
8627378|Our results identified a single site within the anterior dorsolateral neostriatum , slightly more than a cubic millimeter in size -LRB- 1.3 x 1.0 x 1.0 mm -RRB- , as crucial to grooming syntax .
86377|Autoradiographic study of the development of the neostriatum in the rabbit .
86377|Fernndez V , Bravo H , Kuljis R , Fuentes I. Autoradiographic labelling has been employed to analyze the morphogenesis of the neostriatum .
86377|Careful microscopical observation of the autoradiographs shows that cellular components of the neostriatum originate between days 15 and 18 of the intrauterine life from a layer of proliferating matrix cells that lies on the floor of the anterior part of the lateral ventrical -LRB- ganglionic eminence -RRB- .
86377|From this proliferating layer , precursor cells migrate outwards to reach the developing neostriatum in a sequential fashion according to two gradients of histogenesis .
86377|Thus , it was found that neurons formed at early stages occupy a ventromedial position in the neostriatum , while those formed at later stages occupy a dorsolateral position -LRB- ventromedial to dorsolateral gradient -RRB- .
86377|Furthermore , the present study indicates that the rostral regions of the neostriatum arise somewhat later than the caudal ones , demonstrating the existence of a caudocephalic gradient of cytogenesis .
864657|Implants in the anterior hypothalamus , preopitc region , and the area of the ventral neostriatum intermediale were effective in reinstating the collection of nesting material , and in many instances restoration of the behaviour was to levels at or above those observed before castration .
8654525|During the latter half of the first trimester , the number of TH-stained cells as well as the length and number of axonal processes projecting toward and into the developing neostriatum increased rapidly .
8656212|Similarly , TH immunoreactivity in HVc was initially low relative to that in the surrounding neostriatum , then increased during development to become more intense than that in the surround by day 60 .

8703077|This double dissociation shows that the limbic-diencephalic regions damaged in amnesia and the neostriatum damaged in Parkinson 's disease support separate and parallel learning systems .
8703077|In humans , the neostriatum -LRB- caudate nucleus and putamen -RRB- is essential for the gradual , incremental learning of associations that is characteristic of habit learning .
8703077|The neostriatum is important not just for motor behavior and motor learning but also for acquiring nonmotor dispositions and tendencies that depend on new associations .
8705309|One of these areas , the caudal nucleus of the ventral neostriatum -LRB- HVC -RRB- , is sensitive to androgens and estrogens .
870904|Crude membrane fractions were prepared from the cerebral cortex and neostriatum of animals that had been sacrificed by quick freezing .
870904|These effects were greater in preparations from the neostriatum than from the cerebral cortex , and were observed in experiments using both rats and mice .

8726996|In contrast , the robust nucleus of the archistriatum -LRB- RA -RRB- and the supralaminar area of the frontal neostriatum in budgerigars , like the RA and the magnicellular nucleus of the neostriatum -LRB- MAN -RRB- in songbirds , respectively , contained few or no ChAT labeled somata , fibers , and varicosities and stained lightly for AChE .
8726996|The central nucleus of the lateral neostriatum in budgerigars , like the higher vocal center -LRB- HVC -RRB- in songbirds , contained no ChAT labeled somata , moderate densities of ChAT labeled fibers and varicosities , and moderate levels of AChE staining .
8726996|Two nuclei , the oval nucleus of the hyperstriatum ventrale -LRB- HVo -RRB- and the oval nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- NAo -RRB- , contained no ChAT labeled somata , dense ChAT labeled fibers and varicosities , and moderate to high levels of AChE staining .

8758944|The structures postsynaptic to the anterogradely labelled boutons also received input from other classes of terminals that had the morphological and neurochemical characteristics of boutons derived from the neostriatum , globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus .
8763505|These results are interpreted in the framework of a model of striatal function postulating -LRB- i -RRB- that populations of cortical and striatal neurons form distributed functional units -LRB- Hebbian cell assemblies -RRB- , and -LRB- ii -RRB- that mutual inhibition between such cortico-striatal cell assemblies is mediated by the neostriatum , the forebrain structure primarily affected in Parkinson 's disease .

8782220|Sensory and motoric components of various forms of learned movement with change in the activity of the cholinergic system of the neostriatum .
8782220|The participation of the cholinergic system of the neostriatum in the regulation of sensorily-monitored movements and the differentiation of sensory signals were investigated in 12 Wistar rats , 27 Sprague-Dawley rats , and 6 mongrel dogs , using the following models : 1 -RRB- the maintenance of learned extension of the forelimb for a specified time -LRB- rats -RRB- ; 2 -RRB- prolonged conditioned reflex flexion of the hind limb -LRB- dogs -RRB- ; and 3 -RRB- active avoidance in a T-maze -LRB- rats -RRB- .
8782220|Bilateral microinjections of carbacholine -LRB- 0.03 microgram -RRB- into the neostriatum of the rats significantly improves the development of a differentiated active avoidance conditioned reflex in a T-maze on the first three days of testing .
8782220|Thus , the data obtained in the various behavioral models and different animals suggest that the cholinergic system of the neostriatum participates in the regulation of both motor and sensory mechanisms in connection with the realization of learned movement .
8782904|The rostro-medial neostriatum/hyperstriatum ventrale -LRB- MNH -RRB- and the neostriatum dorsocaudale -LRB- Ndc -RRB- are forebrain regions which play a role in auditory filial imprinting .
8783234|Extracellular adenosine levels in neostriatum and hippocampus during rest and activity periods of rats .
8783234|Therefore , we have now used in vivo microdialysis to investigate the extracellular levels of adenosine in the neostriatum and hippocampus of freely moving rats .
8783234|In contrast to the neostriatum , extracellular levels of hippocampal adenosine tended to increase towards the end of the lights-off period , reaching its maximal level at 07.00 , and decreasing again within the following hour .
8783234|The changes of hippocampal adenosine levels were related to behavior , since significant increases in `` sleep-like '' behavior , as well as decreases in overall movements and consummatory behavior , were observed when adenosine levels had reached their maxima in the hippocampus ; no such relationship was found with respect to the neostriatum .
8783238|We examined whether , when challenged with d-amphetamine : -LRB- 1 -RRB- dopaminergic grafts transplanted into the previously denervated neonatal neostriatum lead to a normal activation of postsynaptic striatal neurons in term of immediate early genes activation ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- whether this activation is related to the action of the dopamine released from the grafts using a dopaminergic D1 antagonist .
8783238|Following a mild stress-injection of saline-c-fos expression was high in the lesioned neostriatum when compared with control animals .
8783238|Administration of d-amphetamine increased c-fos expression in the neostriatum and the globus pallidus of the control group .
8783238|The transplant reversed the effect of the lesion and , moreover , led to a c-fos over-expression in the dorsolateral neostriatum and the globus pallidus .
8783238|It is concluded that the neonatal lesion of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway , in contrast to the adult-stage lesion , modifies the reactivity of c-fos in the neostriatum to stress , presumably in relation with compensatory reorganizations occurring following the neonatal lesion .

8843077|The up-regulation of dynorphin and aspartate was only observed when there was an almost complete denervation of the neostriatum as visualized with antiserum to tyrosine hydroxylase , a marker for dopamine fibres .

8884775|Sulphated cholecystokinin-8S in the dialysis perfusate -LRB- 1-100 microM -RRB- induced a concentration-dependent increase in extracellular dynorphin B and aspartate levels , both in the neostriatum and substantia nigra .
8884775|Local cholecystokinin-4 -LRB- 100 microM -RRB- produced a moderate , but significant , increase of extracellular dynorphin B and aspartate levels in the neostriatum and substantia nigra .
8884775|Basal extracellular GABA levels were increased significantly in both the neostriatum and substantia nigra ipsilateral to the lesion .
8884775|Nigral glutamate and aspartate levels were also increased in the lesioned substantia nigra , but in the lesioned neostriatum aspartate levels were decreased .
8884775|Taken together , these results suggest that cholecystokinin-8S modulates dynorphin B and aspartate release in the neostriatum and substantia nigra of the rat via different receptor mechanisms .
8884775|In the neostriatum , the effect of cholecystokinin-8S on dynorphin B and aspartate release is mediated via the cholecystokinin-B receptor subtype , while in the substantia nigra , cholecystokinin-8S modulates dynorphin B and aspartate release via both cholecystokinin-A and cholecystokinin-B receptor subtypes .
8885196|Cells were discerned in the medial parts of the ventral hyperstriatum and neostriatum near the lateral ventricle and in dorsal and medial parts of the hippocampus .
8885196|They were most abundant in the caudal neostriatum where they clustered in the dorsomedial neostriatum , and as a band of cells coursing along the dorsal edge of the lamina archistriatalis dorsalis .
8885196|They were also present in high numbers in the ventrolateral aspect of the neostriatum and in the nucleus taeniae .
8885196|None of the telencephalic vocal control nuclei had appreciable numbers of cells immunoreactive for aromatase within their boundaries , with the possible exception of a group of cells that may correspond to the medial part of the magnocellular nucleus of the neostriatum .
8885203|Autoradiographic analysis indicated that there were no sex differences in the proportions of T or E2 target cells in two song nuclei : the high vocal center -LRB- HVC -RRB- and the lateral portion of the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- IMAN -RRB- .
8887733|To help determine the nature of serotonergic regulation of dopamine activity in the brain an in-vivo microdialysis study has been performed in conscious rats to investigate the modulation of dopamine release in the neostriatum by 5-hydroxytryptamine -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- .
8887733|The 5-HT uptake inhibitor , fluoxetine , and the 5-HT precursor , 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan -LRB- 5-HTP -RRB- , were used to produce an increase in extracellular 5-HT concentration Systemic administration of fluoxetine -LRB- 10 mg kg-1 , s.c. -RRB- produced a 2 - to 3-fold increase in extracellular 5-HT concentration but did not change extracellular dopamine concentration in the neostriatum .
8887733|Co-administration of fluoxetine and 5-HTP -LRB- 40 mg kg-1 , s.c. ; 60-90 min after fluoxetine -RRB- caused a highly significant tenfold increase in extracellular 5-HT concentration in the neostriatum with a slight but non-significant decrease in extracellular dopamine concentration .
8887733|These results demonstrate that high concentrations of extracellular 5-HT do not modulate dopamine release in the neostriatum .
8891076|The neostriatum displayed massive neuronal loss and gliosis .
8892103|Mutual inhibitory effects between dopamine and carbachol on the excitatory synaptic transmission in the rat neostriatum .
8892103|Based on these findings , we conclude that the inhibitory effects of D2 dopaminergic receptor and muscarinic receptor activation on the excitatory synaptic transmission in the neostriatum are non-additive and therefore are antagonistic interactions .
8904793|The potency of inhibitors did not vary from one region to another in the telencephalon -LRB- neocortex , hippocampus and neostriatum -RRB- but , D-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate , L-trans-pyrrolidine-2 ,4 - dicarboxylate , kainate and dihydrokainate inhibited -LSB- 3H -RSB- L-aspartate binding in the cerebellar cortex less potently than that in the forebrain .
8905740|The animals were sacrificed 2 days after the last exposure and biochemical measurements of catecholamines and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid -LRB- DOPAC -RRB- were performed in the neostriatum and substantia nigra .
8910736|Corticostriatal innervation of the patch and matrix in the rat neostriatum .
8910736|The distribution of rat corticostrial axons in the patch -LRB- striosome -RRB- and matrix compartments of the neostriatum was studied by using axonal labeling with biotinylated dextran amine -LRB- BDA -RRB- and identifying patch and matrix in the same section with calbindin immunocytochemistry .
8910736|The focal arborizations in the matrix were observed through the rostrocaudal extent of the neostriatum but were most obvious in the caudal one-third .
8910736|These results support the concept of multiple classes of corticostriatal neurons having different targets within the neostriatum , following different topographical rules , and having different but overlapping distributions across cortical areas .
8915584|Expression of NMDAR2D glutamate receptor subunit mRNA in neurochemically identified interneurons in the rat neostriatum , neocortex and hippocampus .
8915584|In the neostriatum , NMDAR2D was expressed by the interneuron populations marked by preprosomatostatin -LRB- SOM -RRB- , the 67-kDa form of glutamic acid decarboxylase -LRB- GAD67 -RRB- , parvalbumin -LRB- PARV -RRB- , and choline acetyltransferase -LRB- ChAT -RRB- mRNAs but not by the projection neurons expressing beta-preprotachykinin -LRB- SP -RRB- or preproenkephalin -LRB- ENK -RRB- mRNAs .
8915824|Dual character , asynaptic and synaptic , of the dopamine innervation in adult rat neostriatum : a quantitative autoradiographic and immunocytochemical analysis .
8915824|Descarrl@ere.umontreal.ca Dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- axon terminals -LRB- varicosities -RRB- in the neostriatum of adult rats were examined for shape , size , content , synaptic incidence , type of junction , synaptic targets , and microenvironment after electron microscopic identification either by -LSB- 3H -RSB- DA uptake autoradiography or by immunocytochemistry with monoclonal antibodies against DA-glutaraldehyde-protein conjugate .
8915824|Whether they were from the paraventricular or the mediodorsal neostriatum , respectively , the -LSB- 3H -RSB- DA-labeled and DA-immunostained varicosities were generally oblong and relatively small ; more than 60 % contained one or more mitochondria .
8915824|In such a densely DA-innervated brain region , they also lead to the hypothesis that a basal level of extracellular DA might be maintained permanently around every tissue constituent and , thus , contribute to the mechanisms of action , properties , and functions -LRB- or dysfunctions -RRB- of DA within the neostriatum itself and as part of the basal ganglia circuitry .
8915825|Abundant accumulations of neurotensin-containing cell bodies were found in the dorsolateral corticoid area , the piriform cortex , the parahippocampal area , the medial part of the frontal neostriatum , the lateral part of the caudal neostriatum , nucleus accumbens , the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis , ventral paleostriatum , the preoptic area , the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus , the inferior hypothalamic nucleus , the infundibular hypothalamic nucleus , and the mammillary nuclei .
8915831|The neostriatum , amygdaloid complex , and most hypothalamic areas express lamp mRNAs from early stages -LRB- E13-E14 -RRB- in a pattern consistent with the onset of neurogenesis .
8915841|The lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum increased in volume until 20 days and then gradually decreased to reach the adult value at about 40 days .
8915841|Whereas area X is absent in females , the high vocal center , the robust nucleus of the archistriatum , and the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum were detectable throughout development and in adulthood .
8915841|Contrary to the development of these two nuclei in females , the volumetric development of the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum was very similar in both sexes .
8915841|Females began with a smaller lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum at 10 days posthatch , which led to a sexual dimorphism in juvenile stages , but there was no sexual dimorphism of volume size in adult brains .
8922065|Neuropathological examination showed severe neuronal loss and astrocytosis with a spongy change in the frontal cortex and neostriatum .
8923517|By double anterograde tracing and immunocytochemistry at both the light and electron microscopic levels , we show that individual neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata and dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta each receive multiple GABAergic synaptic inputs both from neurons in the ventral pallidum -LRB- which receive input from limbic areas via the nucleus accumbens -RRB- and from neurons in the globus pallidus -LRB- which receive input from associative and sensorimotor cortices via the neostriatum -RRB- .
8923517|Thus , information subserving functions such as emotion , motivation , cognition and movement converges onto basal ganglia output neurons , leading eventually to the muscles , and also on to the dopaminergic neurons which themselves subserve an integrative role by modulating the flow of information from the cortex through the basal ganglia at the level of the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens .
8931001|The neostriatum is one of the areas with relatively high levels of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor -LRB- GDNF -RRB- messenger RNA expression in the developing and adult brain .
8931001|GDNF expression in the neostriatum has been suggested to be involved in promoting the survival of nigral dopaminergic neurons , acting as a target-derived neurotrophic factor .
8938751|The fluorescent retrograde tracer Fast Blue was injected into the neostriatum one -LRB- group A -RRB- or five weeks -LRB- group B -RRB- following exposure to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1 ,2,3,6 - tetrahydropyridine .
8943073|Antisense c-fos oligonucleotides injected into the neostriatum of conscious rats selectively inhibited c-fos expression associated with compensatory increases in striatal c-fos mRNA levels and also with increased expression of junB and NGFI-A mRNA , probably as a result of regulatory phenomena .
8943204|Neuronal responses in the caudomedial neostriatum -LRB- NCM -RRB- of adult zebra finches -LRB- Taeniopygia guttata -RRB- decreased upon repeated , unreinforced presentations of conspecific song , calls , or other complex sounds .
8945743|Response patterns recorded in the higher vocal center -LRB- HVC -RRB- and the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the neostriatum -LRB- IMAN -RRB- were compared .
8946281|braun@ifn-magdeburg.de The mediorostral neostriatum/hyperstriatum ventrale -LRB- MNH -RRB- and neostriatum dorsocaudale -LRB- Ndc -RRB- of the domestic chick are crucially involved in auditory filial imprinting , whereas the lobus parolfactorius -LRB- LPO -RRB- seems to be involved in the emotional modulation of behavior .
8946281|Furthermore , there are reciprocal intratelencephalic connections between distinct parts of the neostriatum caudale and the mediorostral neostriatum .
8949937|Either 3 days or 3 weeks later , slices of neostriatum were prepared , preloaded with -LSB- 3H -RSB- GABA , and superfused in order to measure -LSB- 3H -RSB- GABA overflow in response to electrical stimulation -LRB- 8 Hz -RRB- .
8949937|In non-treated or vehicle-pretreated rat neostriatum , sulpiride -LRB- 10 microM -RRB- increased the depolarization-induced -LSB- 3H -RSB- GABA overflow to 193 % of control .

8952519|Diffuse plaques found in the cerebral and cerebellar cortex , neostriatum , and hypothalamus of Down 's syndrome , Alzheimer 's disease , and nondemented brains were strongly immunoreactive for A beta N1 -LRB- L-Asp -RRB- , A beta N1 -LRB- L-isoAsp -RRB- , A beta N1 -LRB- D-Asp -RRB- , and A beta N3 -LRB- pyroGlu -RRB- and weakly positive for A beta N11 -LRB- pyroGlu -RRB- and A beta N17 -LRB- Leu -RRB- .

8971731|In vivo microdialysis was used to study the effect of secretogranin II-derived peptides on dynorphin B -LRB- Dyn B -RRB- , dopamine , gamma-aminobutyric acid -LRB- GABA -RRB- , glutamate and aspartate release in the substantia nigra and neostriatum of halothane-anaesthesized rats .
8971731|In the neostriatum , Dyn B , glutamate , aspartate and GABA levels were also increased by local secretoneurin infusion , but the effect was less prominent than in the substantia nigra .
8971731|In the neostriatum , Dyn B and GABA levels were increased by 10 microM of secretoneurin-15C .
8978730|Intranasal administration of the dopaminergic agonists L-DOPA , amphetamine , and cocaine increases dopamine activity in the neostriatum : a microdialysis study in the rat .
8978730|By using in vivo microdialysis in the urethane-anesthetized rat , it was found that unilateral intranasal administration of either of the psychostimulants led to huge and rapid increases of extracellular dopamine levels in the neostriatum followed by decreases of its metabolites dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid .
8983033|Dopaminergic function in the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens of young and aged Fischer 344 rats .
8983033|Amphetamine also induced different patterns of Fos immunoreactivity in the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens of young and aged rats , as Fos expression in aged rats exhibited a distinctive dorsal to ventral pattern of decline .
8986880|Results from anterograde and retrograde tracing experiments with biocytin and fluorescently labeled dextran amines indicate that the central nucleus of the anterior archistriatum -LRB- AAc -RRB- is the source of ascending projections upon the oval nuclei of the anterior neostriatum and ventral hyperstriatum -LRB- NAo and HVo , respectively -RRB- .
8986880|Efferent projections from the latter nuclei terminate in the lateral neostriatum afferent to AAc , thereby forming a short recurrent pathway through the pallium .
8986880|It is hypothesized that vocal control nuclei of the avian anterior neostriatum may perform a function similar to the primate supplemental motor area .

9007547|Spatial pattern of evoked synaptic excitation in the mouse neostriatum in vitro .
9007547|The spatial distribution of stimulus-evoked excitation in the mouse neostriatum was investigated in vitro by using voltage-sensitive dyes and an optical multi-site recording system -LRB- laser scanning microscopy -RRB- .
9007547|Electrical stimulation at defined positions elicited characteristic spatial patterns of activity within the neostriatum .
9007547|These results , obtained in an in vitro slice preparation , demonstrate that spatially defined afferent activation of neostriatal neuronal circuits leads to a characteristic pattern of activity distribution within the neostriatum .
9010328|In situ hybridization histochemistry revealed strong labelling in the infundibular region of the hypothalamus , preoptic area , and medial caudal neostriatum .
9011384|Positive cells were observed also in the neostriatum , including the main auditory area -LRB- field L -RRB- , in several nuclei of the archistriatum and in the hyperstriatum -LRB- accessory , dorsal , and ventral -RRB- .
9015321|Changes of neuronal responsiveness in the mediorostral neostriatum/hyperstriatum after auditory filial imprinting in the domestic chick .
9015321|In in vivo electrophysiological studies , we analysed whether imprinting alters the responsiveness of neurons to acoustic imprinting stimuli in the mediorostral neostriatum/hyperstriatum ventrale .
9015321|We compared the response characteristics of neurons in the mediorostral neostriatum/hyperstriatum ventrale in freely behaving or anesthetized acoustically imprinted , non-imprinted -LRB- naive controls -RRB- and passive control chicks -LRB- stimulus-exposed -RRB- during presentation of either the imprinting stimulus or an unfamiliar discrimination stimulus .
9015321|In acoustically imprinted chicks , the multiunit activity in anesthetized chicks and the fast Fourier transform power spectrum in freely behaving chicks in the mediorostral neostriatum/hyperstriatum ventrale were significantly changed during playback of the learned stimulus in comparison to spontaneous activity and compared to the activity during playback of the unfamiliar discrimination stimulus .
9015321|These results indicate that neurons in the mediorostral neostriatum/hyperstriatum ventrale change their responsiveness towards learned , behaviorally relevant stimuli during auditory filial imprinting .
9021897|The relation between the two parameters was examined in 1 -RRB- the normal cingulate cortex ; 2 -RRB- the neostriatum severely DA-denervated by unilateral intramesencephalic injections of 6-hydroxydopamine ; and 3 -RRB- the neostriatum , partly DA-reinnervated by an intrastriatal graft of fetal mesencephalic neurons after prior 6-hydroxydopamine lesion .
9021897|The regression lines for intact cortex and for DA-denervated as well as DA-reinnervated neostriatum had the same slope and crossed the ordinate near zero .
9021897|Providing that the hyperdense DA innervation of the normal neostriatum does not generate a particular problem in vivo as it does in vitro .
9021899|The present experiments show that dopaminergic presynaptic modulation of glutamatergic transmission in the neostriatum does not affect all stimulated afferents , suggesting that it is selective towards some of them .
9025115|These results specified the parietal areas involved in a purely cognitive spatial process and demonstrated a close interaction between these areas and the anterior neostriatum and certain lateral frontal cortical areas in the discrimination of rotated forms of stimuli .
9027876|They indicate that this dense serotonin input to the substantia nigra is very precisely organized , acting through both `` non-junctional '' and `` junctional '' modes of neurotransmission in the pars compacta , which projects to the neostriatum and the limbic system , whereas the predominant mode of serotonin transmission appears to be of the `` junctional '' type in the pars reticulata , where serotonin can finely control the motor output of the basal ganglia by acting on the GABA projection neurons either directly or through the local release of dopamine by dopaminergic dendrites .
9041559|DA D1 and D2 receptors were labelled with -LSB- 3H -RSB- SCH23390 and -LSB- 3H -RSB- raclopride , respectively , and measured in the neostriatum by binding studies , and in autoradiograms of forebrain sections by quantitative densitometry .
9041559|The autoradiographic measurements revealed significant increases in the densities of D2 receptors in nucleus accumbens , in the medio-ventral , latero-dorsal and latero-ventral quadrants of the rostral neostriatum , in caudal neostriatum and in globus pallidus of both HAL - -LRB- 28-44 % -RRB- and CLZ-treated -LRB- 15-85 % -RRB- animals .
9041559|The HAL-induced up-regulation of D2 receptors in rostral and caudal neostriatum was homogenous , but CLZ produced a more uneven increase , with the highest absolute densities measured in latero-dorsal neostriatum , as well as with changes in the medio-dorsal rostral neostriatum .
9041559|For D1 receptors , only CLZ and not HAL , produced significant increases in five regions , namely nucleus accumbens -LRB- 43 % -RRB- latero-dorsal rostral neostriatum -LRB- 16 % -RRB- , caudal neostriatum -LRB- 30 % -RRB- , globus pallidus -LRB- 67 % -RRB- and substantia nigra -LRB- 12 % -RRB- .

9109118|Model of the function of the neostriatum and its neuronal activity during behavior in monkeys .
9109118|Experiments with simultaneous recording of six neostriatum neurons showed that the neurons of this structure are involved in the organization of all stages of behavior .
9109118|These data , along with the established properties of neuronal responses in the neural network model , indicate that the integration of afferent signals in the neostriatum and their distribution to efferent connections is based on network mechanisms of neuronal interactions .
9109119|Role of the cholinergic system of the neostriatum in regulating several forms of defensive behavior .
9109119|It would appear that the neostriatum is not involved in the behavioral reactions in either of these situations , and this may result primarily from low levels of neuronal activity in response to these signals .
9115667|Binding sites for NPY are localized with high density in the different subdivisions of the neostriatum and the hyperstriatum , the cerebellum , the nucleus septalis lateralis and medialis , the nucleus ruber and the nucleus tractus solitarii .

9120583|We conclude that two types of GABAergic terminals exist in the rat neostriatum , only one of which is regulated by GABAB receptors .
9130783|While previous studies indirectly suggested that hyperexcitation due to deafferentation from the neostriatum may be a major underlying mechanism in delayed degeneration of substantia nigra pars reticulata neurons after middle cerebral artery occlusion , the present electrophysiological experiments provide evidence of hyperexcitation in substantia nigra pars compacta neurons but not in pars reticulata neurons at the chronic phase of striatal infarction .

9135049|Dopamine and adenylate cyclase phosphoprotein-32 messenger RNA was detected within the neostriatum but not within the septum .
9135049|By contrast , the hybridization signals for proneurotensin and enkephalin , and proneurotensin and dopamine and adenylate cyclase phosphoprotein-32 were generally coincident , at least within the neostriatum ; most proneurotensin messenger RNA-positive cells expressed enkephalin messenger RNA and were also positive for dopamine and adenylate cyclase phosphoprotein-32 messenger RNA .
9135059|In the forebrain of the domestic chick -LRB- Gallus gallus domesticus -RRB- , an area termed the mediorostral neostriatum/hyperstriatum ventrale is strongly involved in emotional learning paradigms such as acoustic filial imprinting .
9135059|Furthermore , the involvement of the mediorostral neostriatum/hyperstriatum ventrale in stressful situations , such as social separation , has been demonstrated in 2-deoxyglucose studies .
9135059|A small , but statistically significant , decrease of extracellular homovanillic acid levels was found in the mediorostral neostriatum/hyperstriatum ventrale of imprinted chicks compared to control animals , whereas changes of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were not detected .
9135059|In a second experiment , we investigated the levels of homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the mediorostral neostriatum/hyperstriatum ventrale of socially reared chicks during different stress situations , such as handling or separation from their cage mates .
9135059|These results provide the first evidence that the physiological response of the mediorostral neostriatum/hyperstriatum ventrale related to different emotional conditions after acoustic imprinting and during stressful situations is , at least in part , mediated by dopaminergic and/or serotonergic pathways .

9215710|Role of the dorso-caudal neostriatum in filial imprinting of the domestic chick : a pharmacological and autoradiographical approach focused on the involvement of NMDA-receptors .
9215710|Compared to naive control animals , both groups of imprinted chicks expressed significantly enhanced stimulus evoked 2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose -LRB- 2-FDG -RRB- uptake in circumscribed areas of the dorso-caudal neostriatum -LRB- Ndc -RRB- .
9215710|However , pharmacological blockade of NMDA-receptors in the dorso-caudal neostriatum leads to a marked suppression of stimulus-evoked 2-FDG uptake in the dorso-caudal neostriatum and also in the interconnected imprinting relevant forebrain area , medio-rostral neostriatum/hyperstriatum ventrale -LRB- MNH -RRB- .
9215710|These results indicate that the dorso-caudal neostriatum may represent a polysensory associative brain region in which visual and acoustic features of imprinting objects may be integrated .
9215720|In the neostriatum , labeled neurons were more numerous in the rostral nucleus accumbens than in the caudal nucleus accumbens and were more numerous in the ventral and ventrolateral caudate-putamen than in the dorsal caudate-putamen , where labeled neurons were restricted to isolated clusters .
9221930|The present study examined the effects of prolonged L-DOPA treatment -LRB- 6 months -RRB- alone or in combination with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-induced lesion of the mesostriatal dopaminergic pathway on substance P and enkephalin mRNA expression in the rat neostriatum .
9221930|As reported previously , the unilateral dopaminergic lesion induced a significant and homogeneous decrease in striatal substance P mRNA expression and a marked increase in enkephalin mRNA expression in the ipsilateral neostriatum which was more pronounced in the dorsolateral than ventromedial part of the structure .
9221930|The chronic L-DOPA treatment in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats was found to partially reverse the lesion-induced down-regulation of substance P mRNA expression , without significantly affect the up-regulation of enkephalin when considering the neostriatum as a whole .
9221930|Topographical analysis revealed that long-term L-DOPA treatment reversed , in fact , both post-lesional enkephalin and substance P responses to 6-hydroxydopamine lesion , in the ventromedial neostriatum , without significantly modified these peptide responses in the dorsolateral neostriatum .
9221930|These findings provide new evidence that prolonged L-DOPA treatment differentially affects the post-lesional peptide responses in the ventromedial and dorsolateral parts of the neostriatum , suggesting regional cellular mechanisms in the neostriatum underlying the benefit and/or side-effects of L-DOPA treatment in parkinsonian patients .
9222530|Perinatal exposure to delta 9-THC decreased the levels of 5-HT in hypothalamus and rostral neostriatum in exposed males , and also decreased the levels of 5-HT in ventral hippocampus , septum , and midbrain raphe nuclei in both exposed males and females .

9225758|Neurons in the dorsal neostriatum are highly vulnerable to transient cerebral ischemia .
9225758|It has been suggested that excessive dopamine release during ischemia may play an important role in the pathogenesis of postischemic cell death in the neostriatum .
9225758|However , it remains controversial whether depletion of dopamine protects neurons in the neostriatum against ischemic insult .
9225758|Under our experimental conditions , ischemia that produces approximately 21 min ischemic depolarization caused more than 90 % of cell death in the dorsolateral neostriatum .
9225758|No difference was found between the number of surviving neurons in the left and the right neostriatum after depletion of dopamine on the left side .
9225758|In contrast , surviving neurons dramatically increased in the right neostriatum after depletion of dopamine on the right side .
9239761|To further understand the gamma-amino-butyric acid -LRB- GABA -RRB- - dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- interactions in the neostriatum we have carried out experiments to explore whether an activation of the GABA -LRB- A -RRB- receptor could affect the binding characteristics of the D2 DA receptor in membrane preparations of the rat neostriatum .
9243519|The results suggest that in the rat neostriatum not only CCK-B receptors , but also CCK-A receptors seem to mediate the effects of cholecystokinin .

9278098|Following chronic Li + treatment -LRB- 28 days -RRB- , the labelling to DA transporters increased -LRB- 60-90 % -RRB- in all sections of the rostral and caudal neostriatum , whereas no alteration was observed in the other regions studied , namely the substantia nigra , the ventral tegmental area , and the dorsal raphe nucleus .
9278533|The highest levels of IGF-II mRNA expression occurred in three nuclei of the song system : in the high vocal center -LRB- HVC -RRB- , in the medial magnocellular nucleus of the neostriatum -LRB- mMAN -RRB- , which projects to HVC , and to a lesser extent in the robust nucleus of the archistriatum -LRB- RA -RRB- , which receives projections from HVC .
9284355|Because there are GABAergic projections from neostriatum to entopeduncular nucleus -LRB- medial globus pallidus -RRB- and substantia nigra pars reticulata , the GABA agonist muscimol was injected directly into these structures to study the effects of GABA stimulation on tacrine-induced jaw movements .

9300427|Finally , in order to test for the presence of fixed GABA in sub-type of anterogradely-labelled terminals in the neostriatum , ultrathin sections were immunolabelled by the post-embedding immunogold method .
9300427|The density of tyrosine hydroxylase labelling in the neostriatum prevented the classification of immunolabelled nigrostriatal axons .
9303243|These data support the view that the rodent neostriatum is important in the control of behavioral sequences for psychomotor function and at the same time demonstrate the utility of new quantitative behavioral methods for investigating such functions .
9305813|These morphological changes correlate with previous studies suggesting striatopallidal boutons are more active after destruction of dopaminergic input to the neostriatum .

9339865|The developmental pattern of GluR1 was similar to that of GluR2-3 in the BG , but the immunoreactivity to GluR1 was a little weaker than that of GluR2-3 in the neostriatum .
9351509|Kappa1 - and kappa2-opioid receptors mediating presynaptic inhibition of dopamine and acetylcholine release in rat neostriatum .
9351509|In conclusion , whereas activation of kappa1-opioid receptors causes presynaptic inhibition of NMDA-induced dopamine release , kappa2 receptor activation results in inhibition of ACh release in rat neostriatum .

9353417|Differential regulation of D2 and D4 dopamine receptor mRNAs in the primate cerebral cortex vs. neostriatum : effects of chronic treatment with typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs .
9353417|The RNase Protection Assay was used to examine the regulation of D2 and D4 dopamine receptor mRNAs in the cerebral cortex and neostriatum of nonhuman primates after chronic treatment with a wide spectrum of antipsychotic medications -LRB- chlorpromazine , clozapine , haloperidol , molindone , olanzapine , pimozide , remoxipride and risperidone -RRB- .
9353417|The same drug treatments produced less uniform effects in the neostriatum than in the cortex : clozapine and olanzapine failed to significantly elevate either D2-long or D2-short receptor messages in this structure unlike all other drugs , including tiapride .
9353417|The finding that up-regulation of D2 dopamine receptor mRNAs was a consistently observed effect of a wide range of antipsychotic agents in the cerebral cortex but not in the neostriatum , coupled with the fact that the D2-short isoforms in the cortex were not regulated by a nonantipsychotic D2 antagonist , tiapride , draws attention to the importance of the D2 dopamine receptor in the cerebral cortex as a potentially critical , common site of action of antipsychotic medications .
9355111|Specifically , whereas stress-induced dopamine release in the neostriatum is mediated by an action of glutamate on the dopamine cell body , stress-induced dopamine synthesis in the neostriatum is mediated by an action of glutamate on the dopamine nerve terminal .
9356512|Although auditory neurons in the song nucleus HVc and the underlying neostriatum of fledglings did not prefer conspecific song over foreign song , some neurons responded strongly to particular phrase types characteristic of white-crowned sparrows and , thus , could contribute to innate song recognition .

9357014|This study investigates the effects of different muscarinic receptor agonists on extracellular glutamate and aspartate concentrations in the rat neostriatum .
9357014|These results suggest that the decrease in extracellular -LSB- ASP -RSB- could be mediated , at least in part , by M1 muscarinic receptor activation in the rat neostriatum .
9359604|Histamine modulates NMDA-dependent swelling in the neostriatum .

9364241|In a second series of rats with stab wounds in the neostriatum , there were substantially larger GFAP inductions than after deafferentation , but fewer effects of age .
9364244|Particular attention was paid to two forebrain regions , the mediorostral neostriatum / hyperstriatum ventrale -LRB- MNH -RRB- and neostriatum dorsocaudale -LRB- Ndc -RRB- , which have been shown to be crucially involved in filial imprinting .
9364477|Inhibition of release via P2-receptors has been previously shown for noradrenaline -LRB- brain cortex and hippocampus -RRB- and dopamine -LRB- neostriatum -RRB- and , hence , may be widespread .
9367247|We examined whether dopamine depletion in the medial prefrontal cortex of the rat differentially affects basal and evoked dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid -LRB- DOPAC -RRB- content in the subareas of the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens .
9367247|Loss of approximately 80 % of tissue dopamine content in the medial prefrontal cortex did not significantly alter basal tissue concentrations of dopamine or DOPAC or the DOPAC : dopamine ratio in either the nucleus accumbens core or shell or the medial or lateral neostriatum .
9369467|Consistent with a role in processing auditory information , two nuclei of the AF , the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- IMAN -RRB- and Area X -LRB- X -RRB- , contain some of the most complex auditory neurons known .
9372201|Previous reports have documented changes in dopamine levels in the neostriatum in experimental hydrocephalus .
9372201|The numbers of choline acetyltransferase -LRB- ChAT -RRB- - and glutamic acid decarboxylase -LRB- GAD -RRB- - immunoreactive -LRB- IR -RRB- neostriatal neurons and tyrosine hydroxylase -LRB- TH -RRB- - IR nigral neurons , were counted in 60-micron thick representative sections and the IR cellular densities -LRB- counted cell number/neostriatal area -RRB- were calculated in the neostriatum .
9372201|These findings suggest that progressive hydrocephalus results in functional injuries of cholinergic and GABAergic neurons in the neostriatum and dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra compacta by mechanical distortion .
9372552|In a previous study , performed with in vivo microdialysis in the anesthetized rat , we have shown that intranasal L-DOPA administration -LRB- without prior decarboxylase inhibition -RRB- can increase extracellular dopamine levels in the neostriatum .
9372552|In accordance with other data , it was found that the combination of i.p. benserazide and i.p. L-DOPA led to pronounced increases of extracellular levels of dopamine , dihydroxyplenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid in the neostriatum , whereas i.p.

9380067|After his death by aspiration , examination of his brain revealed abnormalities limited to the neostriatum .
9380067|This patient represents only the fourth case -LRB- and first North American born -RRB- with a mosaic pattern of gliosis in the neostriatum .
9383003|Iontophoresis of amphetamine in the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens of awake , unrestrained rats .
9383003|When administered systemically to ambulant animals , amphetamine -LRB- AMPH -RRB- has both excitatory and inhibitory effects on single-unit activity in the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens .
9383206|These results suggest that in the neostriatum the neurotensin receptor located postsynaptically on the striatopallidal GABA neurons seems to differ from the neurotensin receptor located on dopaminergic terminals , as indicated by the relative lack of effect of NT -LRB- 8-13 -RRB- on striatal dopamine release .
9383516|Of 2 groups of pigeons , 1 -LRB- n = 6 -RRB- received ablations of the postero-dorso-lateral neostriatum -LRB- PDLNS -RRB- as well as the corticoid , and the other -LRB- n = 8 -RRB- was sham operated .
9389182|Many of the new neurons confined in neostriatum medialis and pars caudalis of telencephalon , where the rate of neurogenesis in intact dove is very low .
9390518|Basal expression was elevated within auditory telencephalon -LRB- specifically , within the caudomedial neostriatum -LSB- NCM -RSB- -RRB- during song acquisition .
9391176|No age difference or correlations with behavior were found for concentrations of PKCgamma in a comparison structure , the neostriatum , or for PKCalpha in the hippocampus .
939821|Most fibers turn laterally at the lateral hypothalamus and enter the neostriatum via the dorsal part of the subthalamic nucleus , the zona incerta and the capsula interna .
9399695|Anatomically , a tight interaction exists within the neostriatum between the opioid peptide -LRB- dynorphin and enkephalin -RRB- system and classical neurotransmitters such as dopamine which has been implicated in both the psychotic symptoms and the cognitive deficits that characterize schizophrenia -LRB- see review -RRB- .
9399695|The neostriatum is differentially organized into patch and matrix neurochemical mosaic compartments anatomically connected to limbic - and sensorimotor-related brain regions , respectively .
9399695|Moreover , the human neostriatum is characterized by a heterogenous expression of the prodynorphin opioid gene : high in the patch , but low in the matrix compartment .
9401744|At the light microscopic level , intense immunoreactivity was apparent in the cerebral cortex , hippocampus , matrix compartment of the neostriatum , cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain , cerebellar Purkinje cells , and substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord .
9406228|Effects of the cholinergic system of the rat neostriatum on learning active escape in normal animals and in animals with lesions to the intralaminar thalamic nuclei .
9406228|The following results were obtained using 57 Sprague-Dawley rats divided into a number of experimental groups : 1 -RRB- bilateral microinjection of carbacholine -LRB- 0.03 microgram -RRB- into the neostriatum on days 4 , 5 , and 6 of training produced significant -LRB- p < 0.01 -RRB- increases in the proportion of correct discriminant CAER performances ; 2 -RRB- bilateral lesioning of the Pf nuclei led to irreversible disruption of the previously learned CAER .
9406228|Rats with initially bilaterally lesioned Pf nuclei did not learn the discriminant CAER at all after 10 days of training -LRB- 16 combinations -RRB- , and microinjection of carbacholine into the neostriatum of these animals was ineffective .
9406228|It is concluded that the integrity of the afferent input into the Pf nuclei of the thalamus is an important factor for activation of the neuronal background of the neostriatum , and is required for cholinergic activation of the neostriatum to be effective .
9406950|Immunohistochemistry with an antibody against NAAG was performed on control , Huntington 's disease -LRB- HD -RRB- and Alzheimer 's disease -LRB- AD -RRB- human autopsy and biopsy brain sections from the cerebral cortex , hippocampus , amygdala , neostriatum , brainstem and spinal cord .
9406950|In the two pathologic brain regions examined , the HD neostriatum and the AD temporal cortex , we observed a widespread loss of NAAG-LI neurons .
941552|-LSB- Characteristics of the background activity of neurons of the torus , frontal and caudal regions of the chicken neostriatum -RSB- .
941552|Neurons of torus semicircularis , frontal and caudal neostriatum of hen are characterized by different mean frequencies of background activity , which comprise correspondingly 11.7 , 4.7 and 2.1 impulse/sec .

9416916|Birthdate of PV neurons is determined in the adult neostriatum and nucleus accumbens by using a BrdU-PV double-labeling immunohistochemical technique .
9416916|PV-immunoreactive interneurons of the neostriatum show maximum birthrates -LRB- > 10 % double-labeling -RRB- between E14-E17 , whereas PV-immunoreactive interneurons of the nucleus accumbens show maximum double-labeling between E16-E19 .
9416916|In the neostriatum , caudal PV-immunoreactive neurons are born before those at rostral levels , and lateral PV-immunoreactive neurons become postmitotic before medial neurons .
9416916|At corresponding coronal levels , PV-immunoreactive neurons of the nucleus accumbens are born shortly after PV neurons of the neostriatum .
9416916|Compared with cholinergic interneurons of the neostriatum , PV-immunoreactive interneurons are born later , but neurogenetic gradients are similar .
9421837|descarrl@alize.ere.umontreal.ca Recent immunoelectron microscopic studies have revealed a low frequency of synaptic membrane differentiations on ACh -LRB- ChAT-immunostained -RRB- axon terminals -LRB- boutons or varicosities -RRB- in adult rat cerebral cortex , hippocampus and neostriatum , suggesting that , besides synaptic transmission , diffuse transmission by ACh prevails in many regions of the CNS .
9424230|-LSB- The spatial organization of the cortical and subcortical afferent projections of the neostriatum in the dog -RSB- .
9439796|Whereas dopamine failed to change in the core region of the accumbens and overlying neostriatum , an abrupt increase occurred in accumbal shell , a limbic-related area implicated in goal-directed behavior .
9456172|In the neostriatum , punctate mGluR1a immunoreactivity -LRB- ir -RRB- was present in the neuropil .
9456172|In the neostriatum , these puncta were abundant ; unlike mGluR1a , many mGluR2/3-ir puncta colocalized with SV2-ir , and striatal mGluR2/3-ir puncta were markedly reduced in number after decortication .
9456172|In contrast , mGluR1a appears to be a postsynaptic receptor of neurons in the neostriatum , globus pallidus , and substantia nigra pars reticulata .
9460703|For dystonia musculorum mice , the labelling presented no differences between controls and mutants , except for decreases in the dorsal half of caudal neostriatum and in the ventral tegmental area .
9460703|Moreover , in this mutant the left rostral neostriatum DA transporters were reduced , when compared to the right counterpart .
9460703|In weaver heterozygote -LRB- wv / + -RRB- mice , the distribution and density gradients of -LSB- 125I -RSB- RTI-121 labelling were similar as in their controls , except in caudal neostriatum , where binding was slightly higher .
9460703|In contrast , the weaver homozygote -LRB- wv/wv -RRB- showed important decreases in labelling of the dorsal quadrant of rostral neostriatum as well as of the dorsal half of caudal neostriatum , where the reductions of binding densities were of 65 % to 70 % , respectively .
9462876|Cellular localization of GluR1 , GluR2/3 and GluR4 glutamate receptor subunits in neurons of the rat neostriatum .
9462876|Glutamate excitocytotoxicity is implied in the cause of neuronal degeneration in the neostriatum , in which the toxicity may be mediated by different families of glutamate receptors .
9462876|These results indicate that GluR1 and GluR4 immunoreactivity is displayed only in the GABAergic interneurons in the neostriatum .
9463450|The results presented here show that the AAr receives afferent input from Field L both directly and indirectly via the caudolateral neostriatum .
9464997|In the neostriatum , neocortex , and hippocampus , nNOS-labeled neurons exhibit strong NMDAR1 immunoreactivity -LRB- - ir -RRB- .
9472401|In conclusion , our results suggest that -LRB- i -RRB- dopamine agonists can exert an excitatory influence on depolarization-induced GABA release within neostriatum via D1 receptors and an inhibitory influence via D2 receptors ; -LRB- ii -RRB- under the conditions of these experiments , endogenous dopamine fails to act on D1 sites but does exert an inhibitory influence via D2 sites ; and -LRB- iii -RRB- there is an interaction between D1 and D2 receptors such that the actions of dopamine mediated via D1 sites are inhibited as a result of the concomitant actions exerted via D2 sites .
9473582|Effects were measured in hippocampus , hypothalamus , amygdala , frontal cortex , neostriatum , thalamus , raphe nuclei and cerebellum .
9473582|At the protein level amounts of Galphao decreased significantly -LRB- P < 0.01 -RRB- in neostriatum and Gbeta increased in frontal cortex in response to both drug treatments .
9473582|At the mRNA level amounts of Galphai1 increased significantly -LRB- P < 0.01 -RRB- in neostriatum .
9473582|We conclude frontal cortex and neostriatum are important target regions of long-term treatment with either lithium or carbamazepine and suggest Galphao , Galphas , Galphai1 and Gbeta to be selective target molecules .
9482270|The dopamine D1 receptors , labeled with -LSB- 3H -RSB- SCH23390 , increased in nucleus accumbens , latero-dorsal rostral neostriatum and substantia nigra , after clozapine but not haloperidol .
9482270|The dopamine D2 receptors , studied with -LSB- 3H -RSB- raclopride , increased in nucleus accumbens and in dorso-lateral , ventro-medial and dorso-medial quadrants of the rostral neostriatum after either haloperidol or clozapine treatments , and also in latero-ventral rostral neostriatum but only after haloperidol .
9482270|Haloperidol also up-regulated D2 receptors in rostral and caudal neostriatum , but clozapine produced a more uneven increase , especially in caudal neostriatum .
9483560|Secondary sensory and tertiary areas of the neostriatum contained numbers of labelled neurons comparable to that of the basal ganglia and intermediate levels of neuropil staining .
9483560|Approximately up to one-third of DARPP-32-positive neurons received a basket-type innervation from tyrosine hydroxylase-positive fibres in the lateral and caudal neostriatum , but only about half as many did in the medial and frontal neostriatum , and even less so in the hyperstriatum .
9487047|-LSB- The administration of fenamine into the rostral and caudal sections of the rat neostriatum disturbs the realization of conditioned reflex escape behavior -RSB- .
9487047|Daily injections of amphetamine during 3 weeks into the rat caudal and rostral neostriatum impaired avoidance conditioning of rats in shuttle box .
9487047|The data obtained suggests involvement of both parts of the neostriatum 's dopaminergic system in avoidance conditioning and complex behavioural actions in rats .
9489707|Most striking is the 5-HT hyperinnervation of the adult neostriatum , associated with increases in density of various 5-HT receptor subtypes and enhanced neuronal responsiveness to the iontophoretic application of 5-HT and its 5-HT -LRB- 1B/2C -RRB- and 5-HT -LRB- 2A/2C -RRB- receptor agonists , m-chlorophenylpiperazine and iododimethoxyphenylaminopropane .
9489707|D1 receptor binding is known to be slightly reduced in the rostral neostriatum of these rats , a down-regulation apparently imputable to a reduced rate of synthesis of the receptor .
9489707|In contrast , D2 receptor binding is increased throughout the DA-denervated and 5-HT-hyperinnervated neostriatum , perhaps due to some posttranscriptional modifications .
9502834|The neostriatum controls behavioral sequencing , or action syntax , as well as simpler aspects of movement .
9502834|Yet the precise nature of the neostriatums role in sequencing remains unclear .
9502834|Neuronal activity of 41 % of cells in the dorsolateral and ventromedial neostriatum coded the sequential pattern of syntactic chains .
9502834|Sequential coding differed between the dorsolateral and ventromedial neostriatum .
9502834|These data demonstrate that neostriatal neurons code abstract properties of serial order for natural movement and support the hypothesis that the dorsolateral neostriatum plays a special role in implementing action syntax .
9514283|Although ample evidence implicates the dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- projection to the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens in motor and motivational processes , relatively little information is available on how DA alters neostriatal or accumbal functions under naturally occurring behavioral conditions .
9514283|Single-unit recording has revealed that amphetamine , a widely abused psychomotor stimulant , activates motor - , but inhibits nonmotor-related neurons in neostriatum and nucleus accumbens .
9514283|Neither accumbal core nor the overlying neostriatum showed a novelty-related DA change .
9514511|Organizing principles of cortical integration in the rat neostriatum : corticostriate map of the body surface is an ordered lattice of curved laminae and radial points .
9514523|NE turnover rates changed significantly over development in all six VCN -LSB- nucleus interfacialis -LRB- Nlf -RRB- , high vocal center -LRB- HVC -RRB- , nucleus robustus of the archistriatum -LRB- RA -RRB- , dorsomedial portion of the intercollicular nucleus -LRB- DM -RRB- , Area X of the parolfactory lobe , and lateral portion of the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- IMAN -RRB- -RSB- ; one AN -LSB- nucleus mesencephalicus lateralis pars dorsalis -LRB- MLd -RRB- -RSB- , and one HN -LSB- preopticus anterior -LRB- POA -RRB- -RSB- .
9518270|In the telencephalon -LRB- mostly the neostriatum -RRB- , all TH-ir fibers were found to be part of fiber groups that surrounded weakly immunoreactive aromatase cells .
9518273|Subpopulations of mostly large neurons scattered throughout the neostriatum gave moderate signals for GAP-43 and N-CAM mRNAs and a stronger signal for L1 mRNAs .
9518689|Histopathologically , the widespread neuronal degeneration was observed in the cerebral neocortex , neostriatum , red nucleus , brainstem , cerebellum and spinal dorsal root ganglia on day 32 .
9522375|In adult lesioned rats , destruction of dopaminergic innervation of the neostriatum induced initially an ipsilateral bias as measured in the `` tail hang test '' and the Y-maze .
9527544|The cellular localization of the dopaminergic D2 receptor -LRB- D2R -RRB- mRNA and protein was determined during postnatal development , from birth to 35 days , in the rat neostriatum by in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry .
9527544|D2R gene expression appeared during neuronal migration and followed the developmental pattern of neuronal settling within the neostriatum .
9530917|In particular , we discuss two natural paradigms of postnatal neuronal recruitment : radial-cell-directed neuronal migration to the songbird neostriatum , and neurophilic migration to the rodent olfactory bulb .
9541955|-LSB- Correlates of sequential elements of bimanual behavior in the neuronal activity of the monkey neostriatum -RSB- .
9550149|Birds that heard the playbacks and did not sing in response showed increased ZENK protein levels in auditory brain areas , including the caudomedial neostriatum and hyperstriatum ventrale , fields L1 and L3 , the shelf adjacent to the high vocal center -LRB- HVC -RRB- , the cup adjacent to the nucleus robustus archistriatalis -LRB- RA -RRB- , and the nucleus mesencephalicus lateralis pars dorsalis -LRB- MLd -RRB- .
9556034|In situ hybridization in rat and mouse demonstrates that RGS9 mRNA is expressed predominantly in medium-sized , spiny neurons of the neostriatum and in neurons of the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle .

9566505|h 13768 har@ella.hu The effects of cholinergic drugs and the interaction between cholinergic and dopaminergic compounds were studied on electrically evoked -LSB- 3H -RSB- gamma-aminobutyric acid -LRB- GABA -RRB- overflow in slices of the rat neostriatum .
9566505|These data indicate that the release of GABA in the neostriatum is under the control of M1 stimulatory and M3 inhibitory muscarinic receptors .
9570718|Moreover , no neurochemical alterations occurred in the brain stem , thalamus , or neostriatum of Lurcher mutants .
9570791|NMDA increased extracellular choline levels four - to fivefold in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus , produced a slight increase in neostriatum , and did not modify dialysate choline in cerebellum .
9572282|Dizocilpine treatment for 8 days enhanced the rates of DOPA decarboxylation and dopamine oxidation -LRB- monoamine oxidation -RRB- 4 - and 16-fold , respectively , in neostriatum and 10 - and 3-fold , respectively , in frontal cortex .
9578403|Postnatal development of excitatory synaptic input to the rat neostriatum : an electron microscopic study .
9578403|The distribution and density of asymmetric synapses including biocytin-labelled corticostriatal synapses of the rat neostriatum were examined at postnatal day 10 -LRB- P10 -RRB- , P15 , P21 and in adults .
9578403|The density of asymmetric synapses in the adult neostriatum -LRB- 28.0 synapses/100 microm2 -RRB- was significantly greater than that in neonates at P15 -LRB- 14.4 synapses/100 microm2 -RRB- and P10 -LRB- 11.5 synapses/100 microm2 -RRB- , but not at P21 -LRB- 24.2 + / -1.5 synapses/100 microm2 -RRB- .
9578403|The increased density of asymmetric synapses in the adult neostriatum was due primarily to an increase in the number of axospinous synapses .
9578403|Iontophoretic injection of biocytin into the lateral frontal agranular cortex produced labelling of corticostriatal afferents which formed asymmetric synapses in the neostriatum .
9578403|These changes in excitatory synaptic input to medium spiny neurons may explain some of the previously described electrophysiological differences noted between the neonatal and adult neostriatum .
9579788|The thalamic nuclei innervated by adrenaline are connected to widespread limbic and associative cortical areas as well as to subcortical structures , in particular the neostriatum and amygdala .
9582211|Regulation of action-potential firing in spiny neurons of the rat neostriatum in vivo .
9582211|Both silent and spontaneously firing spiny projection neurons have been described in the neostriatum , but the reason for their differences in firing activity are unknown .
9582233|In passerine songbirds , the lateral portion of the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- LMAN -RRB- plays a vital role in song learning , possibly by encoding sensory information and providing sensory feedback to the vocal motor system .
958522|Neuron responses in the chicken torus and caudal neostriatum to signals with different ecological significance -LRB- tones `` white '' noise , species-specific signals -RRB- were studied .
9593824|The present study examined -LRB- 1 -RRB- whether the neostriatum is involved in a drug-induced conditioned locomotor response and ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- whether this structure participates in the development of behavioral sensitization .
9593824|Rats received injections of either apomorphine -LRB- 2 microg -RRB- or vehicle -LRB- solution of 0.1 % ascorbate/saline -RRB- into the dorsal neostriatum daily for 7 days .
9593824|These results suggest that the neostriatum is directly involved in the development of drug-induced conditioning of locomotor behavior but not in the establishment of behavioral sensitization .
9596530|Among these areas , a distinct part of the dorsocaudal neostriatal complex -LRB- dNC complex -RRB- , termed neostriatum dorsocaudale -LRB- Ndc -RRB- , was recently discovered by its enhanced metabolic activity during the presentation of auditory and visual imprinting stimuli .
9596530|Special emphasis was put on the connections of the dNC complex with other imprinting relevant regions in the rostral telencephalon , such as the mediorostral neostriatum/hyperstriatum ventrale -LRB- MNH -RRB- and the intermediate and medial part of the hyperstriatum ventrale -LRB- IMHV -RRB- .
9596530|The most medial part of the dNC complex , termed neostriatum dorsale -LRB- Nd -RRB- , is characterized by strong reciprocal connections with the neostriatal part of the MNH and by its auditory related inputs , including those from the output layers L1 and L3 of field L , and the shell region of the thalamic n. ovoidalis .
9596530|The Ndc , which occupies the central aspects of the dNC complex , is mainly characterized by reciprocal connections with the ectostriatal belt -LRB- Ep -RRB- and the adjacent neostriatum -LRB- N -RRB- .
9596530|The most lateral aspect of the dNC complex , termed Ndl , is characterized by afferents from the neostriatum frontale , pars trigeminalis -LRB- NFT -RRB- , and by the lack of a thalamic input .

9602087|l.d.loopuyt@uni-tuebingen.de In order to study differences in response to neocortical injury sustained at different ages at the neurotransmitter level , we examined the density in D2 dopamine receptors in the neostriatum of cats hemidecorticated neonatally -LRB- N = 4 -RRB- or in adulthood -LRB- N = 4 -RRB- , as well as in intact brains -LRB- N = 6 -RRB- .
9602087|Receptor densities were measured using quantitative autoradiography and -LSB- 3H -RSB- - spiperone binding in 12 regions of the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens septi .
9614247|Plasticity of synapses in the rat neostriatum after unilateral lesion of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway .
9614247|In the 6-hydroxydopamine model of Parkinson 's disease in the rat , there is a significant reduction in the number of dendritic spines on the principal projection neurons in the neostriatum , presumably attributable to loss of the nigrostriatal dopamine input .
9614247|Unbiased estimates of synaptic density and absolute numbers of synapses in a defined volume of the neostriatum were made using the `` disector '' and Cavalieri techniques .
9614247|Numerical synaptic density of asymmetric synaptic contacts was 17 % lower in the neostriatum deprived of dopamine innervation and , in absolute terms , there were 3 billion -LRB- 19 % -RRB- fewer contacts .
9622193|Lesioned animals with additional implants of embryonic nigral cell suspensions into the dopamine-denervated neostriatum showed a reduced -LRB- but not significant -RRB- deficit and did not differ from control performance .
9623985|Neuropathological , neurochemical and behavioral features of the disease can all be reproduced in experimental animals by local injection of excitotoxic or metabolic toxins into the neostriatum .
9623985|Here we demonstrate good survival , differentiation and integration of striatal allografts in the primate neostriatum , and recovery in a test of skilled motor performance .
9628414|Therefore , we decided to analyze whether unilateral ibotenic acid lesions aimed at this brain region would acutely lead to asymmetries in open-field behavior , and whether they would affect the biogenic amines dopamine and serotonin in the neostriatum , hippocampus , and tectum .
9628414|These lesions were investigated because all three brain areas are anatomically linked to the neostriatum , are related to the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin , and play a role in behavioral asymmetry and functional recovery .
9628414|In animals with unilateral ibotenic acid lesions of the tuberomammillary nucleus , several markers of dopaminergic and serotonergic activity were increased in the neostriatum , tectum , and hippocampus .
9666169|The present study focused on the co-expression of the low-affinity neurotrophin receptor p75NTR and calbindin in cholinergic neurons of the raccoon basal forebrain and neostriatum .
9666169|Carbocyanine immunofluorescence double labelling revealed the co-localization of choline acetyltransferase and p75NTR as well as calbindin in a large portion of basal forebrain neurons , but not in the neostriatum .
9668663|To examine the potential role of these protein kinase pathways in drug-induced damage to the CNS , we used the dopaminergic neurotoxicant , 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1 ,2,3,6 - tetrahydropyridine -LRB- MPTP -RRB- , and to damage nerve terminals in the mouse neostriatum and elicit a glial reaction .
9671283|In adults , all HVC injections produced an even , nontopographic distribution of retrograde label throughout the medial magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- mMAN -RRB- , the interfacial nucleus -LRB- NIf -RRB- , and the uvaeform nucleus of the thalamus -LRB- Uva -RRB- and an even distribution of anterograde label within area X of the striatum and the robust nucleus of the archistriatum -LRB- RA -RRB- .
9671283|Injections into pHVC indicate that this region receives afferent input from song control areas HVC , mMAN , medial regions of the parvicellular shell of lateral MAN , NIf , and Uva and projects to Area X , caudomedial regions of striatum , and regions of the caudomedial neostriatum -LRB- NCM -RRB- .
9671671|The `` neostriatum '' develops as part of the lateral pallium in birds .
9671671|Particularly contested is the avian `` neostriatum , '' which has historically been homologized to either mammalian striatum , lateral neocortex , or endopiriform claustrum .
9671671|The data show that a definite boundary to cellular migration develops just ventral to the neostriatum between 5 and 8 d of incubation .
9671671|Labeled polyclones within the neostriatum stretch from the ventricular zone to the brain surface and exhibit an increasingly rostrocaudal orientation as development proceeds .
9671671|Individual polyclones contribute cells to several of the distinct auditory , visual , somatosensory , and olfactory regions within the neostriatum .
9671671|A comparative analysis suggests that the avian neostriatum develops from a precursor region that in other vertebrates gives rise to olfactory cortex and , when present , to other components of the piriform lobe , such as the endopiriform claustrum and basolateral amygdala .
9675424|This study examined the effects of thalamo-striatal deafferentation on preprotachykinin and preproenkephalin mRNA expression in the rat neostriatum , using quantitative in situ hybridization histochemistry .
9676980|Tissue was removed , 9.5 hr or 24 hr after training , from the left and right IMHV , hyperstriatum accessorium , and posterior neostriatum .
9676980|There were no learning-related effects in either the hyperstriatum accessorium or the posterior neostriatum .
9682017|Serotonin axons of the neostriatum show a higher affinity for striatal than for ventral mesencephalic transplants : a quantitative study in adult and immature recipient rats .
9682017|It is concluded that the 5-HT axons innervating the neostriatum have a better affinity for striatal grafts than for ventral mesencephalic grafts or the nonstriatal portions of striatal grafts .

9704891|p75NGFR mediates death of cholinergic neurons during postnatal development of the neostriatum in mice .
9704891|Here , we investigated whether and when the cholinergic neurons of the neostriatum , which express TrkA and p75NGFR during early postnatal times , undergo p75NGFR-mediated death .
9704891|During this time , the neostriatum of control , but not p75NGFR-deficient , mice contained many apoptotic cells .
9704891|However , the roles of p75NGFR and TrkA appear to be more complicated in the neostriatum where relatively few neurons express p75NGFR during the death phase -LRB- and predominantly in the lateral neostriatum where the neuronal loss is greatest -RRB- , and TrkA-positive as well as TrkA-negative neurons may be lost .

9722150|The release of amino acids from rat neostriatum and substantia nigra in vivo : a dual microdialysis probe analysis .
9722150|It has previously been demonstrated , in dual probe microdialysis studies , that stimulation of the neostriatum with kainic acid causes the release of GABA both locally within the neostriatum and distally in the substantia nigra , observations that are consistent with the known anatomy of the basal ganglia .
9722150|The application of kainic acid to neostriatum enhanced the release of GABA , taurine , aspartate and glutamate locally in the neostriatum and distally in the substantia nigra .
9722150|The distal release of each amino acid in the substantia nigra was sensitive to the administration of 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2 ,3 - dione and tetrodotoxin to the neostriatum .
9722150|It is concluded that the release of taurine from the substantia nigra has similar characteristics to that of GABA and may be released from the terminals of striatonigral neurons following the stimulation of their cell bodies in the neostriatum .
9722150|The release of taurine in the neostriatum however , is likely to be mediated mainly by different mechanisms and not related to neuronal activity .
9722150|The release of excitatory amino acids is likely to involve indirect effects in the neostriatum and polysynaptic pathways in the substantia nigra .

9761455|Injection of QUIN into rat neostriatum induced a massive loss of striatal medium-sized spiny neurons , and led to a comparable loss of IP3-receptor and PAG immunoreactivity , suggesting a neuronal localisation of both these proteins .
9761455|Following this lesion , the neostriatum showed a negligible loss of DARPP-32 immunoreactivity -LRB- -11 + / -5 % -RRB- , but contained only 43 + / -3 % of IP3-receptor immunoreactivity levels compared to controls .
9761455|The decrease in the level of IP3-receptor immunoreactivity appears to be selective with respect to the other proteins studied , and the IP3-receptor thus shows extreme sensitivity to QUIN neurotoxicity in the neostriatum .

9763385|CONCLUSIONS : Bilateral age-related shrinkage of the neostriatum is found in healthy adults .
9766400|Significant immunoreactivity was observed in auditory nuclei , including the nucleus mesencephalicus lateralis pars dorsalis , the thalamic nucleus ovoidalis , field L , the shelf of the high vocal center -LRB- HVC -RRB- , and the cup of the nucleus robustus archistriatalis -LRB- RA -RRB- , as well as in song control nuclei , including the HVC , RA , the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum , and the dorsomedial nucleus -LRB- DM -RRB- of the intercollicular complex .
9772242|The other projection of HVc begins a pathway through the anterior forebrain , -LRB- area X -- > medial portion of the dorsolateral nucleus of the thalamus -LRB- DLM -RRB- -- > lateral portion of the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- L-MAN -RRB- -- > RA -RRB- that is crucial for song learning but , although active during singing , is not essential for adult song production .

9774524|pcolombo@jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu Individual differences in spatial memory among young and aged rats were assessed using memory tasks related to integrity of the hippocampus and the neostriatum .
9774524|ChAT activity in the ventromedial and dorsolateral neostriatum of aged rats was significantly reduced in comparisons with young rats whereas no difference was found in the hippocampus .
9774524|Aged rats with the most ChAT activity in the anterior ventromedial neostriatum performed best on the place-learning and reference memory tasks but also made the most perseverative errors on the working memory task .
9774524|In addition , young and aged rats with the most ChAT activity in the anterior dorsolateral neostriatum were those with the least accurate working memory .
9774524|Thus age-related memory impairment has components that can be segregated by measuring relationships between cholinergic integrity in subregions of the anterior neostriatum and memory tasks with different strategic requirements .
9797073|Also , higher labelling was found in nuclei raphe dorsalis and medialis , in ventral divisions of rostral neostriatum , caudal neostriatum , rostral globus pallidus , posteromedial amygdaloid nucleus , septum , olfactory tubercles , vertical limb of Broca 's diagonal band , periventricular , latero-ventral and medio-ventral thalamic nuclei , medial geniculate nucleus , anterior hypothalamus and entorhinal cortex .
9801382|A subpopulation of neurons in the globus pallidus projects to the neostriatum , which is the major recipient of afferent information to the basal ganglia .
9801382|In addition to innervating the subthalamic nucleus and output nuclei , 6 of 23 labeled pallidal neurons projected to the neostriatum .
9801382|Both the firing characteristics and the extent of the axonal arborization in the neostriatum were variable .
9801382|These data imply that during periods of cortical activation , individual pallidal neurons may influence the activity of GABAergic interneurons of the neostriatum -LRB- which are involved in feed-forward inhibition and synchronization of principle neuron activity -RRB- while simultaneously patterning neuronal activity in basal ganglia downstream of the neostriatum .
9804909|There is a limited critical period for dopamine 's effects on D1 receptor expression in the developing rat neostriatum .

9821549|The neostriatum caudolaterale -LRB- NCL -RRB- of birds is thought to be equivalent to the mammalian prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- due to its dense dopaminergic innervation , its associative structure , and its importance for cognitive tasks which are known to be affected in mammals with prefrontal lesions .
9821549|Using a multiple regression analysis in which structure-specific lesion extents are correlated with different postoperative behavioral measures , the specific contribution of the relevant structures were differentiated from the neighbouring areas CDL -LRB- area corticoidea dorsolateralis -RRB- and NC -LRB- neostriatum caudale -RRB- .
9821550|The lateral portion of the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -LRB- 1MAN -RRB- was lesioned bilaterally in adult males maintained on short days -LRB- 8 h of light -RRB- .

9826064|Increased levels of extracellular dopamine in neostriatum and nucleus accumbens after histamine H1 receptor blockade .
9826064|The dopaminergic system plays a central role in the processing of reward or reinforcement since drugs that have reinforcing properties all share the ability to elevate dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- levels in the nucleus accumbens or neostriatum .
9826064|Here , we examined the effect of systemic -LRB- i.p. -RRB- treatment with two H1 antagonists , chlorpheniramine and pyrilamine , on the extracellular levels of DA and its metabolites dihydroxyphenylacetic acid -LRB- DOPAC -RRB- and homovanillic acid -LRB- HVA -RRB- in the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens of urethane-anesthetized rats .
9826064|Saline injections did not produce significant effects on DA , DOPAC , or HVA levels in the neostriatum or nucleus accumbens .
9826064|In the neostriatum , chlorpheniramine administration -LRB- 5 and 20 mg/kg -RRB- produced a sustained increase in DA to approximately 140 and 180 % of pre-injection baseline levels , respectively .
9826064|In both the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens , DOPAC and HVA decreased after chlorpheniramine treatment .
9826064|These results show that H1 antagonists can potently enhance DA levels in the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens of urethane-anesthetized rats .
9829821|Skein-like inclusions in the neostriatum from a case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with dementia .

9845912|-LSB- Functional specificity of the mediator systems as the basis for neostriatum polyfunctional properties -RSB- .
9845912|Following intrastriatal administration of dopamine - , GABA - , and encephalinergic drugs , the changes occurring in the rat behaviour were associated with a concrete transmitter system 's activity and neostriatum polyfunctionality -LRB- and not an unspecific nature -RRB- .
9853585|In the main experiment , rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the nigrostriatal bundle received dopamine-rich embryonic nigral grafts injected into the deafferented neostriatum via previously implanted guide cannulae , which allowed comparison to be made of graft survival after transplantation into awake and in re-anaesthetised animals .
9858265|We therefore examined intrinsic and synaptic properties of neurons in the cortical nucleus IMAN -LRB- lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum -RRB- , which forms part of this developmentally regulated circuit , in an in vitro preparation of the zebra finch forebrain .
9858756|In a study of the consequences of dopamine loss , rats were depleted of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and neostriatum by up to 99 % using 6-hydroxydopamine .
9862033|The lateral part of the hyperstriatum ventrale sent a few efferent fibres toward the diencephalon and brainstem , but projected massively to the ectostriatum periphericum , neostriatum intermedium pars laterale , the ventral part of the neostriatum caudale and the archistriatum dorsale .
9862033|The neostriatum may be an associative visual center and possibly a modulatory area toward the archistriatum intermedium dorsale , by which visual information may mediate , modulate and control the movements .
986305|After 6-OHDA , dopamine concentrations in the ipsilateral neostriatum were reduced to levels below the sensitivity of the fluorometric assay ; cortical , brainstem and neostriatal serotonin levels , on the other hand , were not altered after 6-OHDA .
986306|After various drug pretreatments , the contralaeral circling behavior precipitated by naloxone was : -LRB- a -RRB- reversed to ipsilateral circling by i.p. apomorphine or d-amphetamine , -LRB- b -RRB- unaltered by i.p. haloperidol or intraneostriatal arecoline administered into the intact neostriatum , and -LRB- c -RRB- reversed to ipsilateral circling by the administration of atropine into the intact neostriatum .
986306|These data suggest that a diminution of dopaminergic or an enhancement of cholinergic activities , or both , occur at the level of the neostriatum during naloxone-precipitated withdrawal in morphine-dependent rats .
9868965|Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated mild atrophy of the pons and cerebellum , and hyperintensity of the transverse pontine fibers and neostriatum on spin-echo images .
9871442|Role of excitatory amino acids in the regulation of dopamine synthesis and release in the neostriatum .
9871442|We have explored the role of excitatory amino acids in the increased dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- release that occurs in the neostriatum during stress-induced behavioral activation .
9871461|Release of endogenous excitatory amino acids in the neostriatum of the rat under physiological and pharmacologically-induced conditions .
9871461|We have investigated whether Glu and Asp release in the neostriatum can be selectively modulated by different neuronal systems .
9871461|Thus , these results demonstrate that extracellular levels of Glu and Asp are modulated differentially by different neuronal systems , and suggest that in the neostriatum of the rat there are neuronal populations using Glu and/or Asp as messenger -LRB- s -RRB- .
9873231|In an additional experiment , -LSB- 3H -RSB- raclopride binding was unchanged after single as well as 3 weeks of desipramine or citalopram treatment in the rat brain neostriatum .
9875351|Subcellular and subsynaptic distribution of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor in the neostriatum and globus pallidus of the rat : co-localization at synapses with the GluR2/3 subunit of the AMPA receptor .
9875351|Glutamatergic neurotransmission in the neostriatum and the globus pallidus is mediated through NMDA-type as well as other glutamate receptors and is critical in the expression of basal ganglia function .
9875351|In order to characterize the cellular , subcellular and subsynaptic localization of NMDA receptors in the neostriatum and globus pallidus , multiple immunocytochemical techniques were applied using antibodies that recognize the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor .
9875351|In the neostriatum all neurons with characteristics of spiny projection neurons , some interneurons and many dendrites and spines were immunoreactive for NR1 .
9875351|Double immunolabelling revealed that in neostriatum , over 80 % of NR1-positive axospinous synapses are also positive for GluR2/3 .
9875351|These results , together with previous data , suggest that NMDA and AMPA receptor subunits are expressed by the same neurons in the neostriatum and globus pallidus and that NMDA and AMPA receptors are , at least in part , colocalized at individual asymmetrical synapses .
