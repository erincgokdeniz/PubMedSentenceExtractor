11568425|Evidence for a differential involvement of the human left and right amygdala in emotional and cognitive behaviour is reviewed , with a particular emphasis on functional imaging results and case reports on patients with amygdalar damage .
11568425|The available evidence allows one to conclude that there is definitely a hemisphere specific processing difference between the left and right amygdala .
11568425|In spite of this , the following tentative proposals are made : the left amygdala is more closely related to affective information encoding with a higher affinity to language and to detailed feature extraction , and the right amygdala to affective information retrieval with a higher affinity to pictorial or image-related material .
11568425|Furthermore , the right amygdala may be more strongly engaged than the left one in a fast , shallow or gross analysis of affect-related information .

11773432|tony-buchanan@uiowa.edu The amygdala is involved in the normal facilitation of memory by emotion , but the separate contributions of the left and right amygdala to memory for verbal or nonverbal emotional material have not been investigated .
11773432|The group with right amygdala damage showed the normal pattern of facilitation of memory by emotion for both verbal and nonverbal stimuli despite an overall reduction in memory performance .
11784442|These results may suggest that the left and right amygdalae play a differential role in effective processing of facial expressions in collaboration with other cortical or subcortical regions , with the left being related with the bilateral prefrontal cortex , and the right with the right temporal lobe .
11816318|Left amygdala NAA-Cr and right amygdala Cho-Cr and NAA-Cr did not differ significantly between subjects with depression and control subjects .

12165365|In this MR study we used a 3D shape representation technique , based on spherical harmonic functions , to analyze left and right amygdala-hippocampus shapes in each of 15 patients with schizophrenia and 15 healthy controls matched for age , gender , handedness and parental socioeconomic status .
12165365|Left/right amygdala-hippocampal asymmetry , however , was significantly larger in patients than controls for both relative volume and shape .
12165379|Positive face discrimination activated the bilateral amygdalae of both controls and schizophrenics , with more prominent activation of the right amygdala shown in the schizophrenic group .
12165379|Negative face discrimination activated the bilateral amygdalae in the schizophrenic group whereas the right amygdala alone in the control group , although no significant group difference was found .

12244085|Emotional comprehension was correlated with atrophy in the right amygdala and the right OFC , and not with atrophy in other structures .
12244085|When individual profiles of amygdala atrophy were examined across patients and compared with control values , right amygdala atrophy was always accompanied by left amygdala atrophy , whereas patients with volume loss in the left amygdala could have normal or decreased right amygdala volumes .
12377162|This identified gray matter decreases in the schizophrenics , at the corrected voxel level -LRB- P < 0.05 -RRB- , in the left and right uncus and parahippocampal gyri and the right amygdala .
12482078|Responses in right amygdala , superior colliculus , and pulvinar exhibited significant time x condition interactions with respect to faces with fearful eyes -LRB- FF , FN -RRB- vs neutral eyes -LRB- NF , NN -RRB- .
12482682|Additionally , they provide support for the hypothesis that , in this paradigm , emotional arousal enhances long-term memory for central information in men via activation of right amygdala/hemisphere function , and enhances long-term memory for peripheral details in women via activation of left amygdala/hemisphere function .

12507690|Habituation of blood-oxygenation-level-dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- signal during exposure to face stimuli , collapsed over fearful and neutral expressions , was evident in the right amygdala and hippocampus , as well as in the medial/inferior temporal cortex bilaterally .
12544830|Whereas the expectancy of pleasant stimuli produced activation in the left dorsolateral and left medial prefrontal cortex as well as in the right cerebellum , the expectancy of unpleasant stimuli produced activation in the right inferior and right medial prefrontal cortex , the right amygdala , the left anterior cingulate cortex , and bilaterally in the visual cortex .
12595192|Gradient compensation increased effective T -LRB- 2 -RRB- * values in left and right amygdala on average by 18.8 + / - 7.5 ms , while maintaining sensitivity in uncompensated brain areas .
12611834|Elevated activity in the right caudate may be a marker of responsiveness to antiobsessional treatment , while lower right amygdala activity and higher midline prefrontal activity may be required for response of depressive symptoms to treatment .
12705502|For the sample as a whole , amygdala volume correlated positively with age , and larger volumes of both the left and right amygdala were significantly associated with better performance on several cognitive tasks assessing academic skills and acquired knowledge in long-term memory .
12738003|Audition of laughing and crying leads to right amygdala activation in a low-noise fMRI setting .

12784931|In condition eliciting negative emotions we also detected activation of occipito-temporal regions and additionally activation of bilateral anterior insulae , right amygdala and right superior temporal gyrus .
12804127|Increased left and right amygdala : hippocampal volume ratios were associated with increased severity of anxiety but not increased severity of depression or duration of illness .
12815023|Fischer-344 rats received cholesterol -LRB- inactive control -RRB- - , corticosterone - , or aldosterone-containing micropellets placed stereotaxically on the dorsal margin of the left and right amygdala -LRB- n = 10 for each group -RRB- .
12821105|This illustrates that the right amygdala can influence retention of complex emotional stimuli with verbal and pictorial arousing properties .
12845380|In addition , there was a trend -LRB- P values between 0.05 and 0.10 -RRB- to smaller volumes of the right temporal lobe -LRB- 7 % , t21 = 1.99 , P = 0.06 -RRB- , right amygdala -LRB- 8 % , t21 = 1.83 , P = 0.08 -RRB- , left amygdala -LRB- 5 % , t21 = 1.78 , P = 0.09 -RRB- and left hippocampus -LRB- 9 % , t21 = 1.93 , P = 0.07 -RRB- in panic patients compared to controls .
12873851|A discriminant function analysis demonstrated that the degree of atrophy of right posterior cingulate , left parietal lobe , right amygdala , and right anterior temporal lobe structures correctly classified 96 % of the patients .
1449382|Moreover , the right white matter volume in schizophrenic patients was significantly related to right amygdala/hippocampal volume -LRB- r = .39 -RRB- , data that provide preliminary support for a hypothesis of abnormal limbic-cortical connection in schizophrenia .
14527602|When attention was unconstrained , adolescents relative to adults showed greater activation in the anterior cingulate , bilateral orbitofrontal cortex , and right amygdala in response to the fearful relative to neutral faces .
14531157|Effects of left amygdala lesions on respiration , skin conductance , heart rate , anxiety , and activity of the right amygdala during anticipation of negative stimulus .
14531157|The present study reports the effects of lesions in the left amygdala on anxiety , respiration , skin conductance , heart rate , and electrical potentials in the right amygdala in two patients .
14531157|Lesions in the left amygdala resulted in decreases of trait and state anxiety , respiratory rate , and activity in the right amygdala in both patients ; one patient also showed notable decreases in skin conductance and heart rate .
14531157|The study also reports that activities in the right amygdala before the lesion were not observed after the lesion .
14531157|We suggest that the activity of the right amygdala is dominantly activated in anxiety and anxiety-related physiological responses but needs excitatory inputs from the left amygdala .
14597304|The additional presence of left amygdala sclerosis resulted in reorganisation for encoding of emotional verbal material to right amygdala .
14614086|There were two key findings : -LRB- 1 -RRB- impaired overall SCR after right amygdala damage ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- impaired correlation of SCR with the rated arousal of the stimuli after left amygdala damage .
14614086|Our results provide support for the hypothesis that the left and right amygdalae subserve different functions in emotion processing : the left may decode the arousal signaled by the specific stimulus , whereas the right may provide a global level of autonomic activation triggered automatically by any arousing stimulus .
14642483|The bilateral posterior cingulate cortices showed significant increases in activity as the experimental sessions proceeded , while the activation in the right amygdala and the left medial fusiform gyrus decreased .
14683713|Enhanced activity in the right amygdala was related to enhanced memory for the emotional films .
14683713|To identify potential candidate voxels for SEqM , the functional connectivity of the maximally activated voxel within the right amygdala was investigated using partial least squares .
14741673|Activity in the right amygdala was greater with subliminal presentation of the angry prime compared with subliminal presentation of a neutral face or white-blank stimuli .
14741673|Most importantly , the degree of activation of the right amygdala was negatively correlated with that of the right ventral PFC only with the anger prime .
14757593|However , for both subgroups with PTSD , rCBF changes in medial frontal gyrus were inversely correlated with rCBF changes in the left amygdala and the right amygdala/periamygdaloid cortex .
14757593|Furthermore , in the traumatic condition , for both subgroups with PTSD , symptom severity was positively related to rCBF in the right amygdala and negatively related to rCBF in medial frontal gyrus .
14979779|Amygdalar lateralization in fear conditioning : evidence for greater involvement of the right amygdala .
14979779|The relative contribution of left and right amygdalae in the acquisition and retention of fear conditioning was investigated in rats .
14979779|Pretraining bilateral electrolytic lesions blocked the acquisition of conditioned fear to tone and context , whereas unilateral lesions induced partial impairments with no left-right amygdala differences .
14979779|Although no left-right difference was observed to tone , the right amygdala lesions generated greater deficits in contextual fear than the left amygdala lesions .
14979779|These results indicate that fear conditioning is partially disrupted with unilateral amygdalar lesions , but that the right amygdala has greater involvement than the left amygdala when conditioning occurs under a normal brain state .
15004563|Sex differences were specific to the sexual nature of the stimuli , were restricted primarily to limbic regions , and were larger in the left amygdala than the right amygdala .
15027419|Those who reported increased fear showed right amygdala activation during the threat condition and left amygdala activation in the safe condition .
15030492|METHODS : Under pentobarbital anesthesia , mice were fixed to a stereotaxic apparatus , and bipolar electrodes were implanted into the right amygdala .
15095176|In particular , volumes of the right amygdala-hippocampus complex were correlated with declarative memory performance in the non-verbal visual domain .
15135882|In particular , volumes of the right amygdala-hippocampus complex correlated with declarative memory performance , whereas volumes of the left temporo-parietal regions correlated with performance in naming and praxia .
15144423|METHODS : A right sensorimotor cortex freeze lesion was induced in postnatal day 1 -LRB- P1 -RRB- rat pups , and HSs were provoked at P10 under continuous monitoring of core temperature ; EEGs were recorded from the right amygdala during and after hyperthermia .
15145620|Most of these studies observed lateralized amygdala activity , indicative of a clear hemisphere-specific processing difference between the left and right amygdalae .
15145620|Because individual studies use varying paradigms and are limited by statistical power and sensitivity , it has remained unclear whether the left or the right amygdala is more consistently involved in emotional processing .
15145620|Our findings indicate that across studies , the left amygdala is more often activated than the right amygdala , suggesting different roles for the left and right amygdalae in emotional processing .
15145620|Further analysis showed that this predominant left amygdala activation is not significantly related to stimulus type , task instructions , differential habituation rates of the left and right amygdalae or elaborate processing .
15158011|Individuals with one or two copies of the short allele exhibited significantly increased levels of anxiety-related traits , state anxiety , and enhanced right amygdala responding to anxiety provocation , compared with subjects homozygous for the long allele .
15178947|Based on previous research , we hypothesized that agreeableness would be negatively correlated with left medial orbitofrontal cortex size and positively correlated with right amygdala volume .
15178947|This finding partly replicates a previous study that used a different measure of social functioning , the Interpersonal Adjective Scale , to delineate a left frontal-right amygdala circuit for agreeableness .
15219596|Despite an equal behavioral result to controls , the patients showed less activation in the components of the circuit -LRB- right amygdala , bilateral hippocampal region , medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- MPFC -RRB- , basal ganglia , thalamus , cerebellum , midbrain , and visual cortex -RRB- .
15219596|In particular , decreased activation in the right amygdala and MPFC appears to be an important finding related to dysfunctional emotional behavior in schizophrenia .
15246114|Male Wistar rats were stereotactically implanted in the right amygdala with a bipolar electrode .
15276825|bhettrs@umdnj.edu The present study sought to determine the effects of kindled seizures generated from the left and right amygdala upon weight gain in rat .
15276825|The results demonstrated that kindling from either the left or right amygdala induced significant increases in weight gain relative to the control rats .
15276825|Likewise , serum leptin levels , which were highly correlated with weight gain , also showed significantly greater increases in left amygdaloid kindled rats relative to rats kindled from the right amygdala and control rats .
15319804|In amygdaloid kindled seizures , electrodes were implanted into the right amygdala and electroencephalogram was recorded bipolarly ; stimulation was applied bipolarly every day by a constant current stimulator and continued until a generalized convulsion was obtained .
15327714|Results revealed that both the hippocampus and the amygdala are reliably asymmetrical structures in normal adults , with larger right hippocampal -LRB- D = 0.21 , p. 001 -RRB- and right amygdala -LRB- D = 0.09 , p. 01 -RRB- volumes .
15336519|The challenge condition was associated with activation in both right superior temporal sulcus and right amygdala , which might relate to increased social vigilance and anxiety , respectively .
15364037|Bipolar patients did not show significant differences in right or left hippocampus , temporal lobe gray matter , temporal lobe , or right amygdala volumes -LRB- analysis of covariance , age , gender , and ICV as covariates , p > .05 -RRB- compared with healthy control subjects .
15474920|Volume of the right amygdala in subjects with schizophrenia and in controls was significantly related to emotional learning , indicating better learning in subjects with larger amygdala size .
15474920|It seems to be linked to size reduction of the right amygdala in schizophrenia .
1547750|We also found that on a right amygdala that had been influenced by a left dentate lesion there were few spikes , while on the left amygdala there were frequent spikes .
15488397|In addition to the areas identified by the analysis of the average MEG data , statistically significant activity is identified in several other areas , including a sustained increase in the right amygdala activity in response to emotional faces in schizophrenic subjects .
15505973|Voxel-based morphometry -LRB- VBM -RRB- showed most significant atrophy in the right amygdala/anterior hippocampal complex and collateral sulcus , extending to the right insula .
15546702|Considering gender differences , male patients had significantly smaller volumes in the bilateral amygdala than male controls ; female patients had a significantly reduced right amygdala compared with female controls .

15664794|Sensitization effects were observed in the right amygdala in the OCD group ; these paralleled an increase in levels of distress and obsessionality as well as a decrease in dorsolateral prefrontal activity .
15673663|COMT genotype had no significant impact on brain activation by pleasant stimuli but was related to the neural response to unpleasant stimuli : reactivity to unpleasant stimuli was significantly positively correlated with the number of met158 alleles in the limbic system -LRB- left hippocampus , right amygdala , right thalamus -RRB- , connected prefrontal areas -LRB- bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex , right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -RRB- , and the visuospatial attention system -LRB- bilateral fusiform gyrus , left inferior parietal lobule -RRB- .
15718370|Response patterns differed early in the right amygdala , paralleling initial respiratory pattern deficits , and late in the right insula , concomitant with cardiac rate differences .
15724143|Before L-T -LRB- 4 -RRB- treatment , the patients exhibited significantly higher activity in the right subgenual cingulate cortex , left thalamus , medial temporal lobe -LRB- right amygdala , right hippocampus -RRB- , right ventral striatum , and cerebellar vermis ; and had lower relative activity in the middle frontal gyri bilaterally .
15724143|L-T -LRB- 4 -RRB- improved mood -LRB- remission in seven patients ; partial response in three -RRB- ; and decreased relative activity in the right subgenual cingulate cortex , left thalamus , right amygdala , right hippocampus , right dorsal and ventral striatum , and cerebellar vermis .
15741749|Disgust sensitivity and trait anxiety were positively , and independently from each other , correlated with the activation of the right amygdala .
15753240|Finally , relative to the control group , the PTSD group tended to exhibit diminished habituation of fearful vs happy responses in the right amygdala across functional runs , although this effect did not exceed our a priori statistical threshold .
15823161|In those five subjects , the rCBF in the right amygdala and the left posterior cingulate gyrus after acquisition of fear conditioning significantly increased relative to the rCBF before conditioning .
15827569|The right amygdala response to aversive faces was attenuated by citalopram .
15828421|When a rabbit saw a dog , the number of common inputs to neurons increased and the leading role of the right amygdalar neurons grew -LRB- 57 % -RRB- due to an increase in inhibitory influences from the right to the left amygdala .
15851723|Relative to all other participants , hypertensive subjects that performed relatively well on verbal memory showed an enhanced rCBF response in the right amygdala/hippocampus .
15862214|Psychophysiological interactions revealed an inverse functional connectivity between occipito-temporal visual regions and the left amygdala , but a positive connectivity between these visual region and the right amygdala , suggesting that there is a hemispheric specialization in the transfer of fear signals from sensory cortices to amygdala .
15862523|We administered agents like NPY , alpha-MSH , selective melanocortin-4 receptor -LRB- MC4-R -RRB- antagonist HS014 and NPY Y1 receptor agonist -LSB- Leu -LRB- 31 -RRB- , Pro -LRB- 34 -RRB- -RSB- - NPY , alone and in combinations , unilaterally in right amygdala of rats and measured the response using elevated plus maze test .
15869492|However , there also was a recapitulation of emotional study context in the right amygdala during familiarity only , which might therefore be related to affective implicit memory .
15885507|Relative to healthy participants , patients with schizophrenia were characterised by underactivity during novel stimulus processing in the right amygdala-hippocampus , within paralimbic cortex in the rostral anterior cingulate and posterior cingulate cortices and the right frontal operculum , and in association cortex at the right temporo-parietal-occipital junction , bilateral intraparietal sulcus , and bilateral dorsal frontal cortex .
15908839|Subjects with BD had smaller volumes in the left and right amygdala , driven by reductions in gray matter volume .
15947057|A double-dissociation between the functions of left and right amygdala is implied by lesion studies but supportive evidence is inconsistent , partly because patients with structural anteromedial temporal anomalies have experienced variable surgical procedures .
15947057|Arousal to -LRB- fearful-neutral -RRB- faces was associated with transiently increased skin conductance responses and bilateral amygdala activation in both groups , but X-monosomic females had proportionately greater -- and more persistent -- right amygdala activation than controls .
15961229|Analysis of group , condition , and hemisphere revealed a significant three-way interaction , with right greater than left habituation in the young , but left greater than right amygdala habituation in the elderly .
15993537|The fMRI data analysis of the angry versus neutral faces contrast demonstrated greater activation in younger versus older individuals in the right amygdala/hippocampus region , whereas older adults demonstrated greater activation in the right anterior-ventral insula cortex .
15993624|Critically , a valence effect was observed in the right amygdala during low attentional demand conditions , but not during medium or high demand conditions .
16000636|The genotype effect in the right amygdala and prefrontal cortex was largest during the first run of the experiment .
16012281|Treatment response was associated with significant BOLD changes : increases in prefrontal cortex activation particularly in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- DLPFC , BA 46 -RRB- and the right anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC , BA 32 -RRB- ; and in the left putamen , right anterior temporal pole -LRB- ATP -RRB- , and right amygdala .
16055351|Whereas the right amygdala and bilateral superior temporal sulcus responded to anger prosody irrespective of whether it was heard from a to-be-attended or to-be-ignored voice , the orbitofrontal cortex and the cuneus in medial occipital cortex showed greater activation to the same emotional stimuli when the angry voice was to-be-attended rather than to-be-ignored .
16061770|In PD , color naming panic-related words was slowed and correlated with increased activation of the right amygdala and hippocampus .

16139812|While the amygdala , especially the right amygdala , seems to be crucially involved in automatic stimuli processing , activation of areas such as the insula , ACC and DMPFC is rather associated with direct threat evaluation and requires sufficient attentional resources .
16143545|The left and right amygdalae responded to both the emotion and the identity matching condition , and the only selective response to emotion matching was at the left inferior prefrontal sulcus .
16197694|Damage to either the left or right amygdala was associated with impairment in the recognition of both social and cognitive expressions , despite an intact ability to extract information relating to invariant physical attributes .
16204201|In contrast , when contextual retrieval was unsuccessful , items encoded in emotional contexts elicited enhanced activity in right amygdala and a right-lateralized network that included extrastriate visual areas .
16216534|PTSD subjects also showed a small but significant enhancement in left amygdala activity , most apparent during the Late phase , but reduction in Early right amygdala response .
16255007|Compared to a passive resting condition -LRB- without penile erection -RRB- , sexual stimulation of the penis increased rCBF in an area of the right hemisphere encompassing the posterior insula and adjacent posterior part of the secondary somatosensory cortex -LRB- SII -RRB- and decreased rCBF in the right amygdala .
16272876|Extraversion was positively correlated with gray matter concentration in the left amygdala , whereas neuroticism was negatively correlated with gray matter concentration in the right amygdala .
16281289|Time series analysis showed a trend toward greater right amygdala responses to subliminal fear , but left-sided responses to supraliminal fear .
16326115|The right amygdala was associated with greater functional connectivity in men than in women .
16326115|Furthermore , the regions displaying stronger functional connectivity with the right amygdala in males -LRB- sensorimotor cortex , striatum , pulvinar -RRB- differed from those displaying stronger functional connectivity with the left amygdala in females -LRB- subgenual cortex , hypothalamus -RRB- .
16340378|The statistical comparison between the 2 situations -LRB- emotional vs control condition -RRB- revealed a highly significant reduction in activation of the bilateral amygdala for the levodopa fMRI session -LRB- P corrected < 0.0001 in the left and P = 0.002 in the right amygdala -RRB- .
16377154|RESULTS : Relative to control subjects , the patients demonstrated -LRB- 1 -RRB- significantly greater activation of the left hippocampus while viewing all three facial expressions and -LRB- 2 -RRB- increased right amygdala activation during the initial presentation of fearful and neutral facial expressions .
16418007|At the neural level , implicit moral attitude , as indexed by increased BOLD response as a function of stimulus intensity , was associated with increased activation in the right amygdala and the ventromedial orbitofrontal cortex .
16427743|The ipsilateral or contralateral central piriform cortex received low-frequency stimulation -LRB- 15 min train of 0.1 ms pulses at 1 Hz and 50-150 muA -RRB- immediately after termination of once daily kindling stimulation -LRB- 2 s train of 1 ms pulses at 60 Hz and 150-300 microA -RRB- in the right amygdala for 30 days .
16465484|In hunger , many cases -LRB- 52 % -RRB- showed pairs in which the first neuron to discharge was in the left amygdala , this being followed by a neuron in the right amygdala -LRB- peaks from 10-50 and 130-150 msec -RRB- .
16465484|On presentation of dogs , there was an increase in the number of cases showing a common input to neurons , along with an increase in the leading role of neurons in the right amygdala -LRB- 57 % -RRB- , due to increases in inhibitory influences from this area on cells in the left amygdala .
16510224|Activation of the left and right amygdala in response to the masked fearful faces -LRB- compared to neutral faces -RRB- was significantly correlated with the number of fearful faces detected .
16521485|MRI revealed a discrete lesion in the right amygdala/uncus region .
16525417|Both tasks were associated with relative decreases in activity in the right amygdala and the hippocampus .
16528524|RESULTS : SPM analysis of pre - and post-lamotrigine brain SPECT images showed decreased perfusion in bilateral dorsomedial nuclei of thalami , bilateral uncus , right amygdala , left subcallosal gyrus , right superior and inferior frontal gyri , right precentral gyrus , bilateral superior and inferior temporal gyri and brainstem -LRB- pons , medulla -RRB- after lamotrigine medication at a false discovery rate-corrected p < 0.05 .

16585468|The 5-HT -LRB- 1A -RRB- receptor BP was inversely associated with heart rate in the raphe , left cingulate , and right amygdala .
16597782|The findings show that individuals with Williams syndrome tend to be more engaged in musical activities than others , and I report a possible neuroanatomical correlate of this engagement , with increased activation in the right amygdala to music and to noise .
16648880|Moreover , social , but not mechanical , interpretations elicited activity in regions implicated in the perception and modulation of emotion -LRB- right amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex -RRB- .
16670653|RESULTS : After covarying for whole brain volume , children with VCFS exhibited 11 % greater volume of the left amygdala -LRB- p = .002 -RRB- and 8 % greater volume of the right amygdala -LRB- p = .01 -RRB- .
16682795|In cases homozygous for the epsilon4 allele -LRB- n = 8 -RRB- versus noncarriers , the greatest atrophy was located in the right amygdala followed by the right parahippocampal gyrus , the left amygdala and the left medial dorsal thalamic nucleus .
16708026|Furthermore , there was greater activation in the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex , right anterior temporal pole , right amygdala , and right insula in depressed individuals .
16754842|RESULTS : Larger right amygdalar volume was associated with more severe social and communication impairments at ages 3 and 4 years .
16754842|Larger right amygdalar volume also was predictive of poorer social and communication abilities at age 6 years , even after controlling for IQ and total cerebral volume .
16754842|CONCLUSIONS : Larger right amygdalar volume at 3 and 4 years of age , but not left amygdalar , hippocampal , or total cerebral volume , is associated with a more severe clinical course and worse outcome at age 6 years in children with autism spectrum disorder .
16759342|In smoking versus baseline contrasts , additional areas of greater activation were found in AA , including the right amygdala and left caudate nucleus .
16769955|During cataplexy , subtracted SPECT showed hyperperfusion in right amygdala , bilateral cingulate gyri , basal ganglia , thalami , premotor cortices , sensorimotor cortices , right insula , and brainstem , and hypoperfusion in prefrontal cortex and occipital lobe .
16784731|A bipolar electrode was chronically implanted in the right amygdala of male Wistar rats .
1680359|Under halothane anesthesia , Microdialysis probe was inserted to the kindled focus , the right amygdala , and glutamate and aspartate contents of extracellular fluid were measured from 15 minutes prior to 30 minutes after seizure by high performance liquid chromatography -LRB- HPLC -RRB- .
16806312|The control group also showed varying responses in social brain areas to varying intensities of fearful expression , including differential activations in the left and right amygdala .
16828125|Consistent with our hypothesis , right amygdala showed a predicted non-linear response profile with greater responses to highly attractive and unattractive faces compared to middle-ranked faces , independent of task .
16857388|In 5 brains , repeat segmentation resulted in intraclass correlation coefficients > 0.9 -LRB- except for the right amygdala -RRB- and an average percent voxel overlap of 90.0 % .
16859412|Whereas a region within the right hippocampus responded strongly to all faces that had been paired with a description , regardless of its valence , activity in the right amygdala was uniquely sensitive to faces that had been previously associated with emotional descriptions -LRB- negative and positive > neutral -RRB- .
16859420|Critically , a direct comparison between both stages revealed that whereas the right amygdala was involved in emotional memory formation , the retrieval of those memories relied on the left amygdala .
16864952|We first determined at the right amygdala afterdischarge threshold -LRB- ADT -RRB- that is the minimal electric current necessary to evoke afterdischarge .
16864952|For investigating the effects of dantrolene on the development of kindling , rats were stimulated once daily at the right amygdala with a current , 10 % larger than ADT , one hour after either dantrolene or vehicle had been injected intraperitoneally .
16880223|According to responses on Izard scales , electrical stimulations of the right amygdala induced negative emotions , especially fear and sadness .
1691672|Intra-VTA administration of DiMe-C7 increased levels of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid -LRB- DOPAC -RRB- in the nucleus accumbens , olfactory tubercules and right amygdala , indicating increased mesolimbic dopamine metabolism .
1691672|DiMe-C7 also increased 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid -LRB- 5-HIAA -RRB- levels in the amygdala but this was only statistically significant in the right amygdala .
16922878|Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy -LRB- TLE -RRB- associated with mesial temporal sclerosis -LRB- MTS -RRB- often incur right amygdalar damage , resulting in impaired FER if TLE onset occurred before age 6 years .
16922878|These results indicate that proper development of the right amygdala is necessary for optimal fear recognition , with other neural processes unable to compensate for early amygdalar damage .
16942757|Women have a higher concentration in the orbitofrontal cortex involving Brodmann 's areas 10 , 11 and 25 and temporomedial cortex -LRB- bilateral hippocampus and right amygdala -RRB- , as well as their left basal insular cortex .
16950220|RESULTS : The uptake of the labeled NK1 receptor antagonist was significantly reduced in the right amygdala during phobic stimulation .

16963565|We found that previously reported sex differences of memory associations with left amygdala for women and with right amygdala for men were confined to the ventral amygdala during picture viewing and delayed memory .
16996281|A brain MRI revealed a high signal in the right amygdala , hippocampus and thalamus , instead of the pons .
17019406|A stronger mood lowering effect was associated with less accurate performance on faces expressing a negative emotion in the incidental task and a stronger right amygdala response to fearful faces in comparison to happy faces .
17030660|On average , the left amygdala was 39 % smaller in semantic dementia than in frontal variant FTLD , whereas the right amygdala was only 1 % smaller .
17058525|The mean right amygdalar volume of our patients was significantly smaller than the left one -LRB- p = 0.031 -RRB- , with the right-to-left volume ratio of 0.96 + / - 0.06 .
17058525|This tendency towards smaller right amygdala may be an acquired effect as a result of stress-induced plasticity , however we can not exclude the possibility of a predisposing condition .
17065334|Insulin was associated with increased metabolism in ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex and with decreased metabolism in right amygdala/hippocampus and cerebellar vermis -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- , relative to global brain .

17280513|Results indicated that faster judgments of negative relative to neutral information were associated with increased left and right amygdala activation .
17313824|METHODS : Thirty-two SD rats were randomly divided into sham operation group -LRB- n = 12 , receiving the implantation of bipolar electrode into the right amygdala only -RRB- , and kindling model group which was re-divided into 2 subgroups : low grade seizure subgroup -LRB- n = 8 , undergoing stimulation 40 times a day for 7 days so as to induce seizure of stage 1 approximately 3 according to Racine grading -RRB- and high grade seizure subgroup -LRB- n = 2 , undergoing stimulation 40 times a day for 7 days so as to induce seizure of stage 4 approximately 5 -RRB- The rats were killed in 7 days and their bilateral amygdala were taken out .
17313824|No significant differences were found in the mRNA and protein expression of Kv 4.2 , Kv4 .3 , and KChIP1 between left and right amygdala in any groups .

17548755|We observed reduced gray matter in the right amygdala , hypothalamus -LRB- bilaterally -RRB- , septal regions , substantia innominata , and bed nucleus of the striae terminalis .
17548755|Smaller right amygdalar volumes were correlated with the propensity to commit uniform pedophilic sexual offenses exclusively -LRB- P = .006 -RRB- but not with age -LRB- P = .89 -RRB- .
17548755|Subtle defects of the right amygdala and closely related structures might be implicated in the pathogenesis of pedophilia and might possibly reflect developmental disturbances or environmental insults at critical periods .
17566766|As anxiety level increased across participants , right and left auditory cortical as well as right amygdala activity increased to stimulus deviance .
17568631|Alternatively the results may represent an improvement in function of the right amygdala following the excision of a noxious inhibitory epileptogenic focus on the left .
17568631|The finding complements earlier demonstrations that damage to the right amygdala is associated with impaired processing of fear ; amelioration of right amygdala function may conversely be associated with an improvement .

17595018|Compared with HC subjects , SAD patients exhibited exaggerated responses in the right amygdala for the Angry versus Neutral contrast .
17601709|This was due to the BPD group exhibiting a significantly larger magnitude of deactivation -LRB- relative to HC -RRB- in the bilateral rostral/subgenual anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- to fear and in the left ACC to fear minus neutral ; and significantly greater activation in the right amygdala to fear minus neutral .

17634566|Further , strong negative associations were found between areas of prefrontal cortex and right amygdala responses in participants high in mindfulness but not in participants low in mindfulness .
17650397|The subtraction of the results of emotion Stroop task and general word task showed the brain function area activation images as follows simple emotion factors activated the right amygdala , left parietal lobe , and bilateral prefrontal cortices and occipital lobes in the normal control group ; bilateral parietal lobes and left dorsal lateral frontal cortex in the AD group ; and bilateral prefrontal cortices in the dAD group ; CONCLUSION : With quite different brain activation pattern , the dAD patients are more susceptible to the influence of emotional factors than AD patients .
17651704|Results also revealed a repetition-suppression effect for fearful faces in the right amygdala , which arose in healthy control subjects only , suggesting a lack of amygdala modulation by fear expression in 22q11DS .
17726086|Positron emission tomography scans revealed decreased relative activity in ventromedial temporal cortex -LRB- i.e. right amygdala/entorhinal cortex -RRB- and increased relative activity in bilateral prefrontal cortex with treatment .
17727949|MRI showed T1 hyperintensities in the right amygdala and predominantly in the cerebellum corresponding to melanocytic cells .
17762711|Citalopram enhanced the BOLD signal response in the left posterior insula -LRB- together with nonprespecified pulvinar and visual cortex -RRB- but attenuated activation in the left amygdala to disgusted faces and right amygdala activation to fearful faces .
17825533|Volumes of bilateral ventral anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- vACC -RRB- and right amygdala were significantly smaller in the MDD group than in the HC group .
17853295|The panic attack was associated with a significantly increased activity in the right amygdala .
17870235|Namely , the left amygdala was more active for successfully remembered female fearful faces in women , whereas in men the right amygdala was more involved in memory for male fearful faces .
17870614|In the orientation task , ignored fearful faces led to stronger activation in the right amygdala than ignored neutral faces .
17918712|The females showed activation both in the left and the right amygdala , greater in the former than in the latter -LRB- -LSB- 220.52 + / - 17.09 -RSB- mm3 vs. -LSB- 155.45 + / - 18.34 -RSB- mm3 , P < 0.05 -RRB- , but in the males only the left amygdala was activated .
17949901|There were no statistically significant differences in mean volumes for left or right amygdala .
17958489|Activity in the right amygdala also corresponded with memory for visual detail , although it did not relate to memory for the task performed with the item .
17987064|Treatment-related increases in functional coupling to frontal and other regions were greater for the left amygdala than for the right amygdala .
17996813|In contrast , signal changes in insula , left SII cortices and right amygdala did correlate with pain ratings and are therefore likely to encode for pain intensity .
18004139|Amygdala activation was evaluated during a facial emotion recognition test.The statistical comparison between placebo versus levodopa situations revealed a significant reduction in activation of right amygdala during the levodopa fMRI session .
18029095|Moreover , the degree of activation in the right amygdala for Fearful faces was significantly correlated with heart rate -LRB- Spearman 's rho = 0.55 , p = 0.018 , two-tailed -RRB- .
18030335|Most interestingly , when volunteers were required to give an overt aesthetic judgment , the images judged as beautiful selectively activated the right amygdala , relative to those judged as ugly .

20110703|Individuals with SMI had reduced volumes of the hippocampus bilaterally -LRB- right p = 0.001 ; left p < 0.001 -RRB- , the bilateral EC -LRB- right p = 0.031 , left p = 0.006 -RRB- and the right amygdala -LRB- p = 0.01 -RRB- compared to the control group .
20110703|CONCLUSION : Volume reduction of bilateral hippocampus , bilateral EC and right amygdala supports the concept of SMI as a very early manifestation of AD prior to MCI .
20141298|In addition , dispositional mindfulness was negatively correlated with resting activity in the amygdala , bilaterally , whereas depressive symptomatology was positively correlated with activity in the right amygdala .
20148332|During acquisition , fMRI results showed increased activation for the conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS + -LRB- unpaired -RRB- -RRB- when compared with the non-conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS - -RRB- in the right amygdala , the insulae , the anterior cingulate cortex and the parahippocampal gyrus , all regions known to be involved in emotional processing .
20148332|In addition , a linearly decreasing activation in the right amygdala/hippocampus for the CS - across the acquisition phase was found .
20150341|We found a positive correlation between right amygdala volume in girls -LRB- r = 0.29 -RRB- .

20159144|CONCLUSIONS : In BD , abnormally elevated right amygdala-OFC FC to sad stimuli might represent a trait vulnerability for depression , whereas abnormally elevated left amygdala-OFC FC to sad stimuli and abnormally reduced amygdala-OFC FC to intense happy stimuli might represent a depression state marker .

20191578|In FM patients with increased levels of pain intensity , greater fatigue , and more symptoms of depression , inositol levels in the right amygdala and right thalamus were significantly higher .
20191578|CONCLUSION : The distinctive metabolic features found in the right amygdala of patients with FM suggest the possible existence of a neural dysfunction in emotional processing .
20237128|Without methylphenidate , -LSB- 11C -RSB- - raclopride binding potential values were greater in apathetic patients bilaterally in the orbitofrontal , dorsolateral prefrontal , posterior cingulate and temporal cortices , left striatum and right amygdala , reflecting greater dopamine D2/D3 receptor density and/or reduced synaptic dopamine level in these areas .
20237871|In contrast , cerebral glucose metabolism was significantly decreased in both cerebellum , the left thalamus , the left olfactory , the right middle temporal gyrus , the right amygdala , and the right insula -LRB- P -LRB- uncorrected -RRB- < 0.005 -RRB- .
20307012|Results showed that for both MDD and control groups , the right amygdala displayed higher overall activity -LRB- across frequencies -RRB- than the left , both at rest , and while viewing neutral faces .

20357121|Medial temporal memory predictors were modulated by scene repetition : the right anterior hippocampus and right amygdala predicted memory for novel scenes only , whereas posterior hippocampi predicted memory for repeated scenes only .
20371508|Post hoc analyses revealed that whereas healthy volunteers had greater right amygdala activity to fearful versus neutral compared with happy versus neutral as expected , there were no valence differences in patients with conversion disorder .
20371508|The time course analysis also revealed greater right amygdala activity in patients with conversion disorder for happy stimuli -LRB- t = 2.96 , P = 0.006 -RRB- -LRB- with a trend for fearful stimuli , t = 1.81 , P = 0.08 -RRB- compared with healthy volunteers , with a pattern suggestive of impaired amygdala habituation even when controlling for depressive and anxiety symptoms .
20371508|Using psychophysiological interaction analysis , patients with conversion disorder had greater functional connectivity between the right amygdala and the right supplementary motor area during both fearful versus neutral , and happy versus neutral ` stimuli ' compared with healthy volunteers .
20371508|These results were confirmed with Granger Causality Modelling analysis indicating a directional influence from the right amygdala to the right supplementary motor area to happy stimuli -LRB- P < 0.05 -RRB- with a similar trend observed to fearful stimuli -LRB- P = 0.07 -RRB- .

20478833|However , the roles played here by the left and right amygdala individually remain unknown .
20478833|Here we investigated this question by applying the ` Bubbles ' method , which asks viewers to discriminate facial emotions from randomly sampled small regions of a face , to 23 neurological participants with focal , unilateral amygdala damage -LRB- 10 to the right amygdala -RRB- .

3197695|When continuous multiple spikes were transmitted to the left hippocampus -LRB- LH -RRB- , rCBF in the LH increased to 140 % of the baseline value , but in the right amygdala -LRB- RA -RRB- and left sensorimotor cortex -LRB- LCx -RRB- it remained unchanged .
3248190|Bipolar electrodes were placed in the lateral nuclei of bilateral amygdala -LRB- LA : left amygdala , RA : right amygdala -RRB- , and in the ipsilateral dorsal hippocampus -LRB- LH -RRB- .
3349969|This spontaneous phenomenon has only rarely been reported in the epilepsy literature but has been reported to be evoked by electrical stimulation of the right amygdala .

9184662|We have observed that single amyloid-beta 25-35 -LRB- A beta -RRB- injections -LRB- 5.0 nmol -RRB- into the right amygdala of rats produce progressive cytoskeletal and astrogliotic reactions not only within the amygdala , but also in distal brain regions that project to the amygdala .

9632050|Electrical kindling was initiated 28-35 days after the last alcohol dose by exposing the animals to daily electrical stimulations of the right amygdala .
9648549|The aversive saline condition , when contrasted with the water condition , increased activity in the right amygdala , left anterior orbitofrontal cortex , medial thalamus , pregenual and dorsal anterior cingulate , and the right hippocampus .

9990084|A subcortical pathway to the right amygdala mediating `` unseen '' fear .
9990084|We used measures of right amygdala neural activity acquired from volunteer subjects viewing masked fear-conditioned faces to determine whether a colliculo-pulvinar pathway was engaged during processing of these unseen target stimuli .
9990084|Increased connectivity between right amygdala , pulvinar , and superior colliculus was evident when fear-conditioned faces were unseen rather than seen .
9990084|These results suggest that a subcortical pathway to the right amygdala , via midbrain and thalamus , provides a route for processing behaviorally relevant unseen visual events in parallel to a cortical route necessary for conscious identification .
