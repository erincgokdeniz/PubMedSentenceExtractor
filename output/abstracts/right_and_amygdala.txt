22|We estimated total amygdala volumes in the left and the right hemisphere and did not find any lateralization in rats -LRB- t -LRB- 3 -RRB- = ? 0.606 , P = 0.587 -RRB- or in monkeys -LRB- t -LRB- 3 -RRB- = ? 1.222 , P = 0.309 -RRB- .
22|As there was no lateralization for overall amygdala size , we estimated the volumes of individual amygdala nuclei in the left hemisphere for half of the animals , and in the right hemisphere for the other half .
22|Neuron number was estimated in the right or in the left amygdala only , as for volume measurements .
22|Thus , our findings and all subsequent considerations are valid for , and can be generalized to , both left and right amygdala in both males and females .
