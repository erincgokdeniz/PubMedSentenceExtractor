10|Synaptic plasticity in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- underlies this form of associative learning .
10|In fear conditioning , the key circuits involve sensory areas that process the conditioned stimulus and unconditioned stimulus , regions of the amygdala that undergo plasticity during learning , and regions that control the expression of specific conditioned responses -LRB- Figure 2 and LeDoux , 2000 ; Fanselow and Poulos , 2005 ; Maren 2005 ; Davis and Whalen , 2001 ; Sotres-Bayon and Quirk , 2010 -RRB- .
10|As a result , the conditioned stimulus is then able to flow from the LA to the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CE -RRB- .
10|The LA connects with the CE directly and indirectly by way of the basal -LRB- B -RRB- and intercalated masses of the amygdala .
10|Although molecular changes occur in other areas of the amygdala , and other areas of the brain , the molecular contributions to LA plasticity as it relates to fear learning are understood in the most detail .
10|Also supporting the idea that enhancement of synaptic strength in the LA is important for fear learning , LTP , is occluded in amygdala slices from fear conditioned animals -LRB- Schroeder and Shinnick-Gallagher , 2004 ; Schroeder and Shinnick-Gallagher , 2005 ; Tsvetkov et al. , 2002 -RRB- , suggesting that LTP occurs during fear learning .
10|Further , LA cells that receive auditory inputs also receive unconditioned stimulus inputs -LRB- Romanski et al. , 1993 , Johansen et al. 2010b -RRB- and broad spectrum NMDAR antagonists -LRB- such as APV -RRB- microinjected into the LA and basal amygdala disrupt the acquisition of fear learning -LRB- Gewirtz and Davis , 1997 ; Maren et al. , 1996 ; Miserendino et al. , 1990 ; Rodrigues et al. , 2001 -RRB- .
10|Local amygdala GABAergic interneurons strongly modulate neural processing in LA projection neurons and LTP induction -LRB- Marowsky et al. , 2005 ; Bissiere et al. , 2003 , Tully et al. , 2007 ; Morozov et al. , 2011 -RRB- and this may serve as a mechanism to gate fear learning and/or memory consolidation .
10|Further , NE and DA are increased in the amygdala following presentation of aversive stimuli -LRB- Galvez et al. , 1996 ; Quirarte et al. , 1998 ; Yokoyama et al. , 2005 ; Young and Rees , 1998 -RRB- .
10|b. Dopamine -- Other studies suggest that dopamine receptor activation -LRB- both D1 and D2 receptor subtypes -RRB- in the amygdala contributes to the acquisition of fear conditioning -LRB- Greba et al. , 2001 ; Guarraci et al. , 2000 ; Guarraci et al. , 1999 ; Nader and LeDoux , 1999 -RRB- .
10|However , in the amygdala it appears that D1 receptors are not Gs coupled , but may instead stimulate phospholipase C -LRB- PLC -RRB- and IP3 production -LRB- Leonard et al. , 2003 -RRB- .
10|It will be important in future work to utilize new optical and genetic tools to more carefully test the plasticity rules -LRB- i.e. the temporal , spatial and molecular mechanisms -RRB- in the amygdala involved in instantiating fear learning .
10|Thus , CREB is phosphorylated in the amygdala following fear memory reactivation -LRB- Hall et al. , 2001b -RRB- and forebrain expression of a CREB repressor reduces fear memory reconsolidation -LRB- Kida et al. , 2002 -RRB- .
10|Two proteins that contain CRE sites in their genes are CFOS and Egr-1 and both are upregulated in the amygdala following fear memory reactivation -LRB- Hall et al. , 2001a ; Hall et al. , 2001b -RRB- .
10|A key brain region for the learning and memory in all mammals , including humans , is the amygdala .
10|Studies in rodents have shown that plasticity occurs in the LA of the amygdala during learning , and this is also where memories are consolidated .
10|Fear Conditioning Circuit Convergence of the auditory conditioned stimulus and nociceptive unconditioned stimulus in the amygdala is essential for fear conditioning .
10|Convergence of conditioned and unconditioned stimuli occurs in lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- , especially in the dorsal subnucleus -LRB- LAd -RRB- , leading to synaptic plasticity in LA. .
11|We will focus on Pavlovian fear conditioning as a model and the amygdala as a key component for the acquisition and extinction of fear responses .
11|As a result , the amygdala has been identified as a key region for the processing of aversive signals and fear learning in various species including humans -LRB- for reviews see -LRB- 37,274,299,369,464,473 -RRB- -RRB- .
11|We will focus on Pavlovian fear conditioning as a model and the amygdala as a key component of conditioned fear responses .
11|Structure and connectivity of the amygdala Located in the anterior portion of the temporal lobe , the amygdala is comprised of a dozen or so nuclei and cortex-like structures .
11|Since many comprehensive reviews on the structure and connectivity of the amygdala have been published before -LRB- 9,371 -RRB- , we will limit the following account to components of the amygdala that are thought to be involved in the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear responses .
11|The dominant group -LRB- ? 80 % -RRB- are glutamatergic projection cells with multipolar dendritic trees covered with spines and axons contributing multiple collaterals to neighboring BLA cells , amygdala nuclei , or other structures of the brain -LRB- 146,147,191,289 -RRB- .
11|This statement is based on a neurochemical study where interruption of the main pathways linking the amygdala with the rest of the brain decreases GAD levels in CE , but not BLA -LRB- 236 -RRB- .
11|Intercalated -LRB- ITC -RRB- cell masses -- As a group , ITC cells form a reticulated sheet of neurons that spans the entire rostrocaudal extent of the amygdala -LRB- 311 -RRB- .
11|ITC neurons occur as small densely packed cell clusters distributed in the main fiber bundles found in and around the amygdala .
11|In addition , in most species , there is a larger ITC cell mass : in cats , it caps the amygdala rostrally -LRB- 359 -RRB- whereas in rats is it located dorsomedial to the basal nuclei -LRB- 339 -RRB- .
11|In this species , CE is dorsomedial to BLA such that the lateromedial axis in the guinea pig amygdala corresponds to the dorsoventral axis in the rat amygdala .
11|C. Internuclear connections A prominent feature of amygdala organization is the existence of strong and directionally polarized inter-nuclear connections -LRB- Fig. 2B ; -LRB- 362,377 -RRB- -RRB- .
11|Here , it should be noted that whereas the basal amygdala nuclei project to CEl and CEm , LA only projects to CEl .
11|Given the contrasting projections of CEl and CEm to the brainstem -LRB- 162,368 -RRB- , this point will become critical when considering the intra-amygdala pathways participating in fear conditioning .
11|Basic organizing principles of amygdala connectivity -- The amygdala forms connections with an extremely diverse array of structures including cortex , striatum , some thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei , as well as various basal forebrain structures and brainstem nuclei -LRB- reviewed in -LRB- 9,371 -RRB- -RRB- .
11|As a result , the amygdala is in a position to influence a wide variety of processes from autonomic and motor control to memory formation and neuromodulation .
11|Here , we first highlight basic organizing principles of amygdala connectivity and then consider in more detail the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways thought to participate in the acquisition and expression of conditioned fear responses .
11|Different amygdala nuclei project to different classes of CNS structures : There is a clear segregation of target structures depending on the amygdala nuclei originating the projections .
11|Indeed , cortical and striatal projections of the amygdala originate from the BLA , not from CE -LRB- 215,217,218 -RRB- .
11|As to ITC cells , they do not project outside the amygdala , except for a projection from the main ITC group to the substantia innominata and diagonal band of Broca -LRB- horizontal limb -RRB- -LRB- 360 -RRB- .
11|The amygdala receives information about all sensory modalities : Depending on the modality , sensory information can reach the amygdala via the thalamus , cortex , or more direct subcortical routes .
11|Generally , sensory inputs from cortex do not originate from primary sensory areas but reach the amygdala after a cascade of corticocortical projections involving one or more associative cortical areas -LRB- 286 -RRB- .
11|We will consider the origin and termination of sensory inputs to the amygdala in more detail below , in the context of fear conditioning .
11|Many more cortical areas project to the amygdala than targeted by the amygdala : Indeed , a diverse array of associative and polymodal cortical areas project to the amygdala -LRB- 286,436 -RRB- .
11|Cortical inputs to the amygdala originate from different layers depending on the target nucleus : Paralleling the cortex-like nature of BLA and striatal-like properties of CE , cortical inputs to BLA and CE mainly originate from layer III and layer V pyramidal cells , respectively -LRB- 52,436 -RRB- .
11|The amygdala sends robust projections to neuromodulatory cell groups of the brainstem and basal forebrain : While most prosencephalic structures , including the amygdala -LRB- 112 -RRB- , receive inputs from neuromodulatory systems -LRB- 485 -RRB- , relatively few contribute dense projections to these cell groups .
11|The amygdala is a notable exception to this general rule .
11|Via these projections , the amygdala can influence the general excitability of much of the brain , even of structures it is not directly connected to .
11|In turn , because the neuromodulatory inputs often exert facilitating influences on synaptic plasticity -LRB- 1,150 -RRB- , these pathways likely enhance the formation of Pavlovian associations and may partly explain how the amygdala facilitates memory formation for emotionally arousing experiences -LRB- 299 -RRB- .
11|With the exception of substantial BLA projections to the substantia innominata and diagonal band of Broca -LRB- 184,215 -RRB- , most amygdala projections to neuromodulatory cell groups originate in CE .
11|E. Input and output pathways involved in fear conditioning Because most data on the cellular and molecular substrates of fear conditioning was obtained using auditory CSs paired with footshocks as USs , the following will focus on sensory pathways relaying auditory and nociceptive inputs to the amygdala .
11|As we shall see , CS and US information can reach the amygdala through multiple routes -LRB- Fig. 2C -RRB- .
11|The above routes of CS and US communication to the amygdala have been studied extensively and figure prominently in most models of auditory fear conditioning .
11|However , other paths exist for the transfer of CS information to the amygdala , but they have received little attention so far .
11|PO could relay CS information to the amygdala .
11|Similarly , there are other routes for US information to reach the amygdala and they too bypass LA. .
11|Amygdala outputs generating conditioned fear -- There is general consensus that the main output station of the amygdala for conditioned fear responses to cues is CE -LRB- reviewed in -LRB- 88 -RRB- ; however see -LRB- 213 -RRB- -RRB- .
11|Links between the input and output stations of the amygdala -- Behavioral freezing is the most commonly monitored measure of conditioned fear .
11|Importantly , amygdala projections to the brainstem site mediating freezing -LRB- PAG -RRB- originate exclusively in CEm .
11|Overall , the evidence reviewed above suggest that fear conditioning depends on distributed plasticity in the amygdala .
11|In conclusion , theta synchronization appears to be an important organizing principle for creating time windows of fear memory consolidation within extended hippocampal-amygdala-prefrontal cortical networks .
11|Synaptic plasticity in the amygdala related to conditioned fear Central to the mechanisms of learning and memory are changes in synaptic efficacy , which take place during learning and are stabilized during memory consolidation .
11|While initial studies focused on the thalamus and cortex as possible sites of fear memory storage , subsequent lesion and electrophysiological studies indicated that the amygdala is a site of associative plasticity for Pavlovian fear memories -LRB- 14,194,364 -RRB- .
11|Converging evidence over the last three decades has supported the hypothesis that LTP of synaptic inputs that transmit CS information to the amygdala underlies the increase in fear responsiveness to the CS .
11|Core support for this view comes from three major lines of evidence : a -RRB- fear conditioning causes a facilitation of responses to afferents relaying CS information to the amygdala , b -RRB- LTP occurs at these afferent inputs , and c -RRB- fear conditioning and LTP share a common set of mechanisms affected similarly by a range of experimental manipulations .
11|The various forms of long-term synaptic plasticity described in amygdala neurons are schematically illustrated in figure 6 .
11|The major sensory input station to the amygdala is LA. .
11|This increased activity is relayed to the central amygdala -LRB- CE -RRB- , the main output station for fear responses .
11|First , fear conditioning induces changes in efficacy at afferent synaptic inputs to the amygdala -- This has been shown , mostly in LAd , by extra - and intracellular recordings of CS-evoked firing in vivo -LRB- 80,139,390,404,414,419 -RRB- and by recordings of synaptic responses to afferent stimulation in brain slices in vitro obtained from fearconditioned animals -LRB- 301,502,538 -RRB- .
11|Second , LTP occurs at synaptic inputs to the amygdala -- This has been demonstrated in vivo in anesthetized -LRB- 78,413,531 -RRB- and freely behaving animals -LRB- 101 -RRB- , as well as in vitro in slice preparations -LRB- 69,164,166,170,497,503,519 -RRB- .
11|Third , fear conditioning and LTP share a common set of mechanisms -- The demonstration that intra-amygdala infusion of NMDA receptor antagonists blocks the induction -LRB- but not expression -RRB- of conditioned fear in vivo and of LTP in vitro provided the basis for the hypothesis that NMDA receptor-mediated LTP represents a cellular substrate of fear conditioning -LRB- 22,61,166,206,314 -RRB- .
11|Early studies yielded evidence for the additional contribution of L-type voltage-gated Ca2 + channels -LRB- 166,468,524 -RRB- or questioned the involvement of NMDA receptors in amygdala LTP -LRB- 69 -RRB- .
11|That these receptor subunits are important for conditioned fear is supported by the finding that intra-amygdala infusion of ifenprodil , a NR2B receptor antagonist , disrupts the acquisition -- but not the expression - of conditioned fear -LRB- 411 -RRB- .
11|In keeping with this , NMDA receptors present on principal amygdala neurons -LRB- 259 -RRB- and GABAergic interneurons -LRB- 498 -RRB- contain NR2B subunits , particularly at thalamoamygdala synapses -LRB- 391 -RRB- , and application of ifenprodil blocks LTP at thalamic input pathways to principal LA neurons in vitro -LRB- 22 -RRB- .
11|Inspired by these findings , many pharmacological and genetic studies have targeted molecular processes involved in cellular and behavioral plasticity in the amygdala -LRB- reviewed by -LRB- 412 -RRB- -RRB- and shed light on the mechanisms underlying long-term plasticity in the amygdala .
11|Furthermore , activation of group II mGluRs evokes long-term depression -LRB- LTD -RRB- of synaptic transmission in the amygdala -LRB- 153,255 -RRB- .
11|Two lines of evidence support the notion that PKM? and AMPA-R trafficking are also critical for synaptic plasticity in the amygdala and conditioned fear .
11|After transfection through localized injection into the amygdala , animals were fear-conditioned , and plasticity was examined at the behavioral and synaptic levels in vivo and in vitro , respectively .
11|The regulated transport of AMPA-Rs towards exocytosis and endocytosis at synaptic sites seems to be important for balanced plasticity in the amygdala .
11|Recent evidence suggests that regulated trafficking in the amygdala is not restricted to AMPA-Rs .
11|NR2B subunits can be tyrosine-phosphorylated , and mice with a knock-in mutation of the major phosphorylation site -LRB- Tyr-1472 -RRB- show impaired fear learning and reduced amygdala LTP , accompanied by improper localization of the NR2B subunits at amygdala synapses -LRB- 334 -RRB- .
11|What evidence indicates that these pathways are involved in long-term synaptic plasticity in the amygdala and conditioned fear ?
11|Upstream of ERK/MAPK is the RAS signalling pathway , which has been implicated in fear memory and synaptic plasticity in the amygdala .
11|Mice with a null mutation of RIN1 , a RAS effector that competitively inhibits the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway and is preferentially expressed in dendrites , show an enhancement of amygdala LTP and amygdala-dependent aversive memories like fear conditioning -LRB- 92 -RRB- .
11|Fear conditioning induced activation of ERK1/2 in the amygdala as well as a de novo translation of STEP , whereas infusion of a substrate-trapping STEP protein prevented translocation to the nucleus , disrupted LTP in LA , and impaired fear memory consolidation .
11|Together , these data support the hypothesis that ERK1/2 signalling and translocation to the nucleus play an important role in the maintenance of synaptic plasticity and consolidation of conditioned fear in the amygdala .
11|A convergent line of evidence indicates that BDNF plays a role in amygdala-dependent learning and memory -LRB- reviewed by -LRB- 36,346,400 -RRB- -RRB- .
11|BDNF mRNA is elevated during the consolidation of conditioned fear memory -LRB- 401 -RRB- , and BDNF blockade in the amygdala through expression of a dominant negative isoform or antagonism of the tyrosine kinase receptor B -LRB- TrkB -RRB- interferes with long-term fear memory -LRB- 399 -RRB- .
11|Upon fear conditioning , the level of TrkB receptor immunostaining declines in the amygdala , whereas the level of phosphorylated TrK receptors increases , suggesting TrK activation and internalization by BDNF binding -LRB- 400 -RRB- .
11|One of its targets , p70s6 kinase , is upregulated after fear training , and prevention of this upregulation by post-training injection of rapamycin into the amygdala , blocked the fear memory formation -LRB- 155 -RRB- .
11|Interestingly , when rapamycin was infused in the amygdala after fear memory recall , subsequent retention was disrupted , suggesting that local translational control is required for the formation as well as the stability of long-term fear memories .
11|The significance of correlated activity in circuits of the amygdala and beyond is discussed in section III of the present review .
11|A number of other cytoskeletal-regulatory proteins also contribute to synaptic plasticity and fear learning in the amygdala .
11|Persistent expression of neuroligin-1 is indeed required for maintenance of NMDA-R mediated synaptic transmission , enabling normal development of synaptic plasticity and long-term memory in the amygdala -LRB- 203 -RRB- .
11|The expression of PSA-NCAM increased 24 h after fear conditioning in the amygdala , but only in animals subjected to the highest shock intensity , and intra-amygdala cleavage of PSANCAM affected fear extinction rather than acquisition or consolidation of cued fear memory -LRB- 276 -RRB- .
11|C. Emerging views on distributed synaptic plasticity In the previous sections , we described converging lines of evidence indicating that Pavlovian fear conditioning depends on mechanisms of enduring synaptic plasticity in the amygdala .
11|These time windows may then facilitate synaptic plasticity in distributed networks involving local neuronal circuits within the amygdala , or neuromodulatory input systems -LRB- reviewed in -LRB- 299 -RRB- -RRB- .
11|An overview of the forms of long-term synaptic plasticity detected at the various inputs to types of neurons in the amygdala is provided in figure 6 .
11|Long-term pre - and postsynaptic plasticity in principal amygdala neurons -- In addition to thalamic inputs , principal LA neurons receive inputs from the cerebral cortex .
11|In addition to LTP dependent on postsynaptic NMDA receptors , some forms of LTP depend on presynaptic NMDA receptors in the amygdala .
11|The spatio-temporal architecture of the intra-amygdala network may thus be tuned to facilitate coincidence of the two sensory afferent input systems , as for instance , during synaptic plasticity and fear learning -LRB- 182 -RRB- .
11|GABAergic plasticity -- There is ample evidence that GABAergic interneurons regulate signal flow through the amygdala -LRB- 87,229 -RRB- , thereby modulating synaptic plasticity in principal cells and influencing fear learning and extinction -LRB- reviewed in -LRB- 105 -RRB- -RRB- .
11|Consistent with such a balancing function of presynaptic GABAB on LTP in the amygdala , a genetic deficiency of GABAB -LRB- 1a -RRB- receptors resulted in a shift from the associative , NMDA receptor-dependent form of LTP towards a non-associative , NMDA receptor-independent form of presynaptic LTP at cortico-amygdala afferents -LRB- 465 -RRB- .
11|B. Cerebral networks involved in extinction Three interconnected brain regions have been implicated in extinction : the amygdala , mPFC , and hippocampal formation .
11|Increasing evidence suggests that the amygdala is the critical site of plasticity where the extinction memory is stored .
11|To understand how the amygdala , mPFC , and hippocampus interact in extinction , we must first consider the connections existing between these structures .
11|Connections between the amygdala and mPFC -- Two components of the mPFC are most densely interconnected with the amygdala : the infralimbic and prelimbic areas -LRB- 286,436,463 -RRB- .
11|The amygdala sends return projections to the mPFC -LRB- 218 -RRB- .
11|Overall , the data reviewed above suggests that the impact of mPFC inputs to the amygdala depends on the cortical field at the origin of the projection and the target nuclei .
11|Hippocampal projections to the amygdala and mPFC -- The results of lesion and/or reversible inactivation studies indicate that the hippocampus is required for the renewal of cued conditioned fear responses after extinction training -LRB- reviewed in -LRB- 180 -RRB- -RRB- .
11|However , it is currently unclear how this contextual information is relayed to the amygdala .
11|A number of possible routes exist including direct CA1 , subicular , and entorhinal projections to various components of the amygdala -LRB- Fig. 7B -RRB- .
11|In addition , it is possible that one or more of these sources influences the amygdala indirectly -LRB- Fig. 7B -RRB- , via the mPFC projections described above .
11|Therefore , it seems that multiple parallel routes convey contextual information to the amygdala and that normal contextual gating of extinction depends on intact coding in theses multiple parallel pathways .
11|However , an alternative interpretation is that in some of these cases at least , the lack of renewal observed following localized lesions or inactivations reflects a disfacilitation of critical amygdala targets rather than the specific signalling of information about the renewal context .
11|Nevertheless , since the available data is compatible with both interpretations , we now overview the various possible routes through which contextual information from the hippocampus might reach the amygdala .
11|See Refs -LRB- 286,376 -RRB- for projections to other amygdala nuclei .
11|It should be noted that most of the projections described below are reciprocated by the amygdala .
11|Direct hippocampal projections to the amygdala : Most direct hippocampal projections to the amygdala originate from the temporal subiculum and , to a lesser extent , the adjacent part of CA1 -LRB- 62,286,345,376,506,507 -RRB- .
11|There are no dentate and CA3 outputs to the amygdala .
11|CA1 projections to the amygdala are considerably lighter than those originating in the subiculum .
11|Entorhinal projections to the amygdala : Entorhinal efferents to the amygdala mainly originate from deep -LRB- layer V-VI -RRB- neurons .
11|MPFC transfer of hippocampal outputs to the amygdala : In addition to the direct subicular , CA1 , and entorhinal projections described above , contextual information can reach the amygdala via the mPFC .
11|C. Mechanisms of synaptic plasticity underlying extinction learning and consolidation Overall , the available data indicate that extinction learning and expression relies on a tripartite synaptic circuit , including the amygdala for storing of both conditioned fear and extinction , the hippocampus for processing of contextual information , and the infralimbic region of the mPFC for the consolidation and retrieval of extinction memory -LRB- 190,274,308,327,389 -RRB- .
11|In addition , different types of neurons in the basal amygdala signal fear memory or extinction , which may shift the balance between the context-dependent expression of fear and or extinction after conditioning -LRB- 157 -RRB- .
11|Fear extinction depends on the amygdala at all postnatal stages investigated -LRB- 205,274,327 -RRB- , whereas the mPFC is involved in fear extinction in adult but not young animals -LRB- 204 -RRB- .
11|In an elegant series of experiments , Gogolla and coworkers -LRB- 138 -RRB- have shown that erasure-resistant fear memories are mediated by the formation of perineuronal nets composed of extracellular matrix chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans in the amygdala during a postnatal critical period .
11|As mGluR7 is localized to presynaptic terminals of glutamatergic neurons in the amygdala and negatively coupled to the adenylyl cyclase/cAMP system -LRB- 281 -RRB- , a decrease in presynaptic glutamate release may contribute to extinction learning , although it remains unclear how impaired fear acquisition can coincide with facilitated fear extinction .
11|During contextual fear conditioning , there is an increased expression of CREB and CREB-dependent Arc in the amygdala and hippocampus after short re-exposure , and in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex after long re-exposure , suggesting that re-activated contextual fear memories undergo CREB-dependent reconsoldation or extinction in distinct brain areas -LRB- 269 -RRB- .
11|As to NCAM , intraamygdala cleavage of PSA-NCAM did not affect acquisition , consolidation or expression of remote fear memories , nor within-session extinction , but strengthened extinction memory -LRB- 276 -RRB- .
11|In fact , the expression of various GABA-related genes seems to be differentially regulated in the amygdala .
11|Together , these findings indicate that the acquisition of conditioned fear induces a downregulation of markers related to GABAergic function in the amygdala , whereas the acquisition of fear extinction produces an upregulation of GABAergic markers .
11|Furthermore , cell-permeable TAT-conjugated peptide -LRB- TAT -RRB- - GABA receptor-associated protein -LRB- GABARAP -RRB- inhibitory peptide that blocked GABAA receptor insertion in the amygdala interfered with both extinction-induced increase in miniature IPSCs and reduction of fear-potentiated startle responses .
11|Therefore , they are situated in an ideal position to control signal flow within the amygdala -LRB- 427 -RRB- .
11|Also co-localized with GABA in local-circuit amygdala neurons is NPY -LRB- 296,479 -RRB- .
11|In conclusion , extinction training is followed by a consolidation phase , which recruits much of the same molecular machinery involved in the acquisition of conditioned fear -LRB- Fig. 9 -RRB- , and involves a spatially distributed synaptic network including the amygdala , hippocampus , and the mPFC for storing of extinction , processing of contextual information , and determination of extinction retrieval , respectively .
11|Depotentiation can be induced in the amygdala by low frequency stimulation in vitro , reverses fear traininginduced LTP ex vivo , and is associated with a loss of acquired fear responses .
11|In a comprehensive set of experiments , Gean and colleagues have identified a key signal in depotentiation and fear extinction : the phosphatase calcineurin -LRB- protein phosphatase 2B -RRB- , which targets and inactivates through de-phosphorylation a number of kinases critical for long-term potentiation and conditioned fear in the amygdala -LRB- 249-251 ,253 -RRB- .
11|The exact mechanisms of depotentiation in the amygdala , particularly the involvement of NMDA-Rs , MAPK and protein synthesis , remain to be clarified -LRB- 253 -RRB- .
11|Because Tat-GluR23Y interferes with LTD , and AMPA-R endocytosis is associated with LTD at thalamic inputs in the amygdala -LRB- 535 -RRB- , the authors suggested that LTD may be a mechanism that links AMPA-R endocytosis to fear extinction -LRB- 86 -RRB- .
11|Furthermore , extinction may involve structural alterations opposing those induced by fear conditioning , as indicated by an increase in expression of PSA-NCAM 24 h post fear training in the amygdala -LRB- 276 -RRB- .
11|In keeping with this , intraamygdala cleavage of PSA-NCAM affected fear extinction rather than acquisition or consolidation of cued fear -LRB- 276 -RRB- .
11|Together , these data suggest that fear extinction include early processes which may reset fear conditioning-induced plastic changes in the amygdala , through synaptic depotentiation or depression , distributed AMPA-R endocytosis , and kinase de-phosphorylation -LRB- Fig. 9 -RRB- .
11|These findings , coupled to the preserved ability of the CS to evoke conditioned fear following extinction training , raise the intriguing possibility that different pathways convey CS information to the amygdala before vs. after extinction training .
11|In order for renewal and reinstatement to exist , some pathway still has to convey enhanced CS information to the amygdala after extinction .
11|Instead , these phenomena suggest that extinction training causes a re-organization of the fear memory ; a change in the networks primarily responsible for supporting CS transfer to the amygdala .
11|If , as suggested by the depotentiation studies , thalamic inputs are depressed by extinction training , what pathway -LRB- s -RRB- might support the transfer of CS information to the amygdala ?
11|Indeed , these areas contribute direct projections to the amygdala as well as indirect ones , via the rhinal cortices -LRB- 286 -RRB- .
11|According to this view , context can be represented as a set of distinct features , each of which may enter into association with the aversive event via functional links to the amygdala .
11|Alternatively , the distinct features of the situation may be bound into a new representation encoding their co-occurrence or conjunction and , for association with the aversive events , further links to the amygdala .
11|These findings raise the intriguing possibility that the two representations of context make a different contribution before versus after extinction , with neocortical/hippocampal interactions and their influence on the amygdala being critically involved in the contextual components of extinction .
11|Besides the system-level alterations in the pathways supporting CS transfer to the amygdala , there are widespread changes in the expression of GABA receptors , in the rate of GABA synthesis , as well as activity-dependent potentiation of BL inputs to ITC cells , resulting in the inhibition of fear output neurons .

12|Previous studies have clearly identified the amygdala as a key brain structure for acquisition and storage of fear memory traces .
12|Here , we review current understanding and emerging concepts of how local inhibitory circuits in the amygdala control the acquisition , expression , and extinction of conditioned fear at different levels .
12|This situation is starting to change as recent studies point to key roles of inhibitory mechanisms within the amygdala during fear and extinction memory acquisition and expression .
12|Here , we review some of these results and point out how inhibitory circuits contribute to both acquisition and expression of memory traces by multiple mechanisms and at multiple levels in the amygdala .
12|The amygdala is one of the key brain structures for fear memory acquisition and storage , a notion consistently supported by a large number of studies using different experimental paradigms and measures of conditioned fear responses -LRB- Davis , 2000 ; Fanselow and Poulos , 2005 ; LeDoux , 2000 ; Maren , 2001 -RRB- .
12|In addition , the amygdala also modulates fear-related learning in other brain structures , such as the cortex and the hippocampus -LRB- McGaugh , 2004 -RRB- .
12|The amygdala consists of several anatomically and functionally distinct nuclei , including the lateral -LRB- LA -RRB- and basal -LRB- BA -RRB- nuclei -LRB- together referred to as the basolateral amygdala -- BLA -RRB- and the central nucleus -LRB- CEA -RRB- -LRB- Krettek and Price , 1978b -RRB- -LRB- Figure 1A -RRB- .
12|The cytoarchitecture and organization of amygdala nuclei are similar to that of other parts of the telencephalon .
12|An interesting addition to the cortex - and striatum-like nuclear organization is the presence of intercalated cell masses -LRB- ITCs -RRB- in the amygdala .
12|One of the main flows of information within the amygdala follows a serial path in the direction of the main internuclear projections , while other parallel inputs and outputs exist -LRB- Pitka ¨ - nen et al. , 1997 ; Sah et al. , 2003 -RRB- .
12|In addition , amygdala nuclei are unidirectionally or reciprocally connected to many cortical and subcortical brain structures , which participate in generating behaviorally relevant outputs -LRB- McDonald , 1991 , 1998 ; McDonald et al. , 1996 ; Pitka ¨ nen , 2000 ; Pitka ¨ nen et al. , 2000 -RRB- .
12|Together with the multitude of inter - and intranuclear projections , this suggests that information can be processed both by mechanisms intrinsic to amygdala networks as well as modified by interactions with other brain structures to integrate sensory inputs , generate fear response outputs , and modulate fear responses according to circumstances , such as in fear extinction -LRB- Pitka ¨ nen et al. , 1997 ; Sah et al. , 2003 -RRB- .
12|Although previous research has mostly focused on the role of glutamatergic transmission and plasticity , there is accumulating evidence indicating that local inhibitory circuits in the amygdala contribute to , or even mediate , important aspects of fear conditioning and extinction .
12|It is intriguing that , at multiple levels in the amygdala , inhibitory neurons are major targets of neuromodulatory systems -LRB- Asan , 1998 ; Cassell et al. , 1999 ; Fuxe et al. , 2003 ; Muller et al. , 2007b ; Pinard et al. , 2008 -RRB- .
12|This may allow inhibition-dependent functions of amygdala networks to be adjusted according to the environmental conditions and the behavioral state of the animal .
12|The amygdala microcircuitry has not been studied as extensively as that of other cortical and basal ganglia structures .
12|An intriguing aspect of amygdala circuit organization is that it combines cortex-like and striatum-like structures .
12|A key question is how the tasks of memory acquisition and the storage of multiple memory traces are distributed and implemented among these fundamentally different networks in the amygdala .
12|Here , we review evidence that inhibitory circuits in cortex - and striatum-like amygdala BA CEl CEm LA mITC ITC lITC CEl CEm ITC LA mITC BA lITC Sensory input Fear GABAergic neurons A B C ITC LA BA Sensory input Fear CEl mITC lITC CEm GABAergic neuron Projection neuron Figure 1 .
12|LA , lateral amygdala ; BA , basal amygdala ; CEl , latero-capsular subdivision of the central amygdala ; CEm , medial subdivision of the central amygdala ; mITC , medial intercalated cell cluster ; lITC , lateral intercalated cell cluster .
12|Understanding theses processes within the framework of the unique organization of the amygdala and the powerful paradigm of fear conditioning could help shed light on general principles of memory acquisition and storage in cortico-striatal circuits in general .
12|In addition , neuromodulators that are released in the amygdala upon stress can gate induction of plasticity by transiently suppressing preor postsynaptic inhibition .
12|The amygdala exhibits theta activity that phase-locks with hippocampal theta during retrieval of aversive memories -LRB- Pare ´ et al. , 2002 ; Seidenbecher et al. , 2003 -RRB- .
12|One subpopulation of CEl neurons sends confined inhibitory projections to CEm and other targets within the so-called central extended amygdala , such as the BNST , whereas another subpopulation also projects to targets outside of the central extended amygdala , including the lateral hypothalamus and the parabrachial nucleus -LRB- PB -RRB- , while both subpopulations have local collaterals also -LRB- Veinante and Freund-Mercier , 1998 , 2003 -RRB- .
12|The CEl receives BLA inputs and substantial inputs from areas outside the amygdala , including sensory and higher-order cortical areas , and from subcortical structures such as the PB -LRB- McDonald , 1998 ; Savander et al. , 1995 ; Sun et al. , 1994 ; Yasui et al. , 1991 -RRB- .
12|Importantly , this tonic inhibition reduced the excitability of CEm neurons , so that they were less likely to fire action potentials when glutamatergic inputs from the BA and basomedial amygdala were activated -LRB- Huber et al. , 2005 -RRB- .
12|However , there are other possibilities , given the known amygdala circuitry .
12|Intercalated Cells Relay Feedforward Inhibition The last main players conferring inhibitory control onto multiple targets in the amygdala are the ITCs .
12|Together , this has led to the concept that ITCs function as an inhibitory gate for input and output stations of the amygdala -LRB- Pape , 2005 ; Pare ´ et al. , 2004 -RRB- and could be a major regulatory site controlling CEAexcitability and fear expression -LRB- Pare ´ et al. , 2003 -RRB- -LRB- Figure 1C -RRB- .
12|Such a topographic organization would allow for different sets of ITCs to shape amygdala output differentially : for example , the most lateral mITCs could inhibit CEl and medial mITCs , resulting in disinhibition of CEm , whereas activation of more medial mITCs by BA inputs could lead to direct inhibition of CEm -LRB- Pare ´ et al. , 2003 -RRB- -LRB- Figure 3A -RRB- .
12|The prevailing hypotheses are that lITCs gate information relayed from cortical afferents to the main sensory interface -LRB- BLA -RRB- and that mITCs gate information transfer between the principal input -LRB- BLA -RRB- and output stations -LRB- CEA -RRB- of the amygdala .
12|However , ITC clusters receive the densest dopaminergic afferents in the amygdala and express high levels of D1 receptors -LRB- Fuxe et al. , 2003 -RRB- .
12|Such changes in inhibitory drive could occur in several brain structures , since accumulating evidence points to extinction memory being encoded in a distributed network including the amygdala , hippocampus , and prefrontal cortex -LRB- Myers and Davis , 2007 ; Quirk and Mueller , 2008 -RRB- .
12|Here , we focus on the critical role of the amygdala in acquisition and expression of extinction .
12|One current model is that , following extinction learning , activation of mITCs by amygdalaintrinsic or - extrinsic glutamatergic afferents -LRB- e.g. , from the mPFC -RRB- leads to inhibition of their targets in the CEA , suppressing CEm output and fear responses -LRB- Figure 3B -RRB- .
12|Stimulation of the IL in vivo reduces CEA output , and mITCs have been proposed to mediate this inhibition -LRB- Quirk et al. , 2003 ; Berretta et al. , 2005 -RRB- , thus linking enhanced IL activity to decreased amygdala output and decreased fear responses .
12|Behaviorally , NPS facilitates extinction training when locally applied in the amygdala , while NPS receptor antagonists attenuate both acquisition and retrieval of extinction memory , suggesting a critical role for endogenous NPS .
12|On the network level , NPS enhanced feedforward inhibition from BLA to CEA -LRB- Ju ¨ ngling et al. , 2008 -RRB- , which may result in inhibition of amygdala output and reduction of the fear response .
12|Conclusions Over the past two decades , the main focus of research on the neuronal substrates of associative learning has been on the function of glutamatergic projection neurons in the cortex-like nuclei of the amygdala and in other brain regions , as well as on the mechanisms underlying long-term synaptic plasticity at glutamatergic synapses .
12|Recent work reviewed here indicates , however , that addressing the functions of local inhibitory circuits may be key to achieving a deeper understanding of amygdala circuit function in the context of classical conditioning .
12|First , inhibition in the lateral amygdala gates the induction of synaptic plasticity .
12|Inhibitory gating of LTP induction is not unique to the amygdala and has been described in other brain areas .
12|However , addressing these issues in the amygdala offers the possibility to relate increased or decreased gating efficiency to behavioral consequences , such as specificity or generalization of associative learning .
12|It is clear that we are just starting to understand the role of amygdala inhibitory circuits in fear memory coding and that a number of important questions wait to be addressed .
12|Why is it , for example that in the amygdala two fundamentally different circuit structures , one cortex-like and the other striatum-like , are combined in order to control fear behavior and to acquire and store fear memories ?
16|IO -LRB- 4 -RRB- : 1062-1069 The Lateral Amygdaloid in Fear Conditioning Nucleus : Sensory Interface Amygdala Joseph E. LeDoux , ' Piera Cicchetti , * Andrew Xagoraris , * and Lizabeth M. Romanski * ` Center For Neural Science , New York University , New York , New York 10003 , and * Laboratory of Neurobiology , Cornell University Medical College , New York , New York 10021 Previous work has implicated projections from the acoustic thalamus to the amygdala in the classical conditioning of emotional responses to auditory stimuli .
16|The purpose of the present studies was to determine whether the lateral amygdaloid nucleus -LRB- AL -RRB- , which is a major subcortical target of projections from the acoustic thalamus , might be the sensory interface of the amygdala in emotional conditioning .
16|AL is thus an essential link in the circuitry through which auditory stimuli are endowed with affective properties and may function as the sensory interface of the amygdala during emotional learning .
16|Considerable evidence now suggests that the amygdala , and particularly the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- ACE -RRB- , is an essential link in the neural circuit underlying aversive emotional conditioning -LRB- fear conditioning -RRB- : lesions or pharmacological ma - Received June 9 , 1989 ; revised Aug. 24 , 1989 ; accepted Sept. 19 , 1989 .
16|An important issue thus concerns the afferent pathways through which the amygdala receives information about sensory stimuli .
16|Although projections from modality-specific sensory processing areas of the neocortex to the amygdala exist -LRB- Whitlock and Nauta , 1956 ; Jones and Powell , 1970 ; Herzog and van Hoesen , 1975 ; Aggleton et al. , 1980 ; Turner et al. , 1980 ; Amaral , 1987 -RRB- removal of cortical sensory areas does not interfere with the conditioning of fear responses to auditory stimuli -LRB- LeDoux et al. , 1984 -RRB- .
16|However , the amygdala also receives projections from acoustic processing areas in the posterior thalamus -LRB- Veening , 1978 ; Ottersen and Ben-Ari , 1979 ; Turner and Herkenham , 1981 ; Russchen , 1982 ; LeDoux et al. , 1984 , 1985 -RRB- and these projections mediate the establishment of conditioned fear responses to acoustic stimuli -LRB- Iwata et al. , 1986a ; LeDoux et al. , 1986b -RRB- .
16|Since the POM is not within the projection field ofthe inferior colliculus -LRB- LeDoux et al. , 1987 ; Farb et al. , 1988 -RRB- and thus can not be considered part of the acoustic thalamus , it appears unlikely that cells in this structure constitute the origin of the thalamo-amygdala projection that underlies the conditioning of fear responses to acoustic stimuli .
16|AL , therefore , may be the sensory interface of the amygdala in fear conditioning .
16|The electrode was lowered to the lateral amygdala without passing current for operated , unlesioned controls .
16|Typical bilateral lesions of the lateral nucleus of the amygdala are illustrated on drawings of frontal sections through the caudal -LRB- a -RRB- , intermediate -LRB- b -RRB- , and rostra1 -LRB- c -RRB- thirds of the amygdala .
16|The lesions completely destroy the lateral amygdala at the level where the stria terminalis forms the medial border of the central amygdaloid nucleus -LRB- level b -RRB- .
16|Results Experiment 1 Histological observations Bilateral lesions aimed at the lateral amygdala were made in 29 rats .
16|Specifically , if AL was completely destroyed bilaterally in the anterior-posterior center of the nucleus -LRB- the level at which the stria terminalis encapsulates the medial border of ACE -RRB- , the animal was included , provided that the lesion did not also invade the adjacent central nucleus of the amygdala .
16|Using these guidelines , 6 of the 29 animals were ultimately included in the lateral amygdala group .
16|The lesions were intentionally made slightly larger -LRB- by increasing the duration of current delivery from 10 to 15 set -RRB- , and lesions that spread to adjacent areas , such as the central nucleus of the amygdala , were accepted , as long as the lateral amygdala was completely damaged at the level where the stria terminalis extends along the medial border of the ACE .
16|Photomicrographs of representative lesions of the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- c -RRB- , caudate putamen just dorsal to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- b -RRB- , and cortex just lateral to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- 4 .
16|Efects of lateral amygdala lesions on conditioned emotional responses In the sham-lesioned control group -LRB- n = 6 -RRB- , the CS evoked stereotyped increases in mean arterial pressure and freezing behavior -LRB- Fig. 3 -RRB- , as we have typically observed -LRB- LeDoux et al. , 1984 , 1986b , 1988 ; Iwata et al. , 1986a -RRB- .
16|In contrast , the arterial pressure and freezing responses in animals with incomplete lesions of the lateral amygdala -LRB- n = 10 -RRB- and in animals with lesions which were accidentally placed ventral to AL -LRB- n = 3 -RRB- were similar to responses of the sham-lesioned control group -LRB- Fig. 4 -RRB- .
16|Bilateral lesions that only partially destroyed the lateral amygdala or that missed the lateral amygdala did not significantly reduce the arterial pressure or freezing responses .
16|Compare these findings with the effects of complete lesions of lateral amygdala , as shown in Figure 3 .
16|Lesions of the caudate-putamen just dorsal to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala or of the cortex just lateral to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala did not significantly affect the arterial pressure or freezing responses .
16|Efecls of lesions of the lateral amygdala on conditioned emotional responses Rats in the sham-lesioned group -LRB- n = 24 -RRB- exhibited freezing during most of the CS .
16|One of the efferent connections of the lateral amygdala is ACE -LRB- Krettek and Price , 1978b ; Roberts et al. , 1982 ; Amaral , 1987 -RRB- .
16|The arterial pressure and freezing responses evoked by the CS in animals with lateral amygdala lesions -LRB- AL-PAIR -RRB- are not different from those in sham operated animals given nonassociative -LRB- random -RRB- presentations of the CS and US @H - RAND -RRB- .
16|The performance of animals given random traning after lateral amygdala lesions -LRB- AL-RAND -RRB- is similar to that of animals given random traning after sham operation .
16|Thus , following lateral amygdala lesions rats perform as if they have been given random rather than paired presentations of the CS and US .
16|Also , since fibers originating in the thalamus and terminating in and near ACE enter the amygdala medially -LRB- LeDoux et al. , 1985 -RRB- it is unlikely 120 - 100 - 80 - G - E. .
16|In a second experiment , the effects oflateral amygdala lesions were reexamined .
16|As in the first experiment -LRB- see Fig. 3 -RRB- lesions ofthe lateral amygdala greatly reduced the duration of `` freezing '' in the presence of the CS -LRB- left -RRB- .
16|Also , the CS suppressed drinking behavior less in animals with lateral amygdala lesions , as indicated by the greater amount of time the lesioned animals spent drinking during the CS -LRB- right -RRB- .
16|Less freezing and more drinking during the CS both indicate that lateral amygdala lesions interfere with fear conditioning .
16|1068 LeDoux et al. - Lateral Amygdala and Fear Conditioning that AL lesions disrupted thalamic projections to the central amygdala and thereby interfered with fear conditioning .
16|Our working hypothesis , though , is that AL is the sensory interface of the amygdala and that lesions of this region interfere with aversive conditioning by blocking the synaptic transmission of the acoustic CS to the amygdala .
16|Our view that AL is the sensory interface of the amygdala is supported by the fact that the main afferents to this structure originate in sensory processing areas of the thalamus and cortex -LRB- Whitlock and Nauta , 1956 ; Herzog and van Hoesen , 1975 ; Aggleton et al. , 1980 ; Turner et al. , 1980 ; Russchen , 1982 ; LeDoux et al. , 1984 , 1985 , 1987 , 1990 ; Amaral , 1987 -RRB- .
16|Moreover , electrical stimulation of the acoustic thalamus , the region believed to be afferent to the lateral amygdala in the conditioning circuit , elicits short-latency excitatory action potentials in AL -LRB- LeDoux et al. , 1986a ; Clugnet et al. , 1990 -RRB- .
16|These observations , in light of the fact that the main afferents to AL arise in sensory processing areas -LRB- see above -RRB- , suggest that benzodiazepines may , in part , relieve fear and anxiety by gating sensory inputs to the amygdala or otherwise reducing the propensity of sensory stimuli to activate the emotional circuits organized through the amygdala .
16|Moreover , glutamate , one ofthe major excitatory transmitters in the brain and a major ligand for NMDA receptors , is present in the cells of origin of the thalamo-amygdala projection and in presynaptic terminals in AL -LRB- Farb et al. , 1989 -RRB- and blockade of excitatory amino acid receptors interferes with the excitation of AL neurons by MGB stimulation -LRB- Clugnet and LeDoux , 1989 -RRB- .
16|It appears to be the sensory gateway to the amygdala and may also be a site of emotional modulation and cellular plasticity .
2|Amphibians were thought to have evolved an ` archistriatum ' -LRB- archaic striatum -RRB- above the palaeostriatum , which was proposed to be the antecedent of the human amygdala .
2|The mammalian pallium includes the areas known as palaeocortex , archicortex and neocortex ; and has been said , more recently , to include both the claustrum and lateral parts of the amygdala28 ,41,42 -LRB- FIG. 1c ; Holmgren11 originally proposed that the claustrum and part of the amygdala were pallial , but this view was largely ignored at the time -RRB- .
2|An example of a nuclear-to-claustrum/amygdala nuclei hypothesis is shown in panel b .
2|We will consider these in two groups -- nuclear-to-layered hypotheses and nuclear-to-claustrum/amygdala nuclei hypotheses .
2|Nuclear-to-claustrum/amygdala hypotheses These hypotheses -LRB- BOX 2 -RRB- provide a different interpretation of mammalian homologies with the avian ventral hyperstriatum , neostriatum and archistriatum , known collectively as the dorsal ventricular ridge -LRB- DVR -RRB- .
2|In an early proposal , Bruce and Neary74 proposed that the avian DVR represents an elaboration of parts of the mammalian amygdala .
2|Subsequently , Striedter75 proposed that the avian DVR represents an elaboration of the mammalian amygdala and claustrum , and that the connectivity that the DVR shares with the neocortex evolved independently .
2|Support for this view was based on several facts : both the avian DVR and mammalian claustrum/amygdala are nuclear in organization75 ; both the avian DVR and part of the mammalian amygdala have similar connections74 ,76,77 ; and both have conserved developmental expression patterns of regulatory genes that have important roles in brain regionalization and morphogenesis28 ,68 .
2|In the most detailed gene expression study , Puelles et al. 28 proposed that the common topographic expression patterns of the transcription factors EMX1 and PAX6 in the avian hyperstriatum ventrale and in the mammalian dorsal claustrum and basolateral amygdala indicate that these structures both arose from the lateral pallium -LRB- BOX 2 -RRB- .
2|They argued that the absence of EMX1 but the presence of other pallial genes in the avian neostriatum and in the mammalian ventral claustrum and lateral anterior amygdala indicate that these structures commonly arose from the ventral pallium .
2|They further proposed that the avian archistriatum and mammalian amygdala consist of subpallial parts derived from striatal and pallidal cell groups , and , by this association , that the avian archistriatum is homologous to the mammalian amygdala , as originally proposed by Edinger1 .
2|In addition , not all findings support the nuclear-to-claustrum/amygdala hypothesis .
2|Although initial studies28 reported that this hypothesis was supported by the lack of pallial EMX1 expression in the avian neostriatum -LRB- so-called ventral pallium -RRB- and the mammalian ventral claustrum and lateral anterior amygdala , recent fate mapping showed that the ventral claustrum contains dispersed EMX1-expressing cells and the lateral amygdala contains many EMX1 - expressing cells79 .
2|We concluded that several neuronal populations adjacent to the arcopallium and the posterior part of what had been regarded as archistriatum are homologous to pallial and subpallial regions of the mammalian amygdala , and renamed them as members of the amygdaloid complex .
2|So , as for birds , it might be best to abandon the use of the terms archicortex , palaeocortex , archistriatum , palaeostriatum and neostriatum for mammals and other vertebrates in favour of the alternatives -- hippocampus or hippocampal cortex , piriform cortex , amygdala , striatum and pallidum .

20|However , dopamine excites most amygdala interneurons , suggesting that this dopaminergic gate may be mediated by an unknown subpopulation of interneurons .
20|Using transgenic mice that express GFP in GABAergic interneurons , we show that paracapsular cells form a network surrounding the basolateral complex of the amygdala .
20|We found that they provide feedforward inhibition into the basolateral and the central amygdala .
20|Introduction The amygdala plays a crucial role in producing emotionally appropriate behavior in response to sensory input , in particular to threatening stimuli -LRB- LeDoux , 2000 -RRB- .
20|For this process , an intact inhibitory system is essential as illustrated by the fact that selective blocking of inhibition -LRB- e.g. , by infusion of GABAA receptor blockers in the amygdala -RRB- produces an uncontrolled anxiety-like state -LRB- Sanders and Shekhar , 1995 -RRB- .
20|Previous findings indicate that cortical afferents drive inhibition in the amygdala by activating local interneurons -LRB- Lang and Pare , 1998 ; Le Gal LaSalle et al. , 1978 -RRB- , resulting in suppressed output from the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA , consisting of the lateral , basolateral , and basomedial nuclei -RRB- -LRB- Rosenkranz and Grace , 2002 -RRB- and the central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- -LRB- Quirk et al. , 2003 -RRB- .
20|However , in situations in which an emotional response is important , cortically mediated inhibition must be lifted to facilitate amygdala function .
20|Several lines of evidence suggest that the modulatory neurotransmitter dopamine -LRB- DA -RRB- may act as switch between the cortically controlled and the disinhibited states of the amygdala : -LRB- 1 -RRB- DA is increased under stress in the amygdala -LRB- Inglis and Moghaddam , 1999 ; Yokoyama et al. , 2005 -RRB- , thus available in emotionally charged situations ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- DAproduces disinhibition in theBLA -LRB- Grace and Rosenkranz , 2002 ; Rosenkranz and Grace , 1999 -RRB- ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- release of DA enhances amygdala-related behavior -LRB- Borowski and Kokkinidis , 1998 -RRB- , whereas inhibition of the dopaminergic system depresses amygdala-related behavior such as fear learning and the expression of fear -LRB- Greba and Kokkinidis , 2000 ; Lamont and Kokkinidis , 1998 ; Nader and LeDoux , 1999 -RRB- .
20|In particular DA D1 receptors appear to be essential for disinhibition of the amygdala , as prefrontal cortical control over the amygdala is strongly reduced through DA D1 receptor activation -LRB- Rosenkranz and Grace , 2002 -RRB- .
20|On a cellular level , disinhibition of the BLA can either result from reduced excitatory input to interneurons or from a direct suppression of amygdala interneuron excitability .
20|This raises the question as to whether a subpopulation of amygdala interneurons exists that is differently modulated by DA and mediates cortical control of the amygdala .
20|In the rat amygdala , the so-called paracapsular intercalated cells -LRB- pcs -RRB- -LRB- Alheid et al. , 1995 ; Millhouse , 1986 -RRB- receive the densest afferents from the mesencephalic DAergic system with a high number of somatic and perisomatic synapses and show the highest levels of DA D1 receptor immunoreactivity and DA D1 receptor mRNA -LRB- Asan , 1998 ; Fuxe et al. , 2003 -RRB- .
20|Given the occurrence of pcs along the fiber bundles carrying cortical afferents together with their dense dopaminergic innervation , wehypothesized that these cells are substantially involved in mediating the prominent cortical feedforward inhibition and its modulation by DA observed in the amygdala .
20|Here we demonstrate that pcs form an interconnected system provide feedforward inhibition into the BLA complex and the CeA and show a modulation by DA and DA D1 agonists that is not found in other neurons in the amygdala .
20|With help of these mice , two types of interneurons could be distinguished in the amygdala : `` classical '' interneurons that occur loosely scattered within the BLA and densely packed clusters of smaller interneurons that are located along the external capsule and along the medial border between the BLA and central amygdala -LRB- Figures 1A and 1C -RRB- .

20|DA Reduces Feedforward Inhibition into the BLA and CeA In the lateral nucleus of the amygdala , thalamically triggered feedforward inhibition is reduced in the presence of DA through activation of DA D2 receptors -LRB- Bissiere et al. , 2003 -RRB- .

20|D1 Receptor Activation Selectively Reduces pc Inhibitory Output To assess more accurately the contribution of the pc system to inhibitory signals in the amygdala , wemade use of their distinct DA D1 pharmacology .
20|Discussion In the present study , we have shown that lpcs strongly resemble mpcs in physiological and functional aspects , providing evidence that the collectivity of pcs constitutes a special network of amygdala interneurons .
20|In the presence of DA , the pc-mediated inhibition collapses , thus attenuating cortical control and most likely promoting amygdala-related behavior .
20|Cortical and in particular prefrontal cortical control over the amygdala is essential for appropriate affective response .
20|Recent fMRI data in humans have indicated that the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- shapes amygdala-dependent behavior -LRB- Hariri et al. , 2000 , 2003 -RRB- and also plays an important role in fear extinction -LRB- Phelps et al. , 2004 -RRB- .
20|Consequently , a disturbed interaction between the prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- and the amygdala is postulated to underlie the affective symptoms of psychiatric disorders such as depression -LRB- Siegle et al. , 2002 ; Soares and Mann , 1997 -RRB- and schizophrenia -LRB- Gur et al. , 2002 ; Perlstein et al. , 2003 ; Taylor et al. , 2002 -RRB- .
20|Dopaminergic Modulation of pcs Our finding that pcs are inhibited by DA via D1 receptors suggests a simple resolution to the paradoxical result that DA D1 receptor activation disinhibits the amygdala DA 0 -40 IPSC Amplitude -LRB- pA -RRB- 0 Time -LRB- min -RRB- 25 2 mV a 200 ms b c IPSP Amplitude -LRB- mV -RRB- EPSP Slope -LRB- mV/ms -RRB- 0 -5 5 0 Time -LRB- min -RRB- 20 a b c -50 -80 RMP -LRB- mV -RRB- mpc-cluster stimulation DA lpc-cluster stimulation rep. A D E F G 20 mV 20 pA 50 ms Failures -LRB- % -RRB- 100 0 IPSC Amp .
20|Consistent with prior investigations showing that DA D1 receptor signaling in the amygdala does not involve the classical cAMP-dependent pathways -LRB- Leonard et al. , 2003 ; Loretan et al. , 2004 -RRB- , DA D1 receptors on pcs couple to GIRK channels presumably by direct interaction of bg subunits with the GIRK1/GIRK4 channels -LRB- Huang et al. , 1995 -RRB- .
20|Based on our results obtained in vitro , focal injection of DA D1 agonists into the amygdala should be anxiogenic in vivo , while focal application of DA D1 antagonists should result in anxiolysis .
20|Unfortunately , DA D1 agonists have not been applied focally in behavioral tests for anxiety , but focal application of the DA D1 antagonist SCH 23390 onto mpcs in rats does indeed result in anxiolysis of the injected rats -LRB- de la Mora et al. , 2005 -RRB- , bolstering the importance of the pc system in controlling amygdala function in vivo .
20|Another behavioral paradigm that involves mPFC innervation and dopaminergic modulation is fear extinction , in which increased mPFC input leads to a suppression of amygdala function and fearrelated behavior -LRB- Phelps et al. , 2004 -RRB- .
20|Moreover , it was recently demonstrated that chronic stress , which likely increases dopamine levels in the amygdala -LRB- Inglis and Moghaddam , 1999 ; Yokoyama et al. , 2005 -RRB- , produces disinhibition in the CeA in vivo , similar to the effect achieved by severing mPFC afferents -LRB- Correll et al. , 2005 -RRB- .
20|In addition to cortical feedforward inhibition , the amygdala also receives afferent input and feedforward inhibition from the thalamus .
20|Interestingly , via activation of DA D2 receptors on LA interneurons , DA depresses thalamic feedforward inhibition and thereby facilitates the induction of long-term potentiation in the lateral amygdala -LRB- Bissiere et al. , 2003 -RRB- .
20|Given the interneuron-specific DAergic effects , the spatio-temporal characteristics of DA release allow for a flexible control of amygdala signaling .
20|Low activity levels of the DAergic afferents in the amygdala will preferentially depress the output of pcs due to their dense somatic DAergic innervation .
20|Again , low levels of DA release would predominantly activate DA D1 receptors , inhibit the pc system , and facilitate amygdala function , whereas stronger activation would also activate DA D2 receptors and allow for synaptic plasticity .
20|Doubleimmunofluorescence staining was performedwith antibodies against GFP , against classical markers of interneurons in the amygdala -LRB- parvalbumin , calbindin , NPY , somatostatin , CCK -RRB- , and against tyrosine hydroxylase -LRB- 1:10 ' 000 ; Diasorin , Stillwater , Minnesota -RRB- as described -LRB- Zeilhofer et al. , 2005 -RRB- , using secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa 488 and Cy3 .
20|Therefore , TH-positive axons in the amygdala likely represent dopaminergic projections .
22|Stereological Analysis of the Rat and Monkey Amygdala Loïc J. Chareyron1 , Pamela Banta Lavenex1 , David G. Amaral2 , and Pierre Lavenex1 , * 1Laboratory of Brain and Cognitive Development , Department of Medicine , University of Fribourg , Switzerland 2Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences , Center for Neuroscience , California National Primate Research Center and the M.I.N.D. Institute , UC Davis , Davis , California , USA Abstract The amygdala is part of a neural network that contributes to the regulation of emotional behaviors .
22|Rodents , especially rats , are used extensively as model organisms to decipher the functions of specific amygdala nuclei , in particular in relation to fear and emotional learning .
22|Analysis of the role of the nonhuman primate amygdala in these functions has lagged work in the rodent but provides evidence for conservation of basic functions across species .
22|Here we provide quantitative information regarding the morphological characteristics of the main amygdala nuclei in rats and monkeys , including neuron and glial cell numbers , neuronal soma size , and individual nuclei volumes .
22|INDEXING TERMS amygdaloid complex ; neuron ; astrocyte ; oligodendrocyte ; neuropil ; human The amygdala , also known as the amygdaloid complex , is a brain region located in the rostral portion of the human medial temporal lobe -LRB- Freese and Amaral , 2009 -RRB- .
22|In rodents and primates including humans the amygdala consists of 13 nuclei and cortical areas demarcated into several subdivisions -LRB- Table 1 -RRB- -LRB- Amaral et al. , 1992 ; Sorvari et al. , 1996 ; Pitkäen , 2000 -RRB- .
22|The amygdala has also been linked to the neural systems that underlie normal social behavior -LRB- Adolphs , 2003 -RRB- , essentially via the modulation of fear -LRB- Emery et al. , 2001 ; Prather et al. , 2001 ; Amaral et al. , 2003 ; Bauman et al. , 2004 -RRB- .
22|In addition , the amygdala has been shown to be important for the modulation of memory processes , particularly under arousing or emotionally salient conditions -LRB- McGaugh , 2004 ; Roozendaal et al. , 2009 -RRB- .
22|Rodents , especially rats , are used extensively as model organisms to study the structural organization of the amygdala and to decipher the functions of specific amygdala nuclei -LRB- Pitkänen et al. , 1997 ; Balleine and Killcross , 2006 -RRB- , in particular with respect to fear and emotional learning -LRB- Sigurdsson et al. , 2007 -RRB- .
22|In contrast , primates have been the model of choice for studies of the role of the amygdala in social behavior -LRB- Amaral et al. , 2003 ; Adolphs , 2010 -RRB- .
22|Similarly , a relatively comprehensive description of the fundamental morphological characteristics and connectivity of the amygdaloid complex in rats , cats , and monkeys -LRB- Price et al. , 1987 -RRB- also summarized and suggested a number of potentially important species differences.Stephan and Andy -LRB- 1977 -RRB- performed an informative comparative study of the volume of the amygdala in a large number of species .
22|However , there was only limited information regarding the connectivity and neurochemical characteristics of the amygdaloid complex at that time and the nomenclature used in that study did not correspond to our current understanding of the structural organization of the amygdala -LRB- Table 1 -RRB- -LRB- Amaral et al. , 1992 ; Sorvari et al. , 1996 ; Pitkänen , 2000 -RRB- .
22|Although a cursory examination of Nissl-stained , coronal brain sections is sufficient to recognize that the amygdala differs between rodents and primates , little reliable quantitative information defining the number of neurons and glial cells , neuronal soma size , and individual nuclei volumes exists .
22|We therefore implemented modern , design-based stereological techniques to count neuron and glia numbers , measure neuronal soma size and the volume of the main amygdala nuclei -LRB- lateral , basal , paralaminar -LRB- in monkeys -RRB- , accessory basal , medial and central nuclei -RRB- in mature rats -LRB- at 7 months of age -RRB- and monkeys -LRB- at 5 -- 9 years of age -RRB- .
22|We further compared our quantitative data with previously acquired stereological data from the human amygdala -LRB- Schumann and Amaral , 2005 -RRB- , in order to provide a critical perspective on the relative development and structural organization of the main amygdala nuclei in two model organisms widely used to decipher the basic principles of amygdala functions in humans .
22|Anatomical boundaries of the amygdala Rats -- The cytoarchitectonic organization of the rat amygdala has been described in detail previously -LRB- Krettek and Price , 1978 ; McDonald , 1982 ; Cassell et al. , 1986 ; Price et al. , 1987 ; Pitkänen et al. , 1995 ; Savander et al. , 1995 , 1996 ; Jolkkonen and Pitkäen , 1998 -RRB- , and a nomenclature congruent with that used for monkeys and humans has been provided by Pitkänen -LRB- 2000 -RRB- for defining the rat amygdala nuclei -LRB- Table 1 -RRB- .
22|We thus delineated the five main nuclei of the rat amygdala -LRB- i.e. , lateral , basal , accessory basal , central , and medial -RRB- according to these descriptions for all subsequent analyses -LRB- Fig. 1 -RRB- .
22|Monkeys -- The nomenclature and the basic description of the morphological characteristics of the amygdala nuclei have been described in detail previously by Price et al. -LRB- 1987 -RRB- , Amaral et al. -LRB- 1992 -RRB- , and Pitkänen and Amaral -LRB- 1998 -RRB- for the cynomolgus monkey -LRB- Macaca fascicularis -RRB- .
22|We used these descriptions to determine the boundaries of the six main nuclei -LRB- i.e. , lateral , basal , accessory basal , paralaminar , central , and medial -RRB- of the Macaca mulatta amygdala -LRB- Table 1 ; Fig. 2 -RRB- .
22|We estimated the volume of the brain -LRB- telencephalon and diencephalon -RRB- , the volume of the whole amygdala , the volume of the main amygdala nuclei -LRB- lateral , basal , paralaminar -LRB- in monkeys -RRB- , accessory basal , central , and medial -RRB- according to the Cavalieri principle on Nissl-stained sections cut at 60 ?m in monkeys and 40 ?m in rats -LRB- Gundersen and Jensen , 1987 ; West and Gundersen , 1990 ; Lavenex et al. , 2000a , b -RRB- .
22|An average of 15 sections per animal for monkeys -LRB- 480 ?m apart -RRB- and an average of 28 sections per animal for rats -LRB- 160 ?m apart -RRB- were used to measure the volume of the whole amygdala .
22|We estimated total amygdala volumes in the left and the right hemisphere and did not find any lateralization in rats -LRB- t -LRB- 3 -RRB- = ? 0.606 , P = 0.587 -RRB- or in monkeys -LRB- t -LRB- 3 -RRB- = ? 1.222 , P = 0.309 -RRB- .
22|About 29 sections per animal for monkeys -LRB- 240 ?m apart -RRB- and about 21 sections per animal for rats -LRB- 160 ?m apart -RRB- were used for volume measurements of the main amygdala nuclei .
22|As there was no lateralization for overall amygdala size , we estimated the volumes of individual amygdala nuclei in the left hemisphere for half of the animals , and in the right hemisphere for the other half .
22|As for brain volume measurements , we used the section cutting thickness -LRB- 60 ?m in monkeys , 40 ?m in rats -RRB- in order to calculate the volume of individual amygdala nuclei .
22|Neuron number was estimated in the right or in the left amygdala only , as for volume measurements .
22|Estimates of cell size might therefore be impacted by the nonrandom orientation of neurons in the different amygdala nuclei , which could lead to a systematic over - or underestimation of cell size in any given structure .
22|The total number of glial cells in the amygdala nuclei was determined using the optical fractionator method during the neuron counting .
22|Thus , our findings and all subsequent considerations are valid for , and can be generalized to , both left and right amygdala in both males and females .
22|3D reconstructions We performed 3D reconstructions of the amygdala nuclei in order to better appreciate the morphological and topological differences between rats , monkeys and humans -LRB- Fig. 4 ; Supporting Information 2 and 3 -RRB- .
22|We used every Nissl-stained , coronal brain section , 160 ?m apart for rats , 240 ?m apart for monkeys to trace the main amygdala nuclei with StereoInvestigator 7.0 .
22|Tracings of the human amygdala nuclei were obtained with StereoInvestigator 5.0 -LRB- Schumann and Amaral , 2005 -RRB- .
22|The software generated a surface reconstruction of the brain and main amygdala nuclei using the Boissonnat -LRB- 1988 -RRB- method .
22|RESULTS Volumes We used the Cavalieri method to estimate the volumes of the brain , the whole amygdala , and the main amygdala nuclei in rats and monkeys -LRB- Table 2 -RRB- .
22|In comparison , the volume of the whole amygdala -LRB- unilaterally -RRB- was only 18 times larger in monkeys than in rats .
22|Importantly , this size difference was not homogeneous among amygdala nuclei , and distinct amygdala nuclei exhibited different scaling factors between rats and monkeys -LRB- Table 2 ; Fig. 5A -RRB- .
22|The combined volume of the remaining amygdala nuclei -LRB- i.e. , nuclei other than those described above -RRB- was 10 times larger in monkeys than in rats -LRB- see Table 2 -RRB- .
22|By way of comparison , the human brain is ? 10 times larger than the monkey brain and the human amygdala is 7 times larger than that of the monkey .
22|The combined volume of the remaining amygdala nuclei was 6 times larger in humans than in monkeys .
22|Altogether , these volumetric data revealed important species differences in the relative size of the main amygdala nuclei in rats , monkeys , and humans .
22|Indeed , the summed volume of the lateral , basal -LRB- including the paralaminar nucleus in monkeys and humans -RRB- , and accessory basal nuclei represented 62 % of total amygdala volume in monkeys and 69 % in humans , whereas it represented only 28 % of total amygdala volume in rats .
22|These differences can easily be appreciated in 3D reconstructions of the amygdala in the three species -LRB- Fig. 4 and Supporting Information 2 and 3 -RRB- .
22|Neuron and glial cell numbers We used the optical fractionator method to estimate the number of neurons and glial cells -LRB- astrocytes and oligodendrocytes -RRB- in distinct nuclei of the rat and monkey amygdala -LRB- Table 3 -RRB- , and compared our results with the number of neurons found in the human amygdala -LRB- Schumann and Amaral , 2005 -RRB- .
22|Consequently , the ratio between the number of glial cells and the number of neurons was about two times greater in monkeys than in rats ; this ratio was relatively constant across all amygdala nuclei -LRB- Table 3 -RRB- .
22|No data were available for the human amygdala .
22|Neuronal soma size We used the nucleator technique to estimate the volume of neuronal somas in the amygdala nuclei of rats and monkeys ; Schumann and Amaral -LRB- 2006 -RRB- estimated neuronal somas in human cases with the same method -LRB- Table 4 -RRB- .
22|Altogether , these data indicate that the average size of amygdala neurons is progressively larger from rats to monkeys to humans .
22|Across the main amygdala nuclei , neuronal somas were about two times larger in monkeys than in rats and about two times larger in humans than in monkeys -LRB- Table 4 ; Fig. 5C -RRB- .
22|In rats and monkeys , neurons exhibited distinct size distributions in different amygdala nuclei -LRB- Fig. 6 -RRB- .
22|In general , amygdala neuron populations were more heterogeneous in monkeys than in rats , suggesting a potentially greater diversity of different cell types in primates .
22|We therefore calculated neuron density for the main amygdala nuclei -LRB- Table 4 ; Fig. 5D -RRB- , based on our previous measures of volumes and neuron numbers -LRB- Tables 2 , 3 -RRB- .
22|We therefore calculated the percentage of the volume occupied by neuronal somas in order to obtain an estimate of neuropil volume in individual amygdala nuclei -LRB- Table 4 -RRB- .
22|On average , neuronal somas occupied ? 10 % of the volume of the amygdala in rats and ? 6 % in monkeys -LRB- Fig. 5E -RRB- .
22|Using data from Schumann and Amaral -LRB- 2005 , 2006 -RRB- , we estimated that the volume occupied by neuronal somas is ? 3 % in the human amygdala .
22|Interestingly , the percentage of the volume of individual amygdala nuclei occupied by neuronal somas was inversely related to the size of the neuronal somas -LRB- Fig. 5C , E -RRB- .
22|Indeed , the percentage of amygdala volume occupied by the neuropil was progressively larger from rats -LRB- 90 % -RRB- , to monkeys -LRB- 94 % -RRB- , to humans -LRB- 97 % -RRB- .
22|In addition , neuron density in the different amygdala nuclei across the three different species was inversely related to the volume of neuronal somas -LRB- Fig. 7 ; log10 -LRB- neuron density -RRB- = 10.116 -- 1.745 × log10 -LRB- soma size -RRB- ; R2 = 0.85 ; F -LRB- 1.59 -RRB- = 342.444 ; P < 0.001 -RRB- .
22|Altogether , these results suggest that species differences in neuropil volume are likely due to differences in the dendritic and axonal arborizations of amygdala neurons , which might reflect an increased level of connectivity in primates .
22|DISCUSSION Our stereological data in rats and monkeys provide fundamental , quantitative information regarding the morphological characteristics of the main amygdala nuclei in two species used as model organisms to understand the basic principles of human amygdala functions .
22|We found : 1 -RRB- that the lateral , basal , and accessory basal nuclei were dramatically more developed in monkeys than in rats , whereas the volume and neuron numbers in the central and medial nuclei differed far less between rats and monkeys ; 2 -RRB- a larger volume of the amygdala is made up of neuropil in monkeys than in rats .
22|We then evaluate our results in light of previous studies and conclude that our data provide a reliable reference regarding the morphological characteristics of the main amygdala nuclei in rats and monkeys .
22|It is quite possible that different rearing conditions and life experiences might have influenced the development of the amygdala -LRB- Joseph , 1999 ; Okuda et al. , 2009 -RRB- .
22|However , the relatively small variations that might be induced by rearing conditions are very unlikely to account for the major differences in the morphological features , such as main amygdala nuclei volumes and neuron and glial cell numbers , observed between species .
22|Moreover , the rearing conditions described here correspond to those typically employed in functional studies of the amygdala in rats -LRB- Pitkänen et al. , 1997 ; LeDoux , 2000 ; Balleine and Killcross , 2006 ; Sigurdsson et al. , 2007 -RRB- and monkeys -LRB- Emery et al. , 2001 ; Prather et al. , 2001 ; Amaral et al. , 2003 ; Bauman et al. , 2004 -RRB- .
22|However , this issue is unlikely to affect the conclusions of our study , as we focused our comparisons on the relative rather than absolute volumes of the different amygdala nuclei in the different species .
22|Thus , the comparison of total neuron numbers in the main amygdala nuclei of rats and monkeys is valid and reliable .
22|For example , it would be easy to conclude that the amygdala is less developed in monkeys , as compared to rats , if one defines the size of the amygdala in relation to the size of the brain .
22|This conclusion is obviously incorrect considering that 1 -RRB- the actual volume and the numbers of neurons and glial cells are indeed greater in the monkey amygdala , as compared to rats ; and 2 -RRB- we do not know what factors might impact the development of the rest of the brain in different species .
22|Comparison with previous studies Rats -- Previous studies of neuron number and nuclei volume in the rat amygdala have reported variable results -LRB- Supporting Information 4 -RRB- .
22|Data from two separate studies , which considered the volume and neuron number of at least three of the main amygdala nuclei -LRB- Tuunanen and Pitkänen , 2000 ; Pêgo et al. , 2008 -RRB- , differed significantly from each other but in a consistent manner as compared to our own results in the six main amygdala nuclei .
22|Altogether , the consistency of our results with those of a number of studies performed in different laboratories , together with the reliability of our stereological analysis system established in the monkey amygdala -LRB- see below -RRB- and hippocampal formation -LRB- Jabès et al. , 2010 , 2011 -RRB- , support the reliability of our stereological data on the volumes and neuron numbers in the main nuclei of the rat amygdala .
22|Our data can therefore be considered a reliable base on which to build models and perform interspecies comparisons of amygdala structure and putative functional circuits .
22|Monkeys -- Our results on nuclei volume and neuron number in the monkey amygdala are consistent with recent data reported by Carlo et al. -LRB- 2010 -RRB- -LRB- Supporting Information 4 -RRB- .
22|Since these differences are relatively small , they do not significantly impact the comparisons with the rat or human amygdala .
22|To our knowledge , there are no other data on neuron size and glia number in the rhesus monkey amygdala .
22|Humans -- The stereological data on the human amygdala reported by Schumann and Amaral -LRB- 2005 -RRB- were also supported by those of another study , which found similar results in the lateral nucleus of the human amygdala -LRB- Kreczmanski et al. , 2007 -RRB- -LRB- Supporting Information 4 -RRB- .
22|Despite differences in the delimitation of individual nuclei , Vereecken et al. -LRB- 1994 -RRB- found a total number of neurons in the whole amygdala that was close to that found by Schumann and Amaral -LRB- 2005 -RRB- .
22|Cell density and glia/neuron ratio Our data suggested that the greater glia/neuron ratio in the primate amygdala -LRB- i.e. , in both monkeys and humans -RRB- is mainly due to a lower density of neurons in primates as compared to rats .
22|The amygdala glia/neuron ratio -LRB- total number of glia divided by the total number of neurons -RRB- is greater in humans -LRB- 5.36 , derived from the data on glia density published by Hamidi et al. -LRB- 2004 -RRB- and the volume measurements of Schumann and Amaral -LRB- 2005 -RRB- -RRB- than in monkeys -LRB- 1.50 -RRB- or rats -LRB- 0.68 -RRB- .
22|In the human amygdala , Hamidi et al. -LRB- 2004 -RRB- estimated a glia density -LRB- oligodendrocytes + astrocytes ; 50,254 cells/mm3 -RRB- that is close to what we calculated in the monkey amygdala -LRB- 53,591 cells/mm3 -RRB- .
22|The glia/neuron ratio that we determined in the monkey amygdala -LRB- 1.50 -RRB- was much higher than previous estimates of glia/neuron ratio -LRB- including microglia -RRB- from several other regions of the Macaca mulatta rhesus monkeys brain .
22|As glia density is relatively constant across the brain , the higher glia/neuron ratio observed in the amygdala is more likely linked to a lower neuron density -LRB- 34,000 neurons/mm3 -RRB- as compared to neocortical areas -LRB- prefrontal cortex : 38,569 -- 58,708 neurons/mm3 -LRB- Dombrowski et al. , 2001 -RRB- ; visual cortex : 120,000 neurons/mm3 -LRB- OKusky and Colonnier , 1982 -RRB- -RRB- .
22|Similarly , neuron density in the human amygdala -LRB- 9,000 neurons/mm3 -RRB- appears to be markedly lower than neuron density in the human posterior orbitofrontal -LRB- area 13 ; 30,000 neurons/mm3 -RRB- -LRB- Semendeferi et al. , 1998 -RRB- and prefrontal -LRB- area 10 ; 34,000 neurons/mm3 -RRB- -LRB- Semendeferi et al. , 2001 -RRB- cortices .
22|The low neuron density of the amygdala , as compared to neocortical areas , could reflect a higher degree of intrinsic and extrinsic interconnectivity , and thus the functional specificity of this structure .
22|Neuropil The lower neuronal density in the primate amygdala , as compared to rodents , is related to a larger neuropil volume , which is likely associated with greater complexity in the dendritic and axonal arborizations of individual amygdala neurons .
22|This likely suggests that primates have a greater capacity to integrate information in specific amygdala circuits than do rats .
22|In the rat amygdala , dendrites and axons represent more than 80 % of the neuropil volume , glial cells 14 % and synapses only 2 % -LRB- Cooke et al. , 2007 -RRB- .
22|Accordingly , the complexity of the dendritic arborization of amygdala neurons is greater in monkeys than in rats -LRB- Rai et al. , 2005 ; Mohandas Rao et al. , 2009 -RRB- .
22|Indeed , assumption-based 2D Scholl analyses of amygdala neurons reported between 22 and 29 intersections -LRB- between dendrites and the concentric analysis circles centered on the soma -RRB- for neurons randomly selected in the rat amygdala -LRB- Rai et al. , 2005 ; Mohandas Rao et al. , 2009 -RRB- , and between 125 to 210 dendritic intersections for neurons randomly selected in the monkey amygdala -LRB- Herzog , 1982 ; see Altemus et al. , 2005 for data on the dendritic arborization of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 field of the rat and monkey hippocampus -RRB- .
22|Taken together , these results suggest a greater complexity of amygdala networks that might contribute to a greater integration of inputs reaching the amygdala in primates .
22|This hypothesis is supported by the higher convergence of information through the cascade of intrinsic amygdala circuits .
22|Input convergence and integration of information in amygdala circuits One obvious interpretation of our data is that the differences in the relative size and neuron numbers of the main amygdala nuclei observed between rats and monkeys are linked to their degree of connectivity with other brain structures .
22|As discussed above , the larger neuropil and greater neuronal soma size observed in the primate amygdala is associated with a greater complexity of the dendritic and local axonal arborizations , which could subsequently have a direct impact on the integration capacity of the functional network that includes this brain region .
22|Here we consider the major connections of the main amygdala nuclei -LRB- Freese and Amaral , 2009 -RRB- , in rats and monkeys -LRB- the connectivity of the human amygdala remains largely unknown -RRB- , in order to evaluate the hypothesis of a higher convergence and integration of information in the primate amygdala .
22|As discussed above , the relative development of the main amygdala nuclei might be influenced by their interconnections with other brain structures , i.e. , their afferent and efferent connections -LRB- Stephan et al. , 1987 -RRB- .
22|In rats and monkeys the lateral , basal , and accessory basal nuclei are the main recipients and originators of neocortical-amygdala connections -LRB- Pitkänen , 2000 ; Freese and Amaral , 2009 -RRB- .
22|Cortical projections to the amygdala are organized similarly in rats and monkeys -LRB- McDonald , 1998 -RRB- but these connections are far more substantial in monkeys than in rats due to the dramatic expansion of the neocortex in primates -LRB- Super and Uylings , 2001 -RRB- .
22|Similarly , the efferent projections from the amygdala to the neocortex are more substantial in primates .
22|For example , the amygdala projects to primary sensory areas in monkeys -LRB- Amaral and Price , 1984 ; Iwai and Yukie , 1987 ; Amaral et al. , 1992 ; Yukie , 2002 -RRB- and in humans -LRB- Catani et al. , 2003 -RRB- , but these connections are apparently absent in rats -LRB- Krettek and Price , 1977 -RRB- .
22|Consequently , and in contrast to rodents , the primate amygdala could influence the sensory processing at primary cortical stages -LRB- Freese and Amaral , 2009 -RRB- .
22|The expansion of cortical areas and the greater complexity of cortical information reaching the amygdala are thus associated with a greater development of the amygdala nuclei interconnected with the neocortex .
22|The main amygdala nuclei , including the lateral , basal , accessory basal , central , and medial nuclei , are also characterized by their unique intraamygdala connections -LRB- see Freese and Amaral , 2009 , for a comprehensive description -RRB- .
22|Within the amygdala circuitry , the connections between these different nuclei are highly unidirectional .
22|Finally , the central nucleus is the site of convergence of projections originating in all the other main amygdala nuclei .
22|Interestingly , we found the largest species differences in neuron numbers at the earliest stages of the intrinsic amygdala circuitry , that is , within the lateral , basal , and accessory basal nuclei .
22|Although fundamental amygdala functions are likely conserved across species , the relative importance of the functional processes carried out by distinct amygdalar circuits might differ between rodents and primates .
22|Cortical information reaching the primate amygdala via the lateral , basal , and accessory basal nuclei can be processed within these nuclei and sent back to the neocortex to modulate cortical activity and cognitive processes .
22|Intrinsic amygdala projections can further process these inputs and forward highly integrated information in order to influence the function of the central nucleus .
22|In sum , the basic functions carried out by the amygdala are likely conserved between species , even though the processes carried out by the central and medial nuclei might be under greater influence by cortical inputs in primates , via projections from the lateral , basal , and accessory basal nuclei .
22|Thus , to illustrate the functional impact of these morphometric differences between species , let us consider that the amygdala serves essentially as a danger detector , in both rodents and primates , thus facilitating the survival of the individual animal .
22|Although this survival function is essentially conserved in primates , because the primate amygdala can integrate additional contextual information , this additional information can further lead to the regulation of more complex behaviors such as the modulation of social interactions -LRB- Amaral et al. , 2003 -RRB- .
22|Going one step farther , as in the case of the human , where integration may be even greater , the amygdala is also activated when subjects are presented with untrustworthy faces -LRB- Adolphs et al. , 1998 ; Winston et al. , 2002 -RRB- , positive words -LRB- Hamann and Mao , 2002 -RRB- , happy faces -LRB- Canli et al. , 2002 -RRB- , amusement-inducing movies -LRB- Aalto et al. , 2002 -RRB- , and other complex social stimuli that might not have an equivalent in rodents .
22|Thus , the highly developed lateral nucleus of the monkey and human amygdala has greater computational resources to carry out learning and template matching for a wide range of environmental stimuli .
22|CONCLUSION This quantitative study has revealed important differences in the structural organization and cellular components of the main amygdala nuclei in rats , monkeys , and humans .
22|First , the primate amygdala is characterized by a lower neuron density , larger neuropil volume , and greater glia/neuron ratio than the rat amygdala .
22|These fundamental differences in the structural organization of the amygdala could be linked to a greater complexity and integration capacity of sensory information within the intrinsic amygdala circuits in primates .
22|This suggests that although the fundamental function of the amygdala , to regulate fear and emotional learning , is conserved across species , amygdala function might be under greater influence of cortical activity in primates , and therefore integrate additional contextual information that influences the regulation of more complex behaviors such as social interactions .
23|Behavioral/Systems/Cognitive Double Dissociation of Basolateral and Central Amygdala Lesions on the General and Outcome-Specific Forms of Pavlovian-Instrumental Transfer Laura H. Corbit and Bernard W. Balleine Department of Psychology and the Brain Research Institute , University of California , Los Angeles , Los Angeles , California 90095 This series of experiments compared the effects of lesions of the basolateral complex -LRB- BLA -RRB- and the central nucleus -LRB- CN -RRB- of the amygdala on a number of tests of instrumental learning and performance and particularly on the contribution of these structures to the specific and general forms of pavlovian-instrumental transfer -LRB- PIT -RRB- .
23|For example , recent studies have established that the influence of reward and signals that predict reward depends on the amygdala .
23|Nevertheless , there has been some disagreement on the locus of this influence within the amygdala itself .
23|Balleine et al. -LRB- 2003 -RRB- reported evidence that lesions of the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- abolish the sensitivity of instrumental performance to changes in the value of the instrumental outcome using a selective devaluation protocol .
23|In contrast , both Hall et al. -LRB- 2001 -RRB- and Holland and Gallagher -LRB- 2003 -RRB- reported that lesions of the BLA had no effect on PIT but , rather , that it was lesions of the amygdala central nucleus -LRB- CN -RRB- that were effective in eliminating this effect .
23|The brains were stored in 10 % formalin solution for at least 48 h and then transferred to a 25 % sucrose -- formalin solution before 40 m coronal sections were cut throughout the region of the amygdala .

23|Data and resultant theories can be found to support both of these processes -LRB- Rescorla and Solomon , 1967 ; Trapold and Overmier , 1972 ; Overmier and Lawry , 1979 ; Colwill and Motzkin , 1994 ; Corbit and Balleine , 2003 -RRB- , and lesions of the amygdala could affect either or both of them .
23|Hence , this study provides evidence that the specific and the general forms of PIT can be doubly dissociated at the level of the amygdala .
23|The role of the amygdala in instrumental conditioning The current series of experiments found that lesions of the BLA eliminate the selective excitatory effect of reward-related stimuli on instrumental responding but left the acquisition of pavlovian and instrumental conditioning otherwise intact .
23|Generally , therefore , this dissociation between the general excitatory effects and the more specific cuing functions of reward-related stimuli in instrumental conditioning may help reconcile not only the inconsistencies in previous reports of amygdala lesions but also those involving lesions of the nucleus accumbens and specifically the distinct functions associated with the core and shell subregions of that structure .

Quirk , J. Christopher Repa , and Joseph E. LeDoux Center for Neural Science New York University New York , New York 10003 Summary The lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is the first site in the amygdala where the plasticity underlying fear conditioning could occur .
26|A large and growing body of evidence points to the amygdala as a critical structure in the neural system that mediates fear conditioning -LRB- Davis , 1992 ; Kapp et al. , 1992 ; Fanselow , 1994 ; LeDoux , 1995 -RRB- .
26|This work suggests that the amygdala is situated between sensory systems involved in processing the conditioned fear stimulus and motor regions involved in controlling the conditioned fear responses .
26|Although it is widely assumed that the amygdala is crucially involved in fear conditioning , mechanisms of neural plasticity within the amygdala that account for conditioned fear learning are not well understood .
26|Our approach to understanding amygdala plasticity has been to identify the anatomical circuits through which information about an acoustic CS flows into and through the amygdala in rats .
26|The lateral nucleus -LRB- LA -RRB- is known to be the sensory-receptive region of the amygdala -LRB- LeDoux , 1992 -RRB- .
26|LA is also a site of convergence of pathways transmitting the auditory CS and the somatosensory US -LRB- Romanski et al. , 1993 -RRB- and is the region of the amygdala with the shortest response latency to acoustic stimuli -LRB- Bordi and LeDoux , 1992 -RRB- .
26|Information received by LA is then transmitted , over intra-amygdala pathways , to several additional nuclei -LRB- Price et al. , 1987 ; Stefanacci et al. , 1992 ; Pitkanen et al. , 1995 -RRB- .
26|Given the pivotal role of LA as the sensory interface of the amygdala , it thus seems important to determine whether plasticity occurs in this region during fear conditioning .
26|Most of the previous studies recording unit activity during fear conditioning have focused on the central -LRB- Applegate et al. , 1982 ; Pascoe and Kapp , 1985 ; Muramoto et al. , 1993 -RRB- and basolateral -LRB- Maren et al. , 1991 ; Muramoto et al. , 1993 -RRB- nuclei of the amygdala .
26|Additionally , LAv , especially the medial part , gives rise to a more extensive set of intra-amygdala connections than LAd -LRB- Pitkanen et al. , 1995 -RRB- .
26|We analyzed the responses of neurons in LAd and LAv separately , but were especially interested in the plasticity of neurons in LAd , the first locus of sensory processing in the amygdala .
26|AB , accessory basal nucleus of the amygdala ; B , basolateral nucleus of the amygdala ; CE , central nucleus of the amygdala ; CPU , caudate !
26|Discussion A large and growing body of evidence has implicated the amygdala in fear conditioning -LRB- Davis , 1992 ; Kapp et al. , 1992 ; Fanselow , 1994 ; LeDoux , 1995 -RRB- .
26|Because LA is the region through which sensory inputs enter into amygdala circuitries , and the first opportunity for processing of a conditioned stimulus in the amygdala , we examined whether neurons in LA are modified during fear conditioning .
26|Our results showing that LAd neurons are also modified as a result of conditioning add significantly to the literature by demonstrating that plasticity is present at the earliest stage of amygdala processing .
26|These investigators found a higher percentage of sensory-responsive cells in the amygdala -LRB- as a whole -RRB- in conditioned rats compared with naive rats .
26|The majority of multimodal neuronal responses were found in the basolateral and central nuclei , and they conclude that these structures are the earliest sites of sensory Lateral Amygdala Plasticity during Fear Conditioning 1035 convergence -LRB- and plasticity -RRB- in the amygdala .
26|While similar changes occur in other amygdala regions , the fact that they occur in LA -LRB- particularly in LAd -RRB- is notable , as this is the site at which sensory information enters the amygdala during conditioning and the first possible locus where plasticity could occur in the amygdala .
26|Plasticity of neuronal tone responses of the type described here was predicted in a recent network model of amygdala units during fear conditioning -LRB- Armony et al. , 1995 -RRB- and by studies showing that auditory responses in LAd are enhanced by induction of long-term potentiation in the pathway that transmits auditory inputs to LA -LRB- Rogan and LeDoux , 1995 -RRB- .
26|Latency of Conditioned Responses Given that sensory inputs enter the amygdala in LAd and that LAv receives at least some information about sensory stimuli from LAd -LRB- Pitkanen et al. , 1995 -RRB- , it is reasonable to expect that conditioning-induced changes following tone onset would occur earlier in LAd than in LAv .
26|The conditioning latencies we found in LAd are considerably shorter than those previously reported in the amygdala .
26|This suggests that the minimum latency for cortical activation of the amygdala should be greater than 20 ms. Thus , it is likely that more than half of the conditioned responses we observed are too early to be mediated via a cortical relay and more likely reflect the enhancement of thalamic inputs .
26|These data support the hypothesis that direct transmission of auditory stimuli from the auditory thalamus to the amygdala contributes importantly to behavioral responses to threatening acoustic events -LRB- LeDoux , 1995 -RRB- and challenge the notion that only cortico-amygdala pathways are used -LRB- Campeau and Davis , 1995 -RRB- .
26|In addition to the amygdala , conditioned unit responses have been observed in the medial division of the medial geniculate nucleus -LRB- MGm -RRB- -LRB- Disterhoft and Stuart , 1976 ; Gabriel et al. , 1976 ; Ryugo and Weinberger , 1978 ; Edeline and Weinberger , 1992 -RRB- and auditory cortex -LRB- Disterhoft and Stuart , 1976 ; Kraus and Disterhoft , 1982 ; Weinberger et al. , 1984 ; Bakin and Weinberger , 1990 ; Maho et al. , 1995 -RRB- .
26|Early increases in tone responses in LA neurons are transmitted through intraamygdala circuits to the central nucleus , which then directly controls autonomic and behavioral responses via projections to the brain stem -LRB- see Davis , 1992 ; Kapp et al. , 1992 ; LeDoux , 1995 -RRB- without necessarily requiring cortical processing -LRB- LeDoux , 1995 -RRB- .
26|The changes we observed in functional connectivity between LA neurons suggest that , once learned , stimulus-fear associations may be stored in the amygdala , where they are in a position to continually modulate the sensory input stream .

29|Here we show in rats that extinction is associated with increased levels of synaptic inhibition in fear output neurons of the central amygdala -LRB- CEA -RRB- .
29|This increased inhibition results from a potentiation of fear input synapses to GABAergic intercalated amygdala neurons that project to CEA .
29|The main amygdala output for fear responses is the central medial nucleus -LRB- CEm -RRB- .
29|Indeed , amygdala projections to the periaqueductal gray , controlling behavioral freezing 3 , originate from CEm 4 .
29|On the input side , the lateral amygdala is the main target of thalamic and cortical structures conveying CSt information to the amygdala 5,6 .
29|RESULTS To test whether extinction depends on increased levels of feed-forward inhibition in CEm , we first compared the responses of CEm neurons to BLA inputs -LRB- Fig. 1a -RRB- in coronal slices of the amygdala obtained from rats that were previously subjected to fear conditioning only -LRB- n = 16 -RRB- vs. rats that were fear conditioned and trained on extinction the next day -LRB- n = 14 ; Fig. 1b -RRB- .
29|Twenty-four hours after exposure to context B , we anesthetized the rats and prepared coronal sections of their amygdala .
29|Extinction was shown to depend on NMDA-dependent synaptic plasticity in the amygdala29 -- 31 .
29|Moreover , these changes require infralimbic activity during extinction training , suggesting that the infralimbic cortex drives extinction-related plasticity in the amygdala .

31|Research examining the neural syshave focused on two interconnected brain regions : tems of fear extinction in nonhuman animals have fothe amygdala and the ventral medial prefrontal cortex cused on two interconnected brain regions : the ventral -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- .
31|Consistent with animal models suggesting medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- and the amygdala .

31|The present study Two recent studies have suggested that the vmPFC attempts to expand our understanding of the neural may affect fear inhibition by influencing specific subremechanisms of fear inhibition across species by using gions within the amygdala .

31|Although other pharmacologicalmanipulations -LRB- e.g. , GABA , Physiological Assessment of Fear Conditioning dopamine , acetylcholine antagonists -RRB- have also been and Extinction shown to influence extinction learning , most of these Subjects who failed to show acquisition of the CR as were delivered systemically , precluding the conclusion indicated by a differential skin conductance response that the effects involve the amygdala -LRB- see Myers and to the CS relative to the CS were eliminated from Davis , 2002 , for a review -RRB- .
31|All trials on which a shock animals indicate that both the amygdala and vmPFC are was delivered were excluded from analysis , since we important regions to investigate further in our efforts were only interested in learned responses to the CS .
31|In day 1 , the first CS and CS trial of each phase was humans , an fMRI study examined amygdala activation excluded from analysis , since learning had not yet ocduring both acquisition and extinction of conditioned curred on the first trial of extinction , and in acquisition , fear and found an amygdala response during both although the subjects were instructed of the CS-US constages of learning -LRB- LaBar et al. , 1998 -RRB- .
31|There was also a significant differential SCR amygdala activation .

31|Although fear learning fear in humans , the present results on extinction learning through instruction has been shown to be dependent largely support what has been learned from research on the amygdala for expression -LRB- Funayama et al. , 2001 -RRB- , with nonhuman animals .

31|This reversal of the amygdala re - Overall , activation of the subgenual anterior cingulate sponse in early extinction was unexpected , especially in all phases of the study was characterized primarily given that the only previous report of extinction learning as a depression in the BOLD response to the CS that in humans -LRB- LaBar et al. , 1998 -RRB- showed the opposite diminished as extinction learning progressed .

31|A previous study by Kim et al. -LRB- 2003 -RRB- Understanding how fears are acquired is an important showed an inverse correlation between activation of this step in our ability to translate basic research to the subgenual anterior cingulate region and the amygdala treatment of fear-related disorders .

31|The data were temporally and spatially smoothed -LRB- 4 The amygdala modulates prefrontal cortex activity relative to condimm FWHM -RRB- and motion corrected .
33|We wanted to use a design that would allow us to examine acute retrieval-induced biochemical changes that would be taking place on a brief time scale , but that would also be predictive of long-term synaptic plasticity , since there is an overlapping locus of plasticity for extinction and fear conditioning in the lateral amygdala -LRB- 28 -RRB- .
33|At the time of euthanasia , the lateral amygdala was extracted , frozen , homogenized , and probed on Western blots for phospho-GluR1 .
33|These findings suggest that the 2 different treatments -LRB- Ret + Ext , vs. No Ret + Ext -RRB- engage different molecular mechanisms in the lateral amygdala , and lead to a drastically different behavioral outcome .
33|Our GluR1 results suggest that a process taking place in the lateral amygdala may underlie this effect .
33|Our results are consistent with the idea that an adaptive purpose of reconsolidation is to incorporate new information at the time of retrieval , and to update a memory -LRB- 4 , 8 , 14 -RRB- -- in the present case leading to destabilization of the initial trace in the lateral amygdala , and the re-encoding of the once fear-inducing CS as safe .
34|For instance , unlike the distributed cortical representation of declarative memories20 , conditioned fear has a more discrete neural representation localized in the amygdala21 .
34|Indeed , in the lateral amygdala pharmacological blockade of the molecular cascade engaged by retrieval prevents the reconsolidation of fear memories in rats4 .
34|Interestingly , plasticity in the lateral amygdala induced by the CS retrieval was impaired by the presentation of a CS one hour later , indicating possible interference with the reconsolidation process , similar to the interference caused to reconsolidation by pharmacological blockade in rats4 .
36|Although it has been proposed that the amygdala , a brain region important for emotional processing5 -- 8 , has a role in anxiety9 -- 13 , neural mechanisms that control anxiety remain unclear .
36|With the capability of optogenetics14 -- 16 to control not only cell types but also specific connections between cells , we observed that temporally precise optogenetic stimulation of basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- terminals in the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA-achieved by viral transduction of the BLA with a codon-optimized channelrhodopsin followed by restricted illumination in downstream CeA - exerted an acute , reversible anxiolytic effect .
36|Although amygdala microcircuitry for conditioned fear has been optogenetically dissected18 ,19 , the causal underpinnings of unconditioned anxiety11 have not yet been investigated with cellular precision .
36|Pointing to the need for precise optogenetic exploration , the amygdala is composed of functionally and morphologically heterogeneous subnuclei with complex interconnectivity .
36|The primary output region of the amygdala is the CeM23 ,24 which -LRB- when chemically or electrically excited -RRB- mediates autonomic and behavioral responses associated with fear and anxiety via projections to the brainstem25 .
36|In the course of providing insight into native anxiogenic and anxiolytic processes , these findings demonstrate that anxiety is continuously regulated by balanced antagonistic pathways within the amygdala , and illustrate the importance of resolving specific projections in the study of neural circuit function relevant to psychiatric disease .
39|Research Damage to the Lateral and Central , but Not Other , Amygdaloid Nuclei Prevents the Acquisition of Auditory Fear Conditioning Karim Nader , Pedram Majidishad , Prin Amorapanth , and Joseph E. LeDoux1 W.M. Keck Foundation Laboratory for Neurobiology , Center for Neural Science , New York University , New York , New York 10003 , USA It is well established that the amygdala plays an essential role in Pavlovian fear conditioning , with the lateral nucleus serving as the interface with sensorysy stems that transmit the conditioned stimulus and the central nucleus as the link with motor regions that control conditioned fear responses .
39|The lateral nucleus connects with the central nucleus directlyand bywayof several other amygdala regions , including the basal , accessory basal , and medial nuclei .
39|To determine which of these regions is necessary , and thus whether conditioning requires the direct or one of the indirect intra-amygdala pathways , we made lesions in rats of the lateral , central , basal , accessorybasal , and medial nuclei , as well as combined lesions of the basal and accessorybasal nuclei and of the entire amygdala .
39|Animals that received lesions of the lateral or central nucleus , or of the entire amygdala , were dramatically impaired , whereas the other lesions had little effect .
39|The neural circuits underlying Pavlovian fear conditioning are believed to involve transmission of the conditioned stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- and the control of conditioned fear responses bywayof projections from the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CE -RRB- to brainstem areas -LRB- see Maren and Fanselow 1996 ; Davis and Lee 1998 ; Fendt and Fanselow 1999 ; LeDoux 2000 -RRB- .
39|Given that the LA projects directlyto the CE -LRB- Paré et al. 1995 ; Pitkänen et al. 1997 -RRB- , it is possible that these two nuclei and the connections between them fullyaccount for the amygdala 's role in fear conditioning .
39|However , there are several other routes within the amygdala through which processing in LA could reach CE .
39|The goal of the present studywas to re-examine the contribution of amygdala areas to fear conditioning by placing discrete lesions in several of the major nuclear regions , especiallythose that might serve as links between sensory processing of the CS and control of the expression of the conditioned responses .
39|Further , a group sustaining large bilateral lesions that essentiallydestroy ed the entire amygdala was also included to determine the maximal effects of amygdala damage .
39|Entire Amygdala Of the seven animals that received large amygdala lesions , three were excluded from the statistical analysis due to sparing of significant amounts of the amygdala .
39|The remaining four animals sustained massive damage that included all amygdala nuclei .
39|Of these , 15 were excluded due to excessive sparing of tissue or because the lesions infringed on adjacent amygdala nuclei .
39|In addition to the AB , the periamygdala and pyriform cortex were consistentlydamaged .
39|in the groups with large amygdala lesions or with lesions of the LA or CE .
39|The large-amygdala-lesion group , and the groups with LA and CE lesions froze significantlyless than both the unoperated controls or sham groups -LRB- Ps < 0.05 -RRB- , and at comparable levels to each other and to unpaired controls .
39|DISCUSSION To determine which amygdala nuclei are necessary for the acquisition of conditioned fear responses -LRB- freezing -RRB- to auditorystimuli , we made lesions of either the entire amygdala , or of specific amygdala nuclei , including the LA , B , CE , AB , and B combined with AB or M .
39|All Amy , entire amygdala ; CE , central nucleus ; LA , lateral nucleus ; B , basal nucleus ; AB , accessory basal nucleus ; B + AB , basal and accessory basal nuclei ; M , medial nucleus ; CP , caudate/putamen .
39|* , PL , OS because each is a potential link between sensoryand motor processing within the amygdala -LRB- see above -RRB- .
39|Large lesions of the amygdala blocked fear conditioning , as has long been known -LRB- e.g. , Blanchard and Blanchard 1972 -RRB- .
39|This double dissociation shows there are two output systems for the amygdala .
39|We used electrolytic lesions because these can be restricted to small regions of the amygdala with minimal infringement onto neighboring structures .
39|Given the pattern of the present results , together with previouslypublished findings showing that fiber - sparing neurotoxic lesions of the LA and B together disrupt fear conditioning -LRB- e.g. , Sananes and Davis 1992 ; Maren et al. 1996 -RRB- , it is unlikelythat damage to fibers passing through the amygdala accounts for our results .
39|Our results are most directlyapplicable to auditoryfear conditioning but mayalso applyto studies in which other discrete unimodal sensorystimuli are used as a CS since the LA is the main link in the amygdala with sensory systems in mammals -LRB- LeDoux et al. 1990b ; Amaral et al. 1992 ; Pitkanen et al , 1997 ; McDonald 1998 -RRB- .
39|In contrast , our findings may not applyto contextual conditioning , which is believed to involve connections from the hippocampus to the amygdala -LRB- Phillips and LeDoux 1992 ; Kim et al. 1993 -RRB- , because the main projections from the hippocampus terminate in the B , AB , and CE -LRB- Canteras and Swanson 1992 -RRB- .
39|Nevertheless , additional studies are needed to clarifythe role of amygdala regions in contextual conditioning .
40|As amygdala lesions prevent the acquisition of fear responses and the lateral amygdaloid -LRB- LA -RRB- nucleus is the main input station of the amygdala for auditory afferents , the effect of auditory fear conditioning on the sensory responsiveness of LA neurons has been examined .
40|Such changes have never been observed in the amygdala except in cases where the CS ? had been paired to the US before and fear responses not extinguished .
40|Much evidence implicates the amygdala in fear learning and expression .
40|Moreover , amygdala lesions prevent the acquisition of classically conditioned fear responses -LRB- Kapp et al. 1979 ; Gentile et al. 1986 ; Iwata et al. 1986 ; Hitchcock and Davis 1987 ; LeDoux et al. .
40|These and other findings -LRB- for review , see Davis 1992 ; LeDoux 1995 -RRB- have prompted investigators to search for the cellular correlates of fear learning in the amygdala .
40|As the lateral amygdaloid -LRB- LA -RRB- nucleus is the main input station of the amygdala for auditory afferents -LRB- LeDoux et al. 1990a , b ; Romanski and LeDoux 1992 -RRB- , a few studies have examined how auditory fear conditioning affects toneevoked LA responses -LRB- Quirk et al. 1995 ; Rogan et al. 1997 -RRB- .

40|To determine whether the depression of CS ? - evoked activity reflected habituation of responses , we analyzed the auditory responsiveness of 14 additional LA cells recorded in the course of previous extracellular studies on the activity of amygdala neurons -LRB- Collins and Pare ´ 1999 ; D. Pare ´ , unpubl . -RRB- .
40|Several studies using discriminative fear conditioning have reported specific increases in the responsiveness of other amygdala neurons to the CS + -LRB- see , for example , Pascoe and Kapp 1985 ; Maren et al. 1991 ; McEchron et al. .
40|However , in contrast with the present findings , decreases in responsiveness to the CS ? were not observed in the amygdala except in cases where the CS ? had been paired previously to the US and the fear responses not extinguished , an approach known as reversal .
40|If true , this finding would constitute strong evidence that the amygdala does more than relay sensory inputs to brain structures mediating fear responses , a much debated issue -LRB- Cahill et al. 1999 ; Fanselow and LeDoux 1999 -RRB- .
40|We chose this species because the large size of cat brains facilitate the placement of multiple microelectrodes in different nuclei of the amygdala .
40|Then , an array of 21 tungsten microelectrodes -LRB- 3 rows of 7 electrodes -RRB- was lowered until the electrodes reached the dorsal aspect of the amygdala .
44|We found that a central component of extinction-induced erasure is the synaptic removal of calcium-permeable ? - amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate receptors -LRB- AMPARs -RRB- in the lateral amygdala .

44|Cue-dependent fear conditioning is thought to be mediated by the potentiation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- -LRB- 13,14 -RRB- .

46|Activation of lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- pyramidal neurons by aversive stimuli is thought to drive the formation of these associative fear memories ; yet , there have been no direct tests of this hypothesis .
46|The lateral nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- is a site of associative plasticity , where US-evoked depolarization of LA pyramidal neurons is thought to instruct plasticity at synapses formed by CS inputs onto the same neurons -LRB- 5 -- 7 -RRB- .
46|Although optical stimulation of LA pyramidal neurons produced some freezing behavior , these levels were considerably lower than fear responses evoked by stimulation of the central nucleus of the amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- -LRB- reviewed in ref .
46|In addition to being essential for aversively motivated learning , plasticity in the LA is also required for several forms of appetitively motivated learning -LRB- 43 -- 45 -RRB- and a number of studies have found that separate populations of amygdala neurons mediate aversive and appetitive processing -LRB- 46 -- 48 -RRB- .
46|Thus separate , intermixed populations of amygdala neurons are likely to participate in producing different behavioral responses -LRB- i.e. , aversively vs. appetitively motivated -RRB- .
46|The brains were then removedand blocked -LRB- around the amygdala -RRB- and postfixed in 4 % PFA overnight at 4 ° C. Brains were then cut into 40-?m-thick sections on a vibratome and immersed in 1 % sodium borohydride and then 1 % hydrogen peroxide .
46|This analysis was applied to each amygdala section in which ChR2 label was present .

47|We begin by conditioning an animal to associate a foot-shock with optogenetic stimulation of auditory inputs targeting the amygdala , a brain region known to be essential for fear conditioning3 -- 8 .
47|To investigate the synaptic basis underlying this associative memory we replaced a tone with optogenetic stimulation of neural inputs to the lateral amygdala originating from auditory nuclei .

47|amygdala -LRB- Extended Data Fig. 4 -RRB- .
47|To examine if LTP occurred after pairing optical CS with foot-shock -LRB- Fig. 1d , refs3 -- 8 -RRB- , we prepared amygdala brain slices from animals receiving unpaired , paired , or no conditioning , and measured the AMPA receptor component -LRB- A -RRB- and NMDA receptor component -LRB- N -RRB- of the optically driven synaptic response -LRB- Fig 1c -RRB- .
47|The A/N ratio increased in animals receiving paired conditioning indicating that LTP had occurred11 ,12 at optically driven inputs to lateral amygdala neurons .
47|If LTP occurred at the optically driven synapse onto the lateral amygdala , and this LTP contributes to the formation of a memory , reversing LTP with LTD -LRB- refs 13 , 14 -RRB- should inactivate the memory .
47|Or is the LTP conditioning merely potentiating random inputs that are sufficient to drive lateral amygdala neurons that reduce lever pressing ?
47|To confirm that the test and conditioning stimuli were producing the expected synaptic effects , we conducted in vivo recordings in the lateral amygdala of anesthetized rats expressing oChIEF in auditory regions -LRB- see methods -RRB- .
47|Brief light pulses at the recording site produced in vivo field responses -LRB- that resembled optically-evoked responses in amygdala brain slices ; Extended Data Fig. 9 -RRB- , which were not affected by optical CS , depressed by optical LTD conditioning , and potentiated by optical LTP conditioning -LRB- Fig. 4 ; Extended Data Fig. 10 -RRB- .
47|In two groups of naïve animals we infected unilaterally auditory regions with AAV-oChIEF , and pharmacologically ablated the contralateral amygdala -LRB- see methods -RRB- .
47|This result is consistent with a memory model in which tone conditioning induces LTP at auditory inputs to the lateral amygdala and that subsequent LTD at these synapses reverses LTP and thereby inactivates the memory .
47|Formation of an associative memory produced LTP at the lateral amygdala optogenetic input , as indicated by an increased A/N .
47|This result suggests that non-specific potentiation of auditory inputs to the lateral amygdala is not sufficient to produce a CR .
47|Thus , LTP at auditory inputs to the amygdala may be necessary but not sufficient to produce an associative memory .

50|Different efferent projections of the central amygdala thus appear to mediate the behavioral and autonomic concomitants of conditioned fear .
50|The central circuitry mediating the classicacl onditioning of fear to an acoustic stimulus in rats involves transmission through primary auditory structures of the brain stem to the auditory receptive region of the thalamus and , from there , directly to the amygdala -LRB- LeDoux et al. , 1984-1986a , b ; LeDoux , 1986 , 1987 ; Received Aug. 13 , 1987 ; revised Nov. 19 , 1987 ; accepted Nov. 27 , 1987 .
50|Since the major projection from the acoustic thalamus terminates in the lateral nucleus and the amygdalostriatal zone -LRB- LeDoux et al. , 1985 -RRB- , one of these regions probably serves as the sensory interface of the amygdala during conditioning -LRB- Cicchetti et al. , 1987 -RRB- .
50|In the present study we have examined the effects of damage to 3 of the areas purported to receive efferents from the central amygdala , including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- , the lateral hypothalamic area -LRB- LH -RRB- , and the midbrain central gray -LRB- CG -RRB- region .
50|Our objectives were to determine whether such lesions would reproduce the disruptive effects of amygdala damage on fear conditioning , to determine whether the disruption of fear conditioning produced by these lesions is due to the destruction of neurons intrinsic to the lesioned area or to damage to fibers of passage , and to determine whether autonomic and behavioral conditioned fear responsesm ight be separately disrupted by lesions of different projection targets .
50|Placement of brain lesions Projection targets of the central nucleus of the amygdala were destroyed electrolytically and/or bv microiniection of ibotenic acid .
50|The magnitude and pattern of the changesin MAP evoked by the CS in these rats with LH lesions were similar to those in rats with lesions of the dorsal amygdala -LRB- see Iwata et al. , 1986b -RRB- .
50|ince lesions of the amygdala or earlier stations -LRB- i.e. , auditory thalamus or inferior colliculus -RRB- in the fear-conditioning pathway disrupt both behavioral and autonomic responses -LRB- L eDoux et al. , 1984 , 1986a , b ; Iwata et al. , 1986a -RRB- , these findings suggesthat the pathways mediating autonomic and behavioral conditioned fear responsesd iverge after the amygdala , with projections to the LH mediating autonomic changes and projections to the CG mediating behavioral changes .
50|Amygdal + hypothalamic autonomic conditioned fear-response pathway The viability of our hypothesis that classically conditioned changes in arterial pressure are mediated by projections from the ACE to the LH obviously depends on the existence of neural pathways connecting the central amygdala to the LH , as well as of pathways connecting the LH with premotor neurons of the autonomic nervous system .
50|The central amygdala also projects to the LH by way of the caudal substantia innominata -LRB- Krettek and Price , 1978 ; Watson et al. , 1983 -RRB- , which is viewed by some as a rostra1 extension of the central nucleus -LRB- de Olmos et al. , 1985 -RRB- .
50|LH neurons , in turn , are known to The Journal of Neuroscience , July 1988 , 8 -LRB- 7 -RRB- 2525 project to a variety of brain stem autonomic centers , including We assume that LH lesions disrupted the arterial pressure the rostra1 ventrolateral medulla , the dorsal motor nucleus of response by breaking a link between the central amygdala and the vagus , and the nucleus of the solitary tract -LRB- Ross et al. , 198 1 ; premotor neurons in the brain stem and spinal cord .
50|afferent and efferent connections of the LH are consistent with Evidence against the reinforcement interpretation and in fathis structure 's playing a crucial role in the mediation of car - vor of the motoric interpretation of the effects of LH lesions on diovascular-conditioned responses originating in the amygdala MAP conditioning is provided by our observation that sufficient and structures afferent to the amygdala .
50|Further , since amygdala lesions work of Smith and associates -LRB- 1980 -RRB- .
50|In studies of primates , interrupt both behavioral and MAP responses , while LH only they demonstrated that electrolytic lesions of the LH disrupted disrupts MAP responses , we are led to the conclusion that LH the expression of autonomic , but not behavioral , conditioned is efferent to the amygdala for the autonomic response .
50|Kapp et al. -LRB- 1984 -RRB- noting direct projections from the central amygdala to brain stem areas controlling the peripheral parasympathetic nerves , argue that these pathways might mediate the conditioned slowing of heart rate in the rabbit .
50|However , neurons in the LH project to the same parasympathetic regions in the brain stem that receive direct inputs from the central amygdala -LRB- Ross et al. , 198 1 ; van der Kooy , 1984 -RRB- .
50|Furthermore , our finding that IBO lesions of the caudal CG do interfere with stroyed by the electrolytic lesions of LH , the evidence available does not answer the question of whether LH neurons are a critical link between the central amygdala and the brain stem in the control of classically conditioned responses expressed through parasympathetic nerves .
50|By this reasoning , the central mechanism of fear is more likely to involve the amygdala than the CG .
50|Efferent projections of the amygdala , such as the CG and LH , might then be involved in the motoric expression of fear by linking the amygdala to appropriate motor systems .
50|The midbrain locomotor area receives projections from various limbic forebrain areas , including the central amygdala , and projects to spinal motor neurons .
50|Lesions ofthe CG would , by this interpretation , disconnect spinal motor systems from the amygdala .
50|Processes mediated by the amygdala would thus be deprived of access to final common pathways controlling emotional behavior when neurons in the caudal CG are destroyed .
50|Studies using electrical stimuli to evoke defensive behaviors in awake animals have led to the conclusion that a pathway originating in the amygdala , projecting to the hypothalamus and , from there , to the CG is essential to the expression of these responses -LRB- see Kaada , 1967 ; Fonberg , 1972 , 1973 ; Clemente and Chase , 1973 ; Siegel and Edinger , 1981 -RRB- .
50|Particularly relevant are the results of Hunsperger -LRB- 1956 -RRB- , showing that lesions of the hypothalmus or CG block the expression of defense responses evoked by amygdala stimulation .
50|Thus , electrical stimulation of sites in the amygdala , hypothalamus , and central gray evokes the cardiovascular defense pattern -LRB- Hilton and Zbrozyna , 1963 ; Hilton 1975 ; Yardley and Hilton , 1986 -RRB- .
50|We recently found that microinjection of excitatory amino acids into the amygdala of freely behaving , conscious rats evokes increases in arterial pressure and heart rate , responses indicative of sympathetic excitation -LRB- Iwata et al. , 1987 -RRB- .
50|Thus , studies using chemical stimuli to activate cardiovascular defense pathways suggest that the amygdala and probably the hypothalamus are important sites of integration .
50|While the contribution of the amygdala and hypothalamus agrees with the lesion results reported here , the CG findings do not .
50|The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the fear-conditioning pathway bifurcates in the amygdala , with projections from the central amygdala to the LH mediating conditioned autonomic responses , and projections from the central amygdala to the CG region mediating conditioned emotional behavior .
6|AMYGDALA MICROCIRCUITS CONTROLLING LEARNED FEAR Sevil Duvarci1 and Denis Pare2 1Institute of Neurophysiology , Neuroscience Center , Goethe-University , Frankfurt , 60590 , Germany 2Center for Molecular & Behavioral Neuroscience , Rutgers State University , 197 University Avenue , Newark , NJ 07102 Abstract We review recent work on the role of intrinsic amygdala networks in the regulation of classically conditioned defensive behaviors , commonly known as conditioned fear .
6|Keywords amygdala ; medial prefrontal cortex ; infralimbic ; prelimbic ; extinction ; fear conditioning This review focuses on learned fear and its regulation by intrinsic circuits of the amygdala .
6|Since this vast literature can not possibly be reviewed here , we will focus on a line of investigation that has been particularly active lately : the intrinsic amygdala circuits that mediate learned fear .
6|Anatomy and physiology of the amygdala The amygdala is a critical component of the neural circuitry underlying fear learning -LRB- Davis , 2000 ; LeDoux , 2000 -RRB- .
6|In broad strokes , LA is the main point of entry for sensory inputs into the amygdala , whereas CeM is the main source of amygdala projections to brainstem fear effector structures .
6|Central nucleus of the amygdala CeL and CeM each contain one main cell type -LRB- Hall , 1972 ; Kamal and Tömböl , 1975 ; McDonald , 1992 -RRB- thought to be GABAergic -LRB- Paré and Smith , 1993a ; McDonald and 1Although the vast majority of GABAergic neurons in the BLA are local-circuit cells , a recent study reported that a small subset of SOM + neurons located in or near the external capsule projects to the basal forebrain -LRB- McDonald et al. , 2012 -RRB- .
6|Indeed , intercalated cell clusters are found in two major fiber bundles of the amygdala : the external capsule , which borders it laterally , and the intermediate capsule , located in between BLA and CeA -LRB- Fig. 1B1 -RRB- .
6|Compared to the rest of the amygdala , ICMs express very high levels of ? opioid and dopamine type-1 receptors -LRB- Herkenham and Pert , 1982 ; Jacobsen et al. , 2006 ; Poulin et al. , 2008 -RRB- .
6|Intrinsic connectivity of the amygdala Relative to other nucleated structures of the brain , such as the thalamus , the amygdala stands out for its very strong intra - and internuclear connectivity .
6|Like the connections between different intercalated cell clusters , most internuclear amygdala connections have a preferential directionality .
6|Because CeM projections to brainstem fear effector neurons are much stronger than those originating from CeL -LRB- Hopkins and Holstege , 1978 ; Petrovich & Swanson , 1997 -RRB- , these differential connections are highly significant for the intra-amygdala mechanisms of conditioned fear .
6|Extrinsic connectivity of the amygdala Consistent with the fact that the amygdala has access to information about all sensory modalities , mammals readily develop conditioned fear responses to auditory , olfactory , or visual CSs -LRB- Domjan , 2006 -RRB- .
6|Multiple parallel routes exist for the transfer of CS and US information to the amygdala : via direct subcortical -LRB- pre-thalamic -RRB- routes , via the dorsal thalamus -LRB- generally posterior thalamic nuclei -RRB- , and via the cerebral cortex , mainly associative cortical areas -LRB- LeDoux et al. , 1990 ; Turner and Herkenham , 1991 ; McDonald , 1998 ; Linke et al. , 2000 -RRB- .
6|On the output side , the targets of the amygdala are extremely diverse , with BLA and CeA axons usually projecting to different sets of brain regions -LRB- Pitkanen , 2000 -RRB- .
6|Indeed , CeA supplies most amygdala projections to the brainstem nuclei that generate the behavioral and visceral correlates of conditioned fear , including the PAG , parabrachial nuclei , solitary nucleus and DVC -LRB- Hopkins and Holstege , 1978 -RRB- .
6|In contrast , BLA contributes most amygdala projections to the striatum , thalamus , and cerebral cortex .
6|Other amygdala outputs thought to contribute to conditioned fear include projections to BNST -LRB- Dong et al. , 2001 -RRB- and various hypothalamic nuclei -LRB- Pitkanen , 2000 -RRB- .
6|Finally , the amygdala can also indirectly influence the excitability of the entire prosencephalon via its projections to neuromodulatory cell groups -LRB- releasing acetylcholine , noradrenaline -- NA , and dopamine -- DA -RRB- of the basal forebrain and brainstem -LRB- Steriade and Pare , 2007 -RRB- .
6|Below , we concentrate on the intrinsic amygdala networks that process CS information from LA to CeA .
6|However , this focus does not imply that we consider the amygdala to be the sole site of plasticity for Pavlovian fear .
6|In fact , auditory fear conditioning leads to widespread synaptic plasticity in the brain , not only the amygdala , but also in the auditory thalamus and cortex -LRB- Weinberger , 2011 ; Letzkus et al. , 2011 -RRB- .
6|Thus , there is incontrovertible evidence that plasticity in both the amygdala and its afferent neurons contributes to fear conditioning .
6|Consistent with this , NE and DA receptor activation in the amygdala has been implicated in the acquisition of conditioned fear -LRB- Bush et al. , 2010 ; Greba et al. , 2001 ; Guarraci et al. , 1999 ; Nader and LeDoux , 1999 -RRB- .
6|Therefore , these two interneuron subtypes likely mediate different aspects of information processing in the amygdala .
6|Initially , CeA was conceived as a passive output station of the amygdala for fear expression -LRB- reviewed in Samson et al. , 2005 -RRB- .
6|Overall , the findings reviewed in this section suggest that multiple parallel disinhibitory circuits exist within the amygdala and that their dynamic interactions ultimately determine fear expression .
6|Fear extinction In the previous sections , we considered how intrinsic amygdala networks enable animals to learn that some stimuli predict danger .
6|A large body of evidence suggests that fear extinction is mediated by a distributed network that includes the amygdala , mPFC and hippocampus -LRB- see Pape and Pare , 2010 ; Herry et al. , 2010 ; Milad and Quirk , 2012 ; Maren et al. , 2013 -RRB- .
6|However , we will focus on the intrinsic circuits of the amygdala that support extinction learning and expression .
6|Irrespective of the underlying mechanisms however , the persistence of CS-evoked responses in LAv neurons despite their loss in LAd raises the intriguing possibility that extinction training causes a shift in the networks responsible for transferring CS information to the amygdala .
6|However , extinction cells have no counterpart in other amygdala nuclei .4 The existence of fear and extinction neurons in BA suggests that different circuits , mediating fear and extinction , co-exist within the amygdala .
6|Cell-type specific projections of fear and extinction neurons -LRB- within and/or outside the amygdala -RRB- likely underlie their contrasting functions .
6|Moreover , optogenetic silencing of IL-projecting BA neurons during extinction training results in poor extinction recall the next day -LRB- Senn et al. , 2014 -RRB- .5 In contrast , little is known about the connections of fear and extinction neurons within the amygdala .

7|Neurophysiological studies show that individual amygdala neurons respond differentially to a range of stimuli with positive or negative affective significance .
7|Meanwhile , increasingly specific lesion / inactivation studies reveal that the amygdala is necessary for processes -- e.g. , fear extinction and reinforcer devaluation -- that involve updating representations of value .
7|Furthermore , recent neuroimaging studies suggest that the human amygdala mediates performance on many reward-based decision-making tasks .
7|The encoding of affective significance by the amygdala might be best described as a representation of state value -- a representation that is useful for coordinating physiological , behavioral , and cognitive responses in an affective/emotional context .
7|Introduction For many years , the amygdala was thought of primarily as a center for fear in the brain .
7|Classic lesion and inactivation studies established that the amygdala is essential for the perception of fear , the expression of fearful behavior , and the acquisition of fear in response to stimuli that had been paired with aversive outcomes -LRB- Pavlovian fear conditioning -RRB- -LRB- e.g. -LSB- 3 -RSB- , reviewed in -LSB- 4 -RSB- -RRB- .
7|Neurophysiological studies , which also were mainly limited to rodents , showed that cells in the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- had firing rates that were highly sensitive to stimuli that were associated with fear-inducing events , and also with the aversive events themselves -LSB- 4,5 -RSB- .
7|While new light continues to be shed on the detailed functioning of the amygdala with regard to fear learning and fearful behavior , in recent years , a surge of work in humans and non-human © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. .
7|primates has led to an expanded conception of the amygdala 's role .
7|The anatomical connections of the amygdala in primates hint at a reason for this : especially compared to rodents , humans and non-human primates have a hugely elaborated prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- -LSB- 6 -RSB- , many parts of which -- especially medial and orbital areas -- have extensive bidirectional connections with the amygdala -LSB- 7 -- 10 -RSB- .
7|The amygdala receives input from a full range of higher sensory and poly-sensory areas , and projects back to them in turn , even to primary sensory targets -LRB- connections that may be unique to primates -RRB- -LSB- 11 -- 13 -RSB- .
7|Other targets of amygdala output include the hippocampus , basal ganglia , perirhinal and entorhinal cortices , the basal forebrain , and subcortical structures such as the hypothalamus -LSB- 14 -RSB- .
7|In sum , the anatomical situation of the amygdala seems to imply the potential for a far more wide-ranging role than `` danger alarm . ''
7|Using a combination of new techniques and innovative extensions of old ones , neuroscientists have uncovered a role for the amygdala in a wide variety of tasks with an emotional component , whether appetitive or aversive -LSB- 15 -RSB- .
7|As we discuss below , recent data implicates the amygdala in processing information related to both arousal and valence ; we will focus mainly , but not exclusively , on processing related to valence .
7|In contrast , most studies focused on the amygdala have not used decision-making tasks ; rather , they used classical or instrumental conditioning tasks , in which subjects learn the association between conditioned stimuli -LRB- CSs -RRB- and appetitive or aversive unconditioned stimuli -LRB- USs -RRB- .
7|Many types of associations between a CS and US may be formed during conditioning -LSB- 22 -RSB- -- such as those between the CS and the motor response elicited by the US , or the sensory properties of the US -- but , as we will discuss , considerable evidence now indicates that amygdala neurons encode information about the overall affective or motivational significance of USs associated with CSs .
7|Therefore , we would argue that information about `` valence '' encoded by the amygdala probably corresponds to `` value '' as it is studied in decision-making tasks ; we will therefore use the terms `` value '' and `` valence '' interchangeably .
7|This review will examine recent progress in our understanding of whether and how value -- in all its multifaceted senses -- is encoded by the amygdala in rodents , humans , and non-human primates .
7|We will consider the small but growing body of neurophysiological evidence concerning how the activity of individual amygdala neurons encodes the value of stimuli , and perhaps more general quantities , such as state value ; and we will examine how this view of amygdala function may be supported by recent evidence from lesions and inactivation of the amygdala , and from observation of amygdala activity using functional imaging .
7|Overall , recent work paints a compelling picture of the amygdala as a key brain area for the processing and propagation of signals pertaining to value , and therefore as an essential part of the neural foundation of motivated behavior and emotion .
7|A neurophysiological representation of value Until recent years , neurophysiological recording in the amygdala was mostly the province of rodents , with the exception of a few pioneering experiments in non-human primates -LSB- 23,24 -RSB- , and the majority of rodent studies were focused on fear conditioning .
7|These studies helped to establish the viewpoint that the amygdala -- particularly the lateral nucleus -- is a key structure in Pavlovian conditioning , at least of the aversive valence , because it is a site of convergence for information about conditioned stimuli -LRB- CSs -RRB- and unconditioned stimuli -LRB- USs -RRB- -LSB- 4 -RSB- , and because fear learning is closely connected with synaptic changes in the lateral nucleus -LRB- reviewed in -LSB- 25 -RSB- -RRB- .
7|While , at the time , neuroscientists often used the term `` fear memory '' to describe the representation that seems to be stored in the lateral nucleus , these results were equally consistent with the amygdala storing a representation of stimulus value .
7|In terms of Pavlovian fear conditioning : as the previously neutral CS -LRB- often a light or tone -RRB- becomes associated with an aversive US -LRB- typically a shock -RRB- , the CS acquires a negative value , which is reflected in lasting changes in the responses of individual amygdala neurons to the CS -LRB- as in -LSB- 5 -RSB- -RRB- .
7|In macaque monkeys , Paton and colleagues -LSB- 26 -RSB- found that the responses of many individual amygdala neurons reflect both the positive and negative values of visual stimuli .
7|Contrary to the view of the amygdala as a fear center , the authors found similar numbers of neurons that respond more strongly to a CS that has been associated with reward -LRB- positive value-coding neurons -RRB- or with air-puff -LRB- negative value-coding neurons ; Fig. 1b , c -RRB- .
7|More recently , Belova , Paton and colleagues added to the picture by showing that this putative value representation in the amygdala is not limited to recently learned CSs -LSB- 27  -RSB- : rather , value-coding neurons respond in a consistent fashion to all events during a trial , including the rewards and air-puffs themselves -LRB- stimuli that are primary reinforcers ; Fig. 2a , b -RRB- and a fixation point -LRB- a mildly positive stimulus conditioned over a long time period ; Fig. 2c , d -RRB- .
7|Furthermore , as the same group also found to be the case in OFC -LSB- 28 -RSB- , individual amygdala neurons often integrated information about impending reinforcement of both valences , and therefore did not simply represent the sensory properties of a preferred US associated with a CS -LSB- 27  -RSB- .
7|Based on these findings , the authors hypothesize that amygdala neurons may track state value -- the overall value of an organism 's situation , which may be modulated as different stimuli appear in the environment .
7|The results of Paton , Belova and colleagues -LSB- 26,27  ,29  ,30 -RSB- demonstrate a strong connection between value signals in the amygdala and monkey behavior : notably , value signals change as fast as monkeys learn , as demonstrated by anticipatory licking and eye closure , upon reversal of reinforcement contingencies -LSB- 26 -RSB- ; and both the value signal and licking behavior are graduated across three levels of value -LRB- strong positive , weak positive , and negative -RRB- -LSB- 27  -RSB- .
7|Recently , it has been shown that the activity of individual amygdala neurons also correlates with skin conductance responses -LRB- SCRs -RRB- in monkeys , a physiological measure connected with emotional arousal -LSB- 31 -RSB- , whether the SCRs are evoked by viewing rewarded images or simply by the monkey 's internal state -LRB- i.e. , no outside emotional stimulus is present -RRB- .
7|In another avenue of research , two groups found that individual amygdala neurons respond differentially to more complex emotional stimuli : faces or vocalizations of conspecifics with different facial expressions , ranging from appeasing to threatening -LSB- 32,33 -RSB- .
7|Interestingly , both studies found more neurons that had a stronger response to threatening cues than appeasing cues , harking back to the idea of the amygdala as a fear center , and consistent with a functional imaging study that found a stronger response to threatening faces in the monkey basolateral complex -LRB- BLA -RRB- -LSB- 34 -RSB- .
7|In addition to encoding the valence of affectively salient stimuli , it is important to note the increasing evidence that the amygdala also carries signals related to emotional intensity , regardless of valence .
7|Belova et al. -LSB- 29  -RSB- found that the responses of many amygdala neurons are enhanced when stimuli are unexpected ; some show this enhancement to rewarding stimuli only , some to aversive stimuli only , and some to both .
7|Similarly , Shabel and Janak -LSB- 35 -RSB- , working in rat amygdala , have recently reported a group of neurons that respond similarly to appetitive and aversive CSs , and that have responses that are correlated with blood pressure -- a physiological measure of arousal .
7|Other evidence from rodent amygdala neurophysiology , which was long focused on fear conditioning , has begun to converge with that from primate neurophysiology to support the idea of a general representation of value in the amygdala .
7|Tye et al. -LSB- 42  -RSB- use a similar task to demonstrate that successful association of a cue with sucrose reward is correlated with the number of BLA neurons that respond to the cue , and that this is based on the rapid , NMDA-dependent strengthening of thalamo-amygdala synaptic connections ; in a novel extension of this line of work , Popescu et al. -LSB- 43 -RSB- report that coherent gamma oscillations develop between BLA and striatum in response to a tone that is associated with reward .
7|Notably , even coming from the sub-specialty of rodent fear conditioning , there is increasing evidence that individual amygdala neurons , even when they are task-responsive , are not uniformly excited by aversive stimuli .
7|Taking the amygdala 's representation of value off-line Non-human primate studies Lesions of the amygdala , which produce an extraordinarily wide range of behavioral and emotional effects , have historically provided a rich source of data about possible functions of the amygdala -LSB- 45,46 -RSB- -LRB- reviewed in -LSB- 47 -RSB- -RRB- .
7|In recent years , neuroscientists working in rodents and non-human primates have used newer techniques -- such as temporary pharmacological inactivation -- to silence the amygdala , and those who work with lesions have increasingly used anatomically precise techniques that spare fibers of passage , such as excitotoxic chemical injections .
7|These studies provide invaluable clues as to how signals provided by the amygdala -- which , as we have seen , carry information about stimulus value , and perhaps even state value -- might be utilized in neural circuits that underlie a wide range of motivated behavior .
7|For example , Antoniadis et al. have shown that the primate amygdala is indeed necessary for fear learning resulting from Pavlovian conditioning -LSB- 48,49 -RSB- .
7|In these studies , complete amygdala lesions made using ibotenic acid injections prevented acquisition of conditioned fear , as measured by the fear-potentiated startle reflex ; however , they did not prevent the memory or expression of conditioned fear that was acquired before the lesions .
7|This latter finding contrasts with a number of earlier findings in rats -LRB- most recently -LSB- 50 -RSB- -RRB- , but is consistent with findings in human patients with amygdala lesions -LRB- e.g. , -LSB- 51 -RSB- -RRB- , and therefore seems to reflect a genuine species difference .
7|Expanding upon the ideas of Antoniadis et al. , we would speculate that the orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- or other prefrontal areas -- structures that are highly elaborated in primates as compared with rodents , and that are interconnected with the amygdala -- might acquire information during or after learning sufficient to support expression of previously learned fear .
7|Similarly , new fiber-sparing lesion studies confirm the importance of the amygdala in behavioral and physiological responding to naturally fear-inducing stimuli .
7|In a pair of recent studies , Machado et al. found that monkeys with amygdala lesions show decreased defensive behaviors towards a rubber snake or an unfamiliar human intruder , both of which are inherently aversive stimuli for monkeys -LSB- 52,53 -RSB- .
7|Notably , amygdala lesions did not disrupt defensive behavior towards objects with learned connotations of fear -LRB- including both objects and social signals -RRB- -LSB- 53 -RSB- , which seems consistent with the amygdala being necessary for learning , but not retention or expression , of conditioned fear .
7|Moving beyond the fear domain , new lesion studies in non-human primates continue to support an essential role for the amygdala in reward assessment -LSB- 54,55 -RSB- , and particularly in updating the value of a reward during a reinforcer devaluation procedure -LRB- -LSB- 55 -- 57  -RSB- ; see Fig. 4 -RRB- .
7|In contrast , monkeys with excitotoxic amygdala lesions -LSB- 56,57  -RSB- or temporary inactivation of the amygdala during the satiation procedure -LSB- 58 -RSB- are unable to refrain from choosing objects associated with the devalued reward .
7|Interestingly , amygdala inactivation after satiation -- during the object choice task -- does not impair monkeys ' choices -LSB- 58 -RSB- .
7|Thus , it seems that updating the value signal in the amygdala is required for reinforcer devaluation , but an on-line value representation in the amygdala is not necessary for expression of the updated preferences , which might be guided by expected outcome signals in the OFC or elsewhere in the absence of amygdala activity .
7|Finally , a recent fiber-sparing lesion study -LSB- 57  -RSB- , along with re-analysis of previous data -LSB- 59 -RSB- , has caused neuroscientists to reconsider the role of the amygdala in reversal learning -- a frequently used paradigm in which stimulus-reinforcement contingencies are switched .
7|The primate neurophysiology studies cited above -LSB- 26,29 -RSB- confirm that the responses of individual amygdala neurons change upon reversal , and that the timing of the changes coincides with behavioral indicators of learning .
7|In contrast , Izquierdo and Murray -LSB- 57  -RSB- found that monkeys with excitotoxic amygdala lesions learned reversals of object-reward associations just as quickly as controls , even though the same monkeys were impaired at reinforcer devaluation .
7|There are several possible reasons for this apparent contradiction : one is that the amygdala may normally participate in reversal learning , but in the absence of value signals coming from the amygdala , the OFC and/or other areas may be able to support this simple kind of learning as well .
7|As the amygdala seems to be unequivocally required for acquisition of conditioned fear , it is possible that the aversive element of the task may preferentially engage the amygdala .
7|Rodent studies In parallel with the rise of sophisticated techniques for silencing the amygdala in non-human primates , recent studies in rodents have increasingly used fiber-sparing lesions and pharmacological inactivation of the amygdala .
7|Many of these experiments have confirmed and extended the results of amygdala lesion studies in non-human primates ; for example , two studies -LSB- 60,61  -RSB- have recently confirmed that excitotoxic lesions of the rat BLA cause deficits in reinforcer devaluation , just as they do in monkeys .
7|Based on reinforcement revaluation experiments such as those described above , it appears that the amygdala plays a key role in representing the value of a reinforcer -LRB- US -RRB- , and reconnecting the changing value of a US to its associated cue -LRB- CS -RRB- or action .
7|This is consistent with the neurophysiological findings that individual amygdala neurons encode the values of USs in a graduated manner -LSB- 27  ,29  ,30 -RSB- .
7|However , a pair of recent studies by Rabinak et al. -LSB- 63,64 -RSB- complicate this picture by demonstrating that the amygdala does not seem to be required for aversive reinforcer inflation .
7|The apparent contradiction between the findings of Rabinak et al. -LSB- 63,64 -RSB- and those regarding revaluation of positive reinforcements might be explained in a number of ways ; perhaps the most convincing is that the paradigm of Rabinak et al. involved only a single outcome , which , as previously suggested -LSB- 61  -RSB- , might simplify the reinforcer revaluation problem enough that it can be solved by other brain areas without input from the amygdala .
7|This finding is consistent with recent studies in human patients , which have shown that amygdala lesions impair decision-making under conditions of risk -LSB- 68,69 -RSB- , specifically resulting from difficulty in weighing potential gains -LRB- but not losses -RRB- -LSB- 69 -RSB- .
7|These impairments are all understandable if we posit that a loss of online calculation of value by the amygdala , whether of cues or expected outcomes , prevents effective choice assessment by cortical areas such as OFC .
7|Current thinking about extinction -LRB- summarized in -LSB- 73 -RSB- -RRB- holds that the original CS-US association is preserved in the brain , but amygdaladependent inhibitory mechanisms suppress the fear response in the presence of the extinguished cue .
7|As noted by Laurent and Westbrook -LSB- 72 -RSB- , extinction is context-dependent ; thus , the amygdala 's role in extinction may be to interact with the PFC to adjust the value of the extinguished CS when it occurs in the right context .
7|The value signal in BOLD Consistent with the historically prevalent view of the amygdala as a fear center , functional imaging studies in humans have often focused on the amygdala in the context of aversive events .
7|Therefore , there is a large body of literature -- including many ongoing research efforts -- that connects increases in the blood-oxygenation level-dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- signal in the amygdala to stimuli that induce fear or apprehension .
7|Many studies have shown that activation of the amygdala is correlated with fear learning in Pavlovian conditioning paradigms ; recently , for example , amygdala activity was connected to the association of specific faces with shock -LSB- 74,75 -RSB- , an effect which seems to be abolished -LRB- both behaviorally and neurally -RRB- by the prosocial effects of oxytocin -LSB- 75 -RSB- .
7|Moreover , Schiller et al. -LSB- 76 -RSB- recently showed that amygdala activation discriminates between a CS -LRB- an angry face -RRB- that is currently predictive of shock and a CS that is no longer predictive of shock in an aversive reversal-learning paradigm .
7|In addition to direct fear conditioning , BOLD signal in the amygdala correlates with fear learning that takes place via observation of aversive events happening to others -LSB- 77 -RSB- .
7|These results are consistent with the idea that , just as in monkeys and rodents , human fear learning is likely to involve the representation of the negative value of learned and inherently aversive stimuli in the amygdala .
7|In recent years , neuroscientists have increasingly used fMRI to study the amygdala in the context of reward-related tasks and conditions that combine elements of reward and punishment -LRB- many of which are reviewed in -LSB- 78 -RSB- -RRB- .
7|Indeed , a recent meta-analysis -LSB- 79 -RSB- reveals that , across many functional imaging studies , a core region of the human amygdala -- tentatively identified with the basal and lateral nuclei -- reliably responds to both appetitive and aversive stimuli .
7|This is consistent with neurophysiological findings in non-human primates -LSB- 26,27  -RSB- , as is the demonstration that human amygdala activation increases with the selection of larger rewards -LSB- 80 -RSB- .
7|Meanwhile , there is increasing evidence from fMRI that the human amygdala -- specifically , a circuit involving amygdala and PFC -- participates in the extinction of fear learning -LSB- 81 -RSB- , in addition to its initial acquisition , and also in learning to avoid aversive outcomes -LSB- 82 -RSB- .
7|Moreover , Hampton et al. -LSB- 83  -RSB- use functional imaging to demonstrate that lesions of the amygdala disrupt reward expectation signals in ventromedial PFC , implying that a representation of stimulus value in PFC may be `` downstream '' from the value signal in the amygdala .
7|Notably , Talmi et al. -LSB- 84 -RSB- have recently demonstrated a correlation between BOLD signal in the human amygdala and magnitude of pavlovian-instrumental transfer -LRB- PIT -RRB- : the automatic increase in vigor of a reward-associated instrumental response -LRB- in this case , squeezing a handgrip -RRB- in the presence of a CS that has previously predicted reward .
7|This is consistent with the idea that the amygdala encodes the motivational value of CSs , whether they are acting as a cue to expect reward , or as secondary reinforcers -- stimuli that have acquired the ability to act as rewards for instrumental behaviors -- as suggested by Tye et al. -LSB- 85 -RSB- .
7|In an interesting twist , functional imaging during a gambling task -LSB- 86 -RSB- shows that amygdala activation correlates with the strength of the `` framing effect '' -- the economic phenomenon of risk-aversion when a gamble is presented in terms of gains , and risk-seeking when the same gamble is presented in terms of losses .
7|Decisions in keeping with the framing effect , in both directions , are correlated with BOLD signal in the amygdala ; and in fact , the framing effect on both behavior and neural activity is enhanced in subjects who are homozygous for the short variant of the serotonin transporter gene -LSB- 87  -RSB- , a condition that enhances amygdala reactivity in a variety of situations -LSB- 88 -RSB- .
7|The framing effect might result from presenting the same choice in two different emotional contexts , necessitating a recalculation of the value of each option in the current context , which is reflected in amygdala activity .
7|Conclusions Here we have reviewed the latest progress towards understanding how value may be represented in the amygdala .
7|We would posit -LRB- as we do in -LSB- 27  -RSB- -RRB- that neurons in the amygdala , as a population , encode a general representation of value that seems to incorporate learned and unlearned stimuli , contexts -LRB- such as initial or reversed reinforcement contingencies -RRB- , and reinforcement history , and thus could be interpreted as state value .
7|As we have reviewed , the great majority of recent studies that concern the amygdala -- whether in rodents , monkeys , or humans -- can be well understood within a framework in which the amygdala is a key area for calculating value -- and recalculating it under changing circumstances , such as reinforcer devaluation or extinction .
7|Whether value is initially calculated in the amygdala or not , it appears that signals from the amygdala are essential for value-related calculations in other brain areas such as OFC and the nucleus accumbens .
7|Future experiments are needed to show unequivocally whether state value is initially calculated in the amygdala or passed to the amygdala from elsewhere , how inputs from many brain areas -- such as the dopaminergic midbrain -- might contribute to the value signal in the amygdala , and how intra-amygdalar processes might contribute to calculating state value .

9|Neural circuits within the amygdala regions , such as the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , and downstream targets such as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- , are critical neuroanatomical structures for orchestrating emotional behavioral responses that may influence motivated actions such as the reinstatement of drug seeking behavior .
9|Introduction The amygdala , located within the medial temporal lobe , is divided into at least 13 distinct subnuclei ; the most clearly defined being the basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , the lateral amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- , and the central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- -LRB- Amaral and Price 1984 ; Amunts et al. .
9|The CeA connects the amygdala proper with the extended amygdala , located between the amygdala and the nucleus accumbens -LRB- NAc -RRB- .
9|The extended amygdala is comprised of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis -LRB- BNST -RRB- as well as other interconnected nuclei such as the dorsal substantia innominata -LRB- Cassell et al. 1999 -RRB- .
9|Primary functions of the amygdala include emotional learning and regulation -LRB- Phelps and LeDoux 2005 -RRB- , memory formation -LRB- Packard and Cahill 2001 -RRB- , and reward processing © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. .
9|Human neuroimaging studies have provided strong evidence for the role of the amygdala and extended amygdala structures in drug and alcohol addiction .
9|A meta-analysis of data collected from fMRI and PET studies revealed that the amygdala and nucleus accumbens -LRB- NAc -RRB- , an area that receives dense innervation from the amygdala , show the most robust neural activation in response to drug-associated cues -LRB- Chase et al. 2011 -RRB- .
9|Changes in the amygdala have also been associated with alcohol use disorders .
9|An MRI study found that the amygdala is smaller in children of parents with alcohol use disorders -LRB- Hill et al. 2001 -RRB- .
9|Furthermore , gray matter is decreased in the medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- mPFC -RRB- , a region that receives strong innervation from the amygdala , in patients with alcohol use disorders -LRB- Pfefferbaum et al. 1998 -RRB- .
9|In this review we outline amygdala and BNST afferent and efferent connectivity , as well as animal studies that have implicated these circuits in the development and maintenance of drug addiction .
9|Role of BLA in addiction The amygdala is thought to be necessary for attributing emotional value to cues that predict salient events .
9|Immediate early genes are thought to represent changes in synaptic strength , suggesting that amygdala drive onto hippocampal neurons may modulate synapses necessary for processing aversive memories .
9|Collectively , these studies demonstrate that amygdalar modulation of the hippocampus is critical for both aversive and appetitive emotional memories , both of which can become pathological in drug addiction .
9|The infralimbic region of the mPFC also sends glutamatergic projections back to GABAergic cells of the CeA and to intercalated -LRB- ITC -RRB- cell masses within the amygdala , while the prelimbic region of the mPFC projects primarily to pyramidal cells in the BLA -LRB- Pare and Smith 1993 ; McDonald et al. 1996 -RRB- .
9|Studies in rats have shown that extinction of conditioned fear , a form of cognitive flexibility whereby a new learned association is formed that overrides a previous stimulus-driven behavioral response , depends on an intact mPFC -LRB- Morgan et al. 1993 ; Morgan and LeDoux 1995 ; Morgan and LeDoux 1999 -RRB- , and that communication between the amygdala and mPFC suppresses conditioned fear responses -LRB- Garcia et al. 1999 -RRB- .
9|Role of BNST in addiction The BNST is considered to be a connective center between stress regions , including the BLA , CeA , medial amygdala -LRB- MeA -RRB- and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus -LRB- PVN -RRB- , and brain reward centers , such as the ventral tegmental area -LRB- VTA -RRB- and nucleus accumbens -LRB- NAc -RRB- -LRB- Silverman et al. 1981 ; Brog et al. 1993 ; Georges and Aston-Jones 2001 ; Georges and Aston-Jones 2002 ; Jalabert et al. 2009 -RRB- .
9|However , subsequent studies have revealed that the duration of exposure to a learned cue regulates which part of the extended amygdala governs the expression of fear behavior .
9|Akin to CRF , several regions that express NPY have been shown to project to the BNST -LRB- for example the medial amygdala , CeA , and NTS -RRB- ; however , the BNST also contains NPY immunoreactive cells , which could release NPY locally -LRB- Sakanaka et al. 1986 ; Ishizaki et al. .
9|Highlights  We discuss basolateral amygdala circuitry and implications for drug addiction .
9| Dissecting the amygdala connectivity may be critical for further treatments for addiction .
9|Schematic detailing BNST afferent and efferent connectivity -LRB- A -RRB- The BNST receives inputs from the ventral tegmental area -LRB- VTA -RRB- , nucleus tractus solitaries -LRB- NTS -RRB- , dorsal raphe nucleus -LRB- DRN -RRB- , central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- , basolateral amygdala -LRB- BLA -RRB- , hippocampus -LRB- Hipp -RRB- , and prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- .
