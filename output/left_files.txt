10023948|The mean volume of the left amygdala-hippocampal complex -LRB- AHC -RRB- was lower in the first-episode group -LRB- 4.3 cm3 -LSB- 0.6 -RSB- -RRB- than in the high-risk group -LRB- 4.6 cm3 -LSB- 0.6 -RSB- -RRB- , and in turn than in the controls -LRB- 4.8 cm3 -LSB- 0.7 -RSB- -RRB- ; these differences were significant -LRB- p < 0.05 -RRB- both for absolute volumes and values adjusted for brain volume and other confounders .
10073475|In contrast , NMDA receptors in the left lateral amygdala mediate lasting suppression of risk assessment .
10073475|MK-801 , in a variety of sites in the left but not right lateral amygdala , blocked the effects of predator stress on risk assessment .
10073475|The data indicate that integrity of the left lateral amygdala is necessary for potentiation of startle amplitude by predator stress , though NMDA receptors are not involved in this function .
10073475|Nevertheless , NMDA receptors in the right , but not the left lateral amygdala , mediate initiation of changes in startle .
10073475|The data also suggest that the right amygdala action is `` downstream '' from the left amygdala contribution .
10075898|The left amygdala , a structure involved in implicit learning of visual representations , was activated by the categorization task on unknown faces .
10082808|In rats undergoing limbic seizure induced by 1 microgram intra-amygdaloid injection of KA , the post-injection latency of initial ictal discharges in the left amygdala was significantly longer in rats whose body temperature was lowered to 30 degrees C -LRB- 2.55 + / -0.94 min at 37 degrees C , 13.19 + / -5 .
10082808|14C-deoxyglucose autoradiograms showed decreased radiation density not only in the left amygdala and bilateral hippocampus , but also in the cerebral cortex of hypothermic rats .
10200226|During swallowing , group PET analysis identified increased regional cerebral blood flow -LRB- rCBF -RRB- -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- within bilateral caudolateral sensorimotor cortex -LSB- Brodmann 's area -LRB- BA -RRB- 3 , 4 , and 6 -RSB- , right anterior insula -LRB- BA 16 -RRB- , right orbitofrontal and temporopolar cortex -LRB- BA 11 and 38 -RRB- , left mesial premotor cortex -LRB- BA 6 and 24 -RRB- , left temporopolar cortex and amygdala -LRB- BA 38 and 34 -RRB- , left superiomedial cerebellum , and dorsal brain stem .
10202568|Activation in the region of the left amygdala/nucleus accumbens was found in PTSD patients only .
10213976|The SPM analysis demonstrated significant decrease of relative rCBF in the basal fore-brain area , the left hippocampus , the left amygdala , and the left parahippocampal area .
10219788|Discrimination between the direction of gaze significantly activated a region in the left amygdala during eye-contact and no eye-contact tasks to the same extent .
10219788|Results confirm that the left amygdala plays a general role in the interpretation of eye gaze direction , and that the activity of the right amygdala of the subject increases when another individual 's gaze is directed towards him .
10343969|nskoe@neuro.hfh.edu The messenger ribonucleic acid -LRB- mRNA -RRB- of gap junction protein connexin 43 was quantified in the tetanus toxin rat model of focal epilepsy following injection of toxin into the left amygdala .
10355673|We found that increasing intensity of sad facial expression was associated with enhanced activity in the left amygdala and right temporal pole .
10417248|Task-specific responses in left amygdala and left anterior cingulate were attenuated by tryptophan depletion .
10420552|Effects of novel or relevant -LRB- a single exposure to experimental chamber -RRB- and irrelevant -LRB- 20 exposures to experimental chamber -RRB- stimuli on the levels of serotonin -LRB- 5-HT -RRB- and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid -LRB- 5-HIAA -RRB- in the left and right hippocamp and amygdala were studied in male and female rats .
10420552|In females , an increase in 5-HT level was found in the left and right amygdalas in response to irrelevant stimulus .
10510979|Bipolar nichrome stimulation and recording electrodes were stereotaxically implanted into the right and left basolateral amygdala .
10517953|Similarly , DA alterations also were greater in the left medial amygdala in response to stressors .
10561935|Significant associations were found between left hippocampal volume and the immediate , delayed , and percent retention scores of the Logical Memory Test ; between the left mammillary body volume and the Logical Memory Test delayed and percent retention scores ; immediate Visual Reproduction performance was significantly related to the right and left amygdala volumes , and right mammillary body volume ; only the right amygdala and right mammillary body volume were associated with the delayed Visual Reproduction trial .
10618008|Relative to the cerebral volume differences , the regional volumes of the subjects with schizophrenia were 94 % in the left and right amygdala , 94 % in the left and 95 % in the right hippocampus/amygdala , and 93 % in the left and 95 % in the right parahippocampus .
10619632|Greater serotonin in the right versus left amygdala relates to greater anxiety .
10624542|RESULTS : There was a highly significant enlargement of left and right amygdala volumes in patients with dysthymia -LRB- right side , p < .000 ; left side , p = .001 -RRB- .
10624542|We found a significant positive correlation between left amygdala volumes -LRB- p = .02 -RRB- and a trend towards positive correlation between right amygdala volumes and depression -LRB- p = .06 -RRB- , as measured with the Beck Depression Inventory .
10648432|Another subgroup of aggressive patients -LRB- 28 % -RRB- had different left temporal lesions affecting either the amygdala or periamygdaloid structures .
10683827|Matching angry or frightened expressions was associated with increased regional cerebral blood flow -LRB- rCBF -RRB- in the left and right amygdala , the brain 's primary fear centers .
10694462|Second , we identified a left amygdala response sensitive to actual retrieval of emotional items .
10727625|On PD35 , concentrations of DA in the bilateral lateral amygdala and HVA in the left lateral amygdala were significantly increased in lesioned rats compared with sham-operated animals , while no significant change was observed in the other three brain areas .
10727625|On PD56 , in addition to the increased concentration of DA in the left lateral amygdala , those of DA , DOPAC and HVA in the caudate-putamen , and DA in the nucleus accumbens were found to be increased , but DA concentrations in the right medial prefrontal cortex were decreased .
10792453|The results showed that the parametric increase of winning was associated with left amygdala activation whereas the parametric increase of losing was associated with right amygdala activation .
10837507|However , several issues remain poorly understood : the separate roles of left and right amygdala , the time course over which the amygdala participates in memory consolidation , and the type of knowledge structures it helps consolidate .
10837507|Contrasts with both brain-damaged and normal control groups showed that subjects with left amygdala damage were impaired in their memory for emotional stimuli , despite entirely normal memory for neutral stimuli -LRB- because of a number of caveats , the findings from subjects with right amygdala damage were less clear -RRB- .
10843513|Good test-retest reliability was found in the left amygdala , right and left hippocampus , right and left thalamus , and right and left anterior caudate nucleus .
10863144|Male Sprague-Dawley rats were kindled from the left amygdala until they exhibited Racine 's class 5 generalized seizures -LSB- Racine -LRB- 1972 -RRB- .
10884445|RESULTS : Left amygdala-hippocampal volume was reduced in memory-impaired OHCA victims compared with control subjects -LRB- mean 3 .
10923682|Functional activation of the left amygdala and hippocampus during associative encoding .
10923682|Subtraction of the two conditions revealed greater activation within the left amygdala and hippocampus during paired face encoding , suggesting that associative encoding activates a left-lateralized limbic network including the hippocampus and amygdala .
10988036|Attribute-specific responses , independent of depth of processing , were evident in bilateral fusiform cortices for perceptual oddballs and left amygdala for emotional oddballs .
10989265|MDMA produced distributed changes in regional blood flow including increases in ventromedial frontal and occipital cortex , inferior temporal lobe and cerebellum ; and decreases in the motor and somatosensory cortex , temporal lobe including left amygdala , cingulate cortex , insula and thalamus .
11000199|The degree of activity in the left amygdala during encoding was predictive of subsequent memory only for scenes rated as most emotionally intense .
11050021|Notably , they did not activate a cortical ` face area ' when explicitly appraising expressions , or the left amygdala region and left cerebellum when implicitly processing emotional facial expressions .
11083167|The volume of the left amygdala was smaller in depressed subjects , and there was a trend for smaller left hippocampus in the 5 patients who had exhibited mild cognitive impairment .
11137053|Significant increases in rCBF across the group of all 10 patients were located in the prefrontal cortex -LRB- L > R -RRB- , the cingulate gyrus -LRB- L >> R -RRB- , and the left amygdala , as well as bilateral insula , basal ganglia , uncus , hippocampus , parahippocampus , thalamus , and cerebellum .
11137053|Significant decreases in flow were noted in small areas of the right prefrontal cortex , left medial temporal cortex , left basal ganglia , and left amygdala .
11137053|CONCLUSIONS : These data indicate that 2 weeks of daily 20-Hz rTMS over the left prefrontal cortex at 100 % MT induce persistent increases in rCBF in bilateral frontal , limbic , and paralimbic regions implicated in depression , whereas 1-Hz rTMS produces more circumscribed decreases -LRB- including in the left amygdala -RRB- .
11157556|Dissociation between ` theory of mind ' and executive functions in a patient with early left amygdala damage .
11157556|We report a patient , B.M. , with early or congenital left amygdala damage who , by adulthood , had received the psychiatric diagnoses of schizophrenia and Asperger 's syndrome .
11163282|Finally , during NREM sleep , the left amygdala and the left prefrontal cortex were more activated by stimuli having special affective significance than by neutral stimuli .
11172762|Consecutive 5-min samples -LRB- 2 microl/min infusion rate -RRB- were obtained from left amygdala and ipsilateral locus ceruleus complex -LRB- LC -RRB- under 3 experimental conditions lasting 1-h each -LRB- n = 12 samples per cat per condition -RRB- : -LRB- 1 -RRB- just before amygdala stimulation -LRB- baseline -RRB- , -LRB- 2 -RRB- during focal afterdischarge -LRB- AD -RRB- and -LRB- 3 -RRB- during generalized AD .
11209954|In contrast , the left amygdala was significantly more activated than the right to the contrast of fear vs happy .
11239901|RESULTS : Overall , we observed predominantly left amygdala and substantia innominata activity during the presentation of nonmasked fearful faces relative to fixation , and a decrease in activation in these regions with repeated exposure to the faces .
11239901|Adults showed increased left amygdala activity for fearful faces relative to neutral faces .
11241871|Time courses of left and right amygdalar responses to fearful facial expressions .
11241871|spmamlp@iop.kcl.ac.uk Despite the many studies highlighting the role of the amygdala in fear perception , few have examined differences between right and left amygdalar responses .
11241871|Initial observation of extracted time series of both amygdalae to these stimuli indicated more rapid decreases of right than left amygdalar responses to fearful faces , and increasing magnitudes of right amygdalar responses to neutral faces with time .
11241871|There was more significant nonstationarity of right than left amygdalar responses to neutral , and left than right amygdalar responses to fearful faces .
11241871|These findings indicate significant variability over time of both right and left amygdalar responses to fearful and neutral facial expressions and are the first demonstration of specific differences in time courses of right and left amygdalar responses to these stimuli .
11276236|Activation of the left amygdala to a cognitive representation of fear .
11276236|Using functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- , activation of the left amygdala was observed in response to threat versus safe conditions , which correlated with the expression of the fear response as measured by skin conductance .
11282362|All the rats then underwent stereotactic implantation of electrodes in the left amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- , left dorsal hippocampus -LRB- LdH -RRB- , left ventral hippocampus -LRB- LvH -RRB- , and the left sensorimotor cortex -LRB- LCx -RRB- .
11287374|Controls showed increased activity in the bilateral prefrontal and parietal cortex with increasing delay , whereas the patients had increased activity in the right prefrontal , anterior cingulate and left amygdala .
11287374|Increased activity in the right prefrontal cortex was associated with better memory performance in both groups and activity in the left amygdala was correlated with better performance in the patients .
11287374|Based on these task and behavioural effects , we examined functional connectivity of the right prefrontal cortex and left amygdala in both groups by determining those areas whose activity was correlated with activity in these regions .
11287374|Areas where activity was correlated with the left amygdala in patients included the bilateral posterior parahippocampal gyri , a number of left prefrontal regions , anterior and posterior cingulate , thalamus , and insula .
11287374|Controls had a relatively restricted set of regions where activity correlated with the left amygdala , mainly temporal and occipital areas .
11312562|The right and left basolateral amygdala and right frontal cortex were implanted with concentric bipolar electrodes .
11312562|Rats were kindled through a minimum of 10 stage 5 seizures by afterdischarge-threshold electrostimulation of the left amygdala , after which generalized seizure thresholds were determined prior to irradiation .
11312562|The left amygdala was exposed to single-fraction central-axis doses of either 18 or 25 Gy using a beam-collimated -LRB- 60 -RRB- Co source -LRB- 1.25 MeV -RRB- .
11325347|Discharges following ventral injections rapidly propagated to the left amygdala and sensorimotor cortex unlike seizures following dorsal injections .
11352610|Three distinct functional regions were identified within left amygdala : a UCS -LRB- noise -RRB- - related lateral region , a CS + - related ventral region , and a dorsal region where CS + - related responses changed progressively across the learning session .
11356489|Whereas pure tones activated auditory processing regions , subjects ' names additionally activated language centers as well as the left amygdala and prefrontal cortex .
11357132|Examination of patients with either left or right amygdala resections shows that the enhanced perception of aversive words depends specifically on the left amygdala .
11357132|All patients comprehend normally the affective meaning of the stimulus events , despite the lack of evidence for enhanced perceptual encoding of these events in patients with left amygdala lesions .
11409730|Using one-tailed tests , significant negative correlations were evident between pessimism scores , with low scores reflecting relatively more pessimism , and right -LRB- r = -0.60 ; p = 0.014 -RRB- and left amygdala rCBF -LRB- r = -0.53 ; p = 0.032 -RRB- .
11422325|The transition of psychotic symptoms corresponded to the changes in frequency and morphology of seizure discharges restricted to the left amygdala .
11422325|CONCLUSIONS : This case confirmed a close relationship between psychotic symptoms and seizure discharges in the left amygdala .
11430815|Activation of fusiform gyri by faces was strongly affected by attentional condition , but the left amygdala response to fearful faces was not .
11438606|Left amygdala rCBF covaried positively with recognition memory for food items , whereas rCBF in right anterior orbitofrontal cortex covaried with overall memory performance .
11438606|Regression analysis of the neuroimaging data revealed that left amygdala and right lateral orbitofrontal rCBF covaried as a function of stimulus category -LRB- i.e. , food vs non-food -RRB- .
11467919|Right neostriatum and left amygdala were activated when subjects made explicit judgements of disgust , bilateral orbitofrontal cortex when they made judgement of happiness , and right frontal and insular cortex when they made judgements about any emotion .
11468305|As predicted , the semantic dementia group showed more severe involvement of the temporal pole bilaterally and the left amygdala , parahippocampal gyrus -LRB- including the entorhinal cortex -RRB- , fusiform gyrus , and the inferior and middle temporal gyri .
11473792|peper@psychologie.uni-freiburg.de The present study applied a visual half field paradigm with emotional facial expressions in patients with selective unilateral amygdalo-hippocampectomy -LRB- AHE -RRB- to elucidate the contributions of the left and right medial temporal lobe and amygdala to emotional learning .
11494576|We obtained magnetic resonance -LRB- MR -RRB- spectra of the left and right amygdaloid-hippocampal regions and the left cerebellar hemisphere with a STEAM sequence -LRB- TR = 5000 ms , TE = 18 ms -RRB- .
11494576|Although no abnormal MR images were found in the three regions examined , the signal intensity and the concentration of NAA in the left amygdaloid-hippocampal region and the left cerebellar hemisphere were reduced significantly in autistic patients compared to normal children .
11495391|RESULTS : Using MRI , the areas that best separated groups were left hippocampal and left amygdala volume , resulting in correct classification -LRB- patient vs. control -RRB- in 79 % of cases -LRB- sensitivity 77 % , specificity 82 % -RRB- .
11496145|Happy faces produced greater right than left amygdala activation for males but not females .
11496145|Both sexes showed greater left amygdala activation for fearful faces .
11498423|Gender did not affect right-to-left amygdalar and hippocampal volume ratios in right - or left-handed participants .
11498423|CONCLUSION : Handedness , but not gender , seems to affect right-to-left amygdalar and hippocampal volume ratios .
11500598|RESULTS : With our VNS-fMRI methodology , the blood oxygenation level-dependent response to VNS was shown in brain regions regulated by the vagus nerve : orbitofrontal and parieto-occipital cortex bilaterally , left temporal cortex , the hypothalamus , and the left amygdala .
11513822|A region-of-interest analysis demonstrated differential change in BOLD signal in the right but not left amygdala across CS + versus CS - viewing .
11516444|Recognition of words presented in emotionally negative relative to emotionally neutral contexts was associated with enhanced activity in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , left amygdala and hippocampus , right lingual gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex .
11568425|Differential contribution of right and left amygdala to affective information processing .
11568425|Evidence for a differential involvement of the human left and right amygdala in emotional and cognitive behaviour is reviewed , with a particular emphasis on functional imaging results and case reports on patients with amygdalar damage .
11568425|The available evidence allows one to conclude that there is definitely a hemisphere specific processing difference between the left and right amygdala .
11568425|In spite of this , the following tentative proposals are made : the left amygdala is more closely related to affective information encoding with a higher affinity to language and to detailed feature extraction , and the right amygdala to affective information retrieval with a higher affinity to pictorial or image-related material .
11584919|Rats received 53 stimulations to the left basolateral amygdala in 1 conditional stimulus -LRB- CS -RRB- context -LRB- CS + -RRB- and 53 sham stimulations -LRB- the stimulation lead was attached but no current was delivered -RRB- in another context -LRB- CS - -RRB- , quasirandomly over 54 days .
11595264|Within encoding , the type of strategy produced different brain activity patterns , with deep encoding being characterized by left amygdala and left anterior cingulate activation .
11641537|Epileptic seizure was induced by injection of KA -LRB- 1 microg/microL -RRB- dissolved in phosphate buffer -LRB- 0.1 M , pH 7.4 -RRB- into the left amygdala .
11641538|Epileptic seizure was induced in rats by a single microinjection of KA -LRB- 1 microgram/microL -RRB- into the left amygdala .
11704071|Data were analyzed using left and right amygdala a priori regions of interest , in an analysis of variance block analysis and random effects model .
11704071|RESULTS : Depressed patients had exaggerated left amygdala activation to all faces , greater for fearful faces .
11704071|CONCLUSIONS : Depressed patients have left amygdala hyperarousal , even when processing stimuli outside conscious awareness .
11735840|RESULTS : Compared with healthy subjects , decreases in gray matter density were found in the left amygdala ; left hippocampus ; right supramarginal gyrus ; thalamus ; -LRB- orbito -RRB- frontal , -LRB- superior -RRB- temporal , occipitotemporal , precuneate , posterior cingulate , and insular cortices bilaterally in patients with schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder .
11735840|A group-by-age interaction for density was found in the left amygdala , owing to a negative regression slope of gray matter density on age in the left amygdala in patients compared with healthy subjects .
11735840|The decreased density in the left amygdala is more pronounced in older patients with schizophrenia .
11738542|Specifically , significant inverse correlations were found between -LRB- i -RRB- left amygdala and thought disorder , -LRB- ii -RRB- left hippocampus and negative symptoms , and -LRB- iii -RRB- left anterior and posterior hippocampus volumes and positive and negative symptoms , respectively .
11766778|For recording the electroencephalogram -LRB- EEG -RRB- , electrodes were placed in the left amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- , left dorsal hippocampus , and over the left sensorimotor cortex .
11772693|RESULTS : For Down 's syndrome , smaller volumes of the right and left amygdala , hippocampus , and posterior parahippocampal gyrus were significantly associated with greater age ; this association was not seen in the anterior parahippocampal gyrus .
11773432|tony-buchanan@uiowa.edu The amygdala is involved in the normal facilitation of memory by emotion , but the separate contributions of the left and right amygdala to memory for verbal or nonverbal emotional material have not been investigated .
11773432|Subjects with left amygdala damage failed to show the normally robust enhancement of memory for verbal and nonverbal emotional stimuli .
11773432|Furthermore , subjects with left amygdala damage were disproportionately impaired on memory for emotional narratives as compared with memory for emotional pictures .
11784442|The results of subtraction between the conditions showed that the left amygdala , right orbitofrontal cortex , and temporal cortices were predominantly involved in the processing of the negative expressions .
11784442|The correlation analysis showed that activity in the left amygdala positively correlated with activity in the left prefrontal cortex under the negative minus neutral subtraction condition .
11784442|The psychophysiological interaction revealed that the neural responses in the left amygdala and the right prefrontal cortex underwent the condition-specific changes between the negative and positive face conditions .
11784442|These results may suggest that the left and right amygdalae play a differential role in effective processing of facial expressions in collaboration with other cortical or subcortical regions , with the left being related with the bilateral prefrontal cortex , and the right with the right temporal lobe .
11801297|Predator stress appeared to potentiate right and depotentiate left hemisphere afferent amygdala transmission .
11801297|Potentiation in left hemisphere amygdala afferents and efferents predicts anxiolytic-like effects , while potentiation in the right hemisphere amygdala afferents predicts anxiogenic-like effects .
11816318|RESULTS : Subjects with depression demonstrated lower left amygdala Cho-Cr ratios , compared with control subjects -LRB- paired t = 2.624 , df 10 , P = 0.025 -RRB- .
11816318|Left amygdala NAA-Cr and right amygdala Cho-Cr and NAA-Cr did not differ significantly between subjects with depression and control subjects .
11816318|In subjects with depression , simple regression revealed a negative trend between left amygdala Cho-Cr and Beck Depression Inventory -LRB- BDI -RRB- score -LRB- F = 3.509 , P = 0.098 -RRB- .
11826070|Tasting QHCL significantly increased rCBF within the left amygdala relative to control conditions of tasting water and ECR .
11826070|These data indicate that the left amygdala responds robustly to QHCL and more moderately to nonaversive sapid stimuli , both pleasant and unpleasant gustatory stimuli activate the right posterior OFC , and the left inferior frontal pole/anterior OFC demonstrates valence-specific responses to aversive gustatory stimuli .
11830178|drevetsw@intra.nimh.nih.gov In a previous positron emission tomography -LRB- PET -RRB- study of major depression , we demonstrated that cerebral blood flow was increased in the left amygdala in unipolar depressives with familial pure depressive disease -LRB- FPDD -RRB- relative to healthy controls -LSB- J. Neurosci .
11830178|The left amygdala metabolism differed across groups -LRB- P < .001 -RRB- , being increased in both the FPDD and BD-D groups relative to the control group .
11830178|The left amygdala metabolism was positively correlated with stressed plasma cortisol levels in both the unipolar -LRB- r = .69 ; P < .005 -RRB- and the bipolar depressives -LRB- r = 0.68 ; .1 < P < .05 -RRB- .
11830178|The correlation between left amygdala metabolism and stressed plasma cortisol levels may conceivably reflect either the effect of amygdala activity on corticotropin-releasing hormone -LRB- CRH -RRB- secretion or the effect of cortisol on amygdala function .
11850152|Cocaine cues elicited a higher degree of craving than has been previously reported and resulted in left hemispheric activation of lateral amygdala , lateral orbitofrontal cortex , and rhinal cortex and right hemispheric activation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and cerebellum .
11879338|METHODS : Electrodes were implanted into the left amygdala of adult male Wistar rats .
11924878|Positive and negative emotional verbal stimuli elicit activity in the left amygdala .
11924878|Relative to neutral words , positive and negative emotional words elicited greater activity in the left amygdala .
11933997|The left amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex were activated during positive emotion , and bilateral amygdala activation occurred during negative emotion .
11996319|Rats received 30 stimulations and 30 sham stimulations -LRB- the lead was attached to the subjects but no current was delivered -RRB- to the left basolateral amygdala in a quasirandom sequence .
12026243|A suspected origin of seizures in the amygdala was supported by a high-resolution MRI showing a cortical dysplasia extending from the left anteromedial temporal lobe to the amygdala .
12086710|We carried out a systematic review of the published literature reporting left and right amygdala volumes from MRI in non-clinical subjects .
12086710|The mean + / -95 % confidence interval for the left amygdala volume was 1726.7 mm -LRB- 3 -RRB- + / -35.1 , and right was 1691.7 mm -LRB- 3 -RRB- + / -37.2 .
12091206|Paranoid and nonparanoid patients differed in left amygdala volume .
12099486|The results showed that both the predominant activation in young subjects and reduced activity in old subjects contributed to a significant age difference in the left amygdala during the perception of negative faces .
12099486|The dissociation with reduced activity in the left amygdala and the right parahippocampal gyrus may suggest that aging differentially affects neural responses to faces with negative or positive emotional valence .
12105126|No differences were found between the left and right amygdala .
12145327|Men activated significantly more structures than women in a network that included the right amygdala , whereas women activated significantly fewer structures in a network that included the left amygdala .
12165365|In this MR study we used a 3D shape representation technique , based on spherical harmonic functions , to analyze left and right amygdala-hippocampus shapes in each of 15 patients with schizophrenia and 15 healthy controls matched for age , gender , handedness and parental socioeconomic status .
12167256|In the first study , we examined the effects of amygdala lesions on affective traits in 10 left and 10 right amygdala-damaged patients , 1 patient with bilateral amygdala damage -LRB- SP -RRB- , and 20 control subjects .
12169253|In contrast , judgment of emotionally evocative , but non-moral statements activated the left amygdala , lingual gyri , and the lateral orbital gyrus .
12186475|METHODS : A single injection of kainate , an epileptogenic excitatory amino acid , into the left amygdala elicited chronic spontaneous recurrent seizure activity for at least 36 days after the injection .
12186475|Two weeks after the injection , infusion of ibotenate , a nonepileptogenic excitatory amino acid that is an axon-sparing neuronal cell toxin , into the left amygdala and piriform lobe induced immediate and permanent extinction of electrical and behavioral seizure activity .
12208011|Critically , fearful faces activated the left amygdala and extrastriate cortex both when seen and when extinguished ; as well as bilateral orbitofrontal and intact right superior parietal areas .
12218709|RESULTS : Treatment responders -LRB- defined by reduction in BDI score of > or = 30 % -RRB- had significantly less pretreatment blood flow in the left amygdala compared with nonresponders .
12244085|When individual profiles of amygdala atrophy were examined across patients and compared with control values , right amygdala atrophy was always accompanied by left amygdala atrophy , whereas patients with volume loss in the left amygdala could have normal or decreased right amygdala volumes .

12468016|At baseline , the mean metabolism was increased in the left and right lateral orbital cortex/ventrolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- PFC -RRB- , left amygdala , and posterior cingulate cortex , and decreased in the subgenual ACC and dorsal medial/dorsal anterolateral PFC in the unmedicated depressives relative to controls , consistent with the results of previous studies .
12468016|Following treatment , metabolism significantly decreased in the left amygdala and left subgenual ACC , and corresponding changes in the orbital and posterior cingulate cortices approached significance .
12482078|FE faces evoked specific responses in left anterior amygdala .
12482078|In addition , however , left amygdala displayed discriminatory responses to fearful eyes in different configural contexts -LRB- i.e. , in FF and FN faces -RRB- .
12482682|Additionally , they provide support for the hypothesis that , in this paradigm , emotional arousal enhances long-term memory for central information in men via activation of right amygdala/hemisphere function , and enhances long-term memory for peripheral details in women via activation of left amygdala/hemisphere function .
12552033|The mean total volumes of the right and left hippocampal formations and amygdala did not differ significantly between any of the three groups .

12667853|Correspondence between increased intensity of predominantly left sided amygdala activation and self-rating of sadness was found in 78 % of 120 sad trials , in contrast to only 14 % of neutral trials .
12705502|For the sample as a whole , amygdala volume correlated positively with age , and larger volumes of both the left and right amygdala were significantly associated with better performance on several cognitive tasks assessing academic skills and acquired knowledge in long-term memory .
12724169|We reviewed and reanalyzed data from our laboratory , indicating that subjective feelings of fear and distress are correlated with regional cerebral blood flow -LRB- rCBF -RRB- in the right but not the left amygdala during anxiety provocation in individuals with social anxiety disorder , specific phobias .
12752385|stevenb@interchange.ubc.ca Rats received 53 stimulations to either the left basolateral amygdala -LRB- BA -RRB- or left anterior neocortex -LRB- AN -RRB- in one environment -LRB- CS + -RRB- and 53 sham stimulations -LRB- the stimulation lead was attached but no current was delivered -RRB- in another environment -LRB- CS - -RRB- , quasirandomly over 54 days .

12810792|Left amygdala volume was significantly enlarged in patients with OCD but not in patients with schizophrenia versus the normal controls .
12810792|CONCLUSIONS : Non-specific hippocampal reduction in both the OCD and schizophrenic groups is likely to link to a clinical overlap between the two illnesses , whereas the left amygdala enlargement observed only in the OCD patients seems to be suggestive of a unique role for the amygdala in the pathophysiology of OCD .
12815023|Fischer-344 rats received cholesterol -LRB- inactive control -RRB- - , corticosterone - , or aldosterone-containing micropellets placed stereotaxically on the dorsal margin of the left and right amygdala -LRB- n = 10 for each group -RRB- .

12883925|Impulsiveness , personality disturbances and loss of emotional control were associated with decreased metabolism in the left amygdala .
12883925|In particular , they imply that the classically described symptoms of impaired behavioral control may be related to right orbitofrontal cortex hypometabolism whereas impaired regulation of emotions may result from a functional damage of the left amygdala .
12914972|In each dog , a cannula was stereotactically inserted into the left amygdala .

14531157|Trait and anticipatory-state anxiety were measured before and after left amygdala resection to control medically intractable epilepsy in the patients .
14531157|Lesions in the left amygdala resulted in decreases of trait and state anxiety , respiratory rate , and activity in the right amygdala in both patients ; one patient also showed notable decreases in skin conductance and heart rate .
14531157|We suggest that the activity of the right amygdala is dominantly activated in anxiety and anxiety-related physiological responses but needs excitatory inputs from the left amygdala .
14583744|These included a medial temporal cluster encompassing the left amygdala-hippocampal complex , extending into the hypothalamus , and a second cluster in the left posterior cingulate gyrus .
14586163|The left amygdala and right parahippocampal gyrus were activated by unpleasant words concerning body image relative to neutral words .
14597304|The patients were subdivided into two groups according to presence or absence of additional left amygdala pathology .
14597304|The additional presence of left amygdala sclerosis resulted in reorganisation for encoding of emotional verbal material to right amygdala .
14609882|Region of interest correlations showed that only patients with schizophrenia lacked a positive correlation between left temporal pole and left anterior amygdala-hippocampal complex gray matter volumes , whereas both psychosis groups were similar in lacking normal positive correlations between left temporal pole and left anterior superior temporal gyrus gray matter volumes .
14614086|There were two key findings : -LRB- 1 -RRB- impaired overall SCR after right amygdala damage ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- impaired correlation of SCR with the rated arousal of the stimuli after left amygdala damage .
14614086|Our results provide support for the hypothesis that the left and right amygdalae subserve different functions in emotion processing : the left may decode the arousal signaled by the specific stimulus , whereas the right may provide a global level of autonomic activation triggered automatically by any arousing stimulus .
14636317|METHODS : Male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with an electrode into the left amygdala .
14643096|RESULTS : Borderline patients showed significantly greater left amygdala activation to the facial expressions of emotion -LRB- vs. a fixation point -RRB- compared with normal control subjects .
14659478|Specifically , I hypothesize that the right hemisphere amygdala modulates right hemispheric processing of global/central aspects of a situation -LRB- an effect more pronounced in males -RRB- , while the left hemisphere amygdala modulates left hemispheric processing of more local/fine detail aspects of a situation -LRB- an effect more pronounced in females -RRB- .
14757593|Only MCVs exhibited rCBF increases in the left amygdala .

14758364|Encoding-related hippocampal activity for successfully remembered emotional items correlated with the degree of left amygdala pathology .
14970831|Mixed model analyses using age and total brain volume as time varying covariates indicated that left amygdala volume decreased significantly in patients following treatment .
14970831|The reduction in left amygdala volume in patients correlated significantly with higher paroxetine dosage at the time of the follow-up scan and total cumulative paroxetine exposure between the scans .
14970831|No significant changes in either right or left amygdala volume were evident among healthy comparison subjects from the baseline to the follow-up scan .
14979779|The relative contribution of left and right amygdalae in the acquisition and retention of fear conditioning was investigated in rats .
14979779|Although no left-right difference was observed to tone , the right amygdala lesions generated greater deficits in contextual fear than the left amygdala lesions .
14979779|These results indicate that fear conditioning is partially disrupted with unilateral amygdalar lesions , but that the right amygdala has greater involvement than the left amygdala when conditioning occurs under a normal brain state .
14980212|Relative to neutral faces , faces of intentional cooperators engendered increased activity in left amygdala , bilateral insula , fusiform gyrus , STS , and reward-related areas .
15004563|Sex differences were specific to the sexual nature of the stimuli , were restricted primarily to limbic regions , and were larger in the left amygdala than the right amygdala .
15027419|Those who reported increased fear showed right amygdala activation during the threat condition and left amygdala activation in the safe condition .
15039765|In adult rats , kainate was microinjected into the left amygdala to induce status epilepticus .
15050549|Conjunction analysis showed that masked affect perception , regardless of emotional valence , was associated with greater activation within the left amygdala and left anterior cingulate .

15066671|METHODS : An electrode and cannula complex was implanted in adult male Wistar rats , the electrode being targeted to the left basolateral amygdala .
15072680|Furthermore , subjects with right unilateral amygdala damage performed somewhat worse than subjects with left unilateral amygdala damage .
15076743|An increased fMRI signal was found in the left amygdala and adjacent anterior temporal regions in men , but not in women , during exposure to faces of the opposite versus the same sex .
15094258|Item 5 was negatively correlated with the left amygdala .
15130592|The left amygdala was highly activated in response to dynamic facial expressions relative to both control stimuli in the case of fearful expressions , but not in the case of happy expressions .
15132428|Collapsing across High and Low Recall conditions , -LRB- 1 -RRB- the PTSD group had higher rCBF in bilateral hippocampus and left amygdala than the Control group , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- within the PTSD group , symptom severity was positively associated with rCBF in hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus .
15145620|Most of these studies observed lateralized amygdala activity , indicative of a clear hemisphere-specific processing difference between the left and right amygdalae .
15145620|Because individual studies use varying paradigms and are limited by statistical power and sensitivity , it has remained unclear whether the left or the right amygdala is more consistently involved in emotional processing .
15145620|Our findings indicate that across studies , the left amygdala is more often activated than the right amygdala , suggesting different roles for the left and right amygdalae in emotional processing .
15145620|Further analysis showed that this predominant left amygdala activation is not significantly related to stimulus type , task instructions , differential habituation rates of the left and right amygdalae or elaborate processing .
15155523|These deficits held for subjects with either left or right early amygdala damage and encompassed the understanding of both the beliefs and emotional states of others .
15169855|The results demonstrate a significantly stronger relationship in men than in women between activity of the right hemisphere amygdala and memory for those slides judged as arousing , and a significantly stronger relationship in women than in men between activity of the left hemisphere amygdala and memory for arousing slides .
15178947|These patients underwent T -LRB- 1 -RRB- - weighted MRI imaging , and gray matter volumes for right and left orbitofrontal lobes and amygdalas were derived via segmentation and region of interest tracing , normalizing for total intracranial volume .
15179796|Brain MRI demonstrated left frontal lobe -LRB- orbital cortex and dorso-lateral surface -RRB- contusions , severe atrophy in the left temporal cortex including the hippocampus and amygdala , and diffuse axonal injury in the left frontal white matter .
15193632|The left amygdala showed the interaction between emotional expression and face direction , indicating higher activity for angry expressions looking toward the subjects than angry expressions looking away from them .
15193632|Regression analysis showed a positive relation between the left amygdala activity and experienced emotion .
15195286|Antidepressant drug effects in left amygdala and ventral striatum were detected by this software for an interaction between time -LRB- within-subject factor -RRB- and group -LRB- between-subject factor -RRB- in a representative two-way factorial design .
15254095|Although there were no differences between groups in terms of total cerebral volume , children with autism -LRB- 7.5-12 .5 years of age -RRB- had larger right and left amygdala volumes than control children .
15257156|Predominant BOLD signal change to the contrasts of infants minus neutral stimulus occurred in bilateral visual processing regions -LRB- BA 19,21,37,38 -RRB- ; to own infant minus unknown infant in right anterior temporal pole -LRB- BA 38 -RRB- , left amygdala and visual cortex -LRB- BA 19 -RRB- , and to the unknown infant minus own infant contrast in bilateral orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- BA 10,47 -RRB- and medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- BA 8 -RRB- -LSB- corrected -RSB- These findings suggest that amygdala and temporal pole may be key sites in mediating a mother 's response to her infant and reaffirms their importance in face emotion processing and social behaviour .
1527602|Based upon the connectivity between these portions of the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala and evidence that the amygdala is involved in emotional modulation , activity was measured in the left amygdala and found to be significantly increased in the depressed group .
1527602|Both the depressed and the remitted groups demonstrated increased activity in the left amygdala , though this difference achieved significance only in the depressed group .
1527602|This suggests that the abnormality involving the left amygdala may represent a trait marker of FPDD , though further assessment in a larger sample size is necessary to establish this .
15276825|bhettrs@umdnj.edu The present study sought to determine the effects of kindled seizures generated from the left and right amygdala upon weight gain in rat .
15276825|The results demonstrated that kindling from either the left or right amygdala induced significant increases in weight gain relative to the control rats .
15276825|However , kindling from the left basal amygdala induced increases in body weight that were four times greater than control rats and two times greater than the rats kindled from the right side of the basal amygdala .
15276825|Likewise , serum leptin levels , which were highly correlated with weight gain , also showed significantly greater increases in left amygdaloid kindled rats relative to rats kindled from the right amygdala and control rats .
15289278|Also , in controls , an inverse relationship was demonstrated between regional cerebral blood flow changes during anger induction in the left ventromedial prefrontal cortex and left amygdala , whereas in patients with MDD + A there was a positive correlation between these brain regions during anger induction .

15364037|Furthermore , there was a direct correlation between left amygdala volumes and age -LRB- r = .
15364037|CONCLUSIONS : The direct correlation between left amygdala volumes and age in bipolar patients , not present in healthy control subjects , may reflect abnormal developmental mechanisms in bipolar disorder .
15381027|Compared to controls , participants with TS demonstrated significantly larger left amygdala gray matter volumes , irrespective of total cerebral tissue and age .
15382260|We show that there is greater activity for successful encoding of associative information than for non-associative information in the right hippocampal region , as well as in the left amygdala and right parahippocampal cortex .

15598548|There was a trend towards smaller left amygdala volumes in all depressed patients compared with healthy controls .
15598549|Regression analyses demonstrated that state anxiety was correlated with activity in left amygdala , bilateral perirhinal cortex , right FG , and periaquaductal grey ; by contrast , phobic fear was only associated with right-sided hippocampal activity .
15601600|RESULTS : Across both groups , there was significant activation in left and right amygdala for the fearful versus neutral faces contrast .

15828421|In hungry animals , in a greater number of cases -LRB- 52 % -RRB- , the discharge of a neuron in the left amygdala was the first in a pair , and the discharge of the right neuron was delayed -LRB- peaks from 10 to 50 and from 130 to 150 ms -RRB- .
15828421|When a rabbit saw a dog , the number of common inputs to neurons increased and the leading role of the right amygdalar neurons grew -LRB- 57 % -RRB- due to an increase in inhibitory influences from the right to the left amygdala .
15850729|Intraclass correlation coefficients calculated across the sessions indicated stability of response in left amygdala to fearful faces -LRB- as a change from baseline -RRB- , but considerably less left amygdala stability in responses to neutral expressions and for fear versus neutral contrasts .

15947057|Left amygdala activation is more closely associated with cognitive processing and differentiation of facial emotions .
15947057|A double-dissociation between the functions of left and right amygdala is implied by lesion studies but supportive evidence is inconsistent , partly because patients with structural anteromedial temporal anomalies have experienced variable surgical procedures .
15947057|There was a significant correlation between the left fusiform and left medial amygdala activation only in normal females , and only in them did differential SCRs -LRB- to fearful-neutral faces -RRB- correlate positively with left fusiform responses .
15947057|X-monosomy selectively impairs explicit recognition of fearful faces in the presence of normal or enhanced autonomic reactivity , and is associated with a functional dissociation of activity in left amygdala and left fusiform gyrus .
15961229|Analysis of group , condition , and hemisphere revealed a significant three-way interaction , with right greater than left habituation in the young , but left greater than right amygdala habituation in the elderly .
15961347|At the interplay of emotion , memory , dream , and temporal lobe seizure , we report on a patient with a left dysplastic amygdala and temporal lobe epilepsy who presented with a typical seizure while dreaming .
15997014|With a less conservative statistical threshold , additional gray matter reductions were found in the left accumbens and left amygdala .

16012281|The post hoc conjunctional analyses demonstrated that BA - subjects activated the left ACC , left insula , left ATP -LRB- BA 21 -RRB- , left ATP -LRB- BA 38 -RRB- , left amygdala , and right medial prefrontal cortex .
16038681|Compared to controls , PTSD subjects showed enhanced responses to targets in the dorsal and rostral anterior cingulate , and left amygdala .
16038681|Activation in rostral and dorsal anterior cingulate , left amygdala and posterior parietal networks in response to salient , nonthreatening stimuli may reflect generalized hypervigilance .
16060926|METHODS : Rats were implanted in the left amygdala and were fully kindled .
16081303|By contrast , females showed persistent bilateral amygdala responses , with a tendency towards greater left amygdala engagement during the late phase .
16129558|Results demonstrated that following 60 stimulations of the left basolateral amygdala over a 4-week period , male Long-Evans rats exhibited decrements in every aspect of sexual behavior .
16139812|RESULTS : Phobics showed greater responses to spiders versus mushrooms in the left amygdala , left insula , left anterior cingulate gyrus -LRB- ACC -RRB- , and left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- DMPFC -RRB- during the identification task and in the left and right amygdala during the distraction task .
16140346|ASD participants also failed to show modulation of left amygdala activity during imitation that was evident in the controls .
16140590|Adult rats were electrically stimulated in the left amygdala to induce SE , which was stopped 2 hours later .
16143545|The left and right amygdalae responded to both the emotion and the identity matching condition , and the only selective response to emotion matching was at the left inferior prefrontal sulcus .
16143545|The left amygdalar response habituated to emotion matching but not to identity matching .
16143545|We concluded that the amygdalar response to face matching is driven at least in part by relevance detection , independent of emotion processing , although there appears to be additional emotion-specific processing at the left amygdala .
16148238|Finally , patterns of covariance are remarkably consistent between males and females , with the exception of the left amygdala , which is positively associated with the left and right anterior inferior temporal cortex in males and with the right angular gyrus in females .
16165102|RESULTS : Comparison of the brain activation upon performing the fat-image task versus real-image task showed significant activation of the bilateral prefrontal cortex and left parahippocampal area including the amygdala in the women , and significant activation of the right occipital lobe including the primary and secondary visual cortices in the men .
16197694|Damage to either the left or right amygdala was associated with impairment in the recognition of both social and cognitive expressions , despite an intact ability to extract information relating to invariant physical attributes .
16204201|An interaction between emotional encoding context and accuracy of source memory revealed that successful retrieval of emotional context was associated with activity in left amygdala , and a left frontotemporal network including anterior insula , prefrontal cortex and cingulate .
16204204|Wistar rats were kindled through daily administration of brief electrical stimulations to the left basolateral nucleus of the amygdala .
16213471|There were trend-level differences in the left amygdala volume in the manual tracing method among the three groups .
16213471|The left amygdala volumes in the subjects with a first minor and/or major depressive episode were significantly smaller than in those with no history of any depressive episode .
16216534|PTSD subjects also showed a small but significant enhancement in left amygdala activity , most apparent during the Late phase , but reduction in Early right amygdala response .
16226389|METHODS : Mice were implanted with bipolar electrodes in the left amygdala and given electrical stimulation -LRB- 3 s , 100 Hz , 1 ms monophasic square wave pulses every 5 min , 40 in total -RRB- while being observed and graded for the development of seizures .
16249100|The left amygdala and the right anterior temporal pole were activated during the Attending task , whereas activation was observed in the left lateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- LPFC -RRB- , including the adjacent medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- MPFC -RRB- , and medial orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- MOFC -RRB- during the Suppression task .
1625526|The contents of NA and DA in right and left amygdala decreased significantly in lesioned animals with respect to sham lesioned animals , but hypothalamic levels were not different between groups .
16269094|Left auditory cortex and amygdala , but right insula dominance for human laughing and crying .
16272876|Extraversion was positively correlated with gray matter concentration in the left amygdala , whereas neuroticism was negatively correlated with gray matter concentration in the right amygdala .
16317710|There was a positive correlation between intensity ratings and blood oxygenation level-dependent -LRB- BOLD -RRB- signals in the left amygdala .
16318368|Magnetic resonance imaging showed low intensity areas -LRB- left posterior limb of internal capsule , left cerebral peduncle of middle brain , a part of left substantia nigra , left amygdala , ventral posterior lateral nucleus and ventral anterior nucleus of left thalamus , left lateral geniculate body , and left occipital lobe -RRB- in T1 weighted image , due to the infarct in the left anterior choroidal artery territory .
16326115|In contrast , the left amygdala was associated with greater functional connectivity in women than in men .
16326115|Furthermore , the regions displaying stronger functional connectivity with the right amygdala in males -LRB- sensorimotor cortex , striatum , pulvinar -RRB- differed from those displaying stronger functional connectivity with the left amygdala in females -LRB- subgenual cortex , hypothalamus -RRB- .
16330500|Significant genotype-diagnosis interaction effects on brain morphology were noted in the left ACC , the left parahippocampal gyrus and the left amygdala-uncus .
16330500|Schizophrenics homozygous for the Val-COMT showed a significant reduction of volumes in the bilateral ACC , left amygdala-uncus , right MTG and left thalamus compared to Met-COMT schizophrenics .
16368249|Across subjects , the left amygdala was activated by each face condition separately , and its response was not selective for any particular emotion category .
16380239|We hypothesized : -LRB- 1 -RRB- baseline perfusion in right and left amygdalae will be greater in responders than in nonresponders ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- following partial sleep deprivation -LRB- PSD -RRB- , perfusion in responders ' right and left amygdalae would decrease .
16411179|In the fMRI experiment , this shift in rating of facial expressions in presence of a fearfully spoken sentence was correlated with the hemodynamic response in the left amygdala extending into the periamygdaloid cortex , which suggests that crossmodal effects on cognitive judgments of emotional information are mediated via these neuronal structures .
16411179|Presumably , these increased extrastriate activations correspond to enhanced alertness , whereas responses within the left amygdala modulate cognitive evaluation of emotional facial expressions .
16461862|Controls without PTSD activated the left amygdala in response to aversive stimuli .
16465484|Linkage of neuron spike activity in the right and left amygdala in food motivation and emotional tension .
16465484|pavlovfml@atom.ru Cross-correlation histograms were plotted to study the linkage of spike activity in simultaneously recorded neurons in the central nucleus of the right and left amygdala in rabbits in calm waking , after 24 hours of food deprivation , in satiation , and in emotional tension -LRB- on presentation of dogs -RRB- .
16465484|In hunger , many cases -LRB- 52 % -RRB- showed pairs in which the first neuron to discharge was in the left amygdala , this being followed by a neuron in the right amygdala -LRB- peaks from 10-50 and 130-150 msec -RRB- .
16465484|On presentation of dogs , there was an increase in the number of cases showing a common input to neurons , along with an increase in the leading role of neurons in the right amygdala -LRB- 57 % -RRB- , due to increases in inhibitory influences from this area on cells in the left amygdala .
16475485|T2-weighted cranial MRI indicated hyperintensity of the left amygdala as well as hyperintensity and atrophy of bilateral basal ganglia .
16476409|There was a significant correlation in BPD patients between left amygdala volume and depressive symptoms as measured by HAMD .
16503120|METHODS : Rats were implanted with a left amygdala electrode and were stimulated until reaching stage 1 .
16510224|Activation of the left and right amygdala in response to the masked fearful faces -LRB- compared to neutral faces -RRB- was significantly correlated with the number of fearful faces detected .
16510224|In addition , right but not left amygdala activation in response to the masked angry faces was significantly related to the number of angry faces detected .
16571552|BIZ ratings were not significantly correlated with either the left or right anterior hippocampus or amygdala volumes .
16575552|Additional increases were observed in the left amygdala/parahippocampal gyrus , a structure also involved in emotional arousal .
16603133|In an analysis comparing successful vs. unsuccessful face encoding , MDD patients exhibited greater left amygdala activation relative to healthy and anxious youth .
16638081|The removal of this marked neuroanatomical region and the resulting disconnection and asymmetry between right and left amygdala-hippocampal region might be seen as an evidence for this region aetiologically being involved in the patient 's PTSD symptoms .
16644742|Correlation analysis demonstrated that decreases in Y-BOCS and HAM-D with anterior capsular electrostimulation were inversely related to the metabolic activity changes in the left ventral striatum , left amygdala , and left hippocampus -LRB- P < 0.01 -RRB- .
16649818|Neurally , in the SCZ-SU group , significant loci of activation were identified in the right medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- Brodmann 's area -LSB- BA -RSB- 10 -RRB- , left medial prefrontal cortex -LRB- BA 10 -RRB- , right orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- BA 47 -RRB- , and left amygdala .
16670653|RESULTS : After covarying for whole brain volume , children with VCFS exhibited 11 % greater volume of the left amygdala -LRB- p = .002 -RRB- and 8 % greater volume of the right amygdala -LRB- p = .01 -RRB- .
16682795|In cases homozygous for the epsilon4 allele -LRB- n = 8 -RRB- versus noncarriers , the greatest atrophy was located in the right amygdala followed by the right parahippocampal gyrus , the left amygdala and the left medial dorsal thalamic nucleus .
16730374|Meta-analyses also found significantly smaller left amygdala volumes in adults with PTSD compared to both healthy and trauma-exposed controls , and significantly smaller anterior cingulate cortex compared to trauma-exposed controls .
16735472|Also , compared with controls , patients had greater activation in the left amygdala , accumbens , putamen , and ventral prefrontal cortex when rating face hostility , and greater activation in the left amygdala and bilateral accumbens when rating their fear of the face .
16740316|Correlation analyses revealed that larger left amygdala volumes were significantly related to worse memory performance and to higher anxiety scores of depressive subjects .
16754842|CONCLUSIONS : Larger right amygdalar volume at 3 and 4 years of age , but not left amygdalar , hippocampal , or total cerebral volume , is associated with a more severe clinical course and worse outcome at age 6 years in children with autism spectrum disorder .
16762327|Rats were kindled to stage 5 by afterdischarge-threshold electrostimulation of the left amygdala .
16762327|Treatment groups were irradiated using a collimated X-ray beam -LRB- 18 MV -RRB- either prior to kindling , at kindling stage 3 , or at kindling stage 5 , by exposure of the left amygdala to a single-fraction central-axis dose of 25 Gy .
16806312|The controls showed greater activation in the left amygdala and left orbito-frontal cortex , while the HFA/AS group showed greater activation in the anterior cingulate gyrus and superior temporal cortex .
16806312|The control group also showed varying responses in social brain areas to varying intensities of fearful expression , including differential activations in the left and right amygdala .
16837173|These regions corresponded with left frontopolar gyrus , left amygdala , globus pallidus and nucleus accumbens , and left superior temporal gyrus .
16859420|Critically , a direct comparison between both stages revealed that whereas the right amygdala was involved in emotional memory formation , the retrieval of those memories relied on the left amygdala .
16880223|We assessed the effects of direct electric stimulations in either the right or the left amygdala on verbally self-reported emotions -LRB- Izard scale -RRB- and on psychophysiological markers of emotions by recording skin conductance responses -LRB- SCRs -RRB- and by measuring the electromyographic responses of the corrugator supercilii -LRB- EMGc -RRB- .
16880223|In contrast , stimulations of the left amygdala were able to induce either pleasant -LRB- happiness -RRB- or unpleasant -LRB- fear , anxiety , sadness -RRB- emotions .
16891125|The presence of an audience was associated with increased left amygdala activity across all conditions .
16908199|Subjective emotion -LRB- present both during and after aversive pictures -RRB- was temporally associated with activation in the right lateral OFC and left hippocampus but not the amygdala .
1691672|DOPAC levels were not significantly increased in the frontal cortex , left amygdala or striatum .
16950220|In the left amygdala no significant differences were found between phobic and non-phobic conditions .
16963565|We found that previously reported sex differences of memory associations with left amygdala for women and with right amygdala for men were confined to the ventral amygdala during picture viewing and delayed memory .
16972100|RESULTS : Results indicated significant negative associations between degree of left amygdala activation and measures of posttreatment symptom improvement in the group , as a whole .
17010993|Hamilton depression scores of the patients correlated positively with activation of the left and right ventral amygdala during expectation of negative stimuli .
17030660|On average , the left amygdala was 39 % smaller in semantic dementia than in frontal variant FTLD , whereas the right amygdala was only 1 % smaller .
17064731|Moreover the four DBT responders displayed reduction of HRF modulation in the left amygdala and both hippocampi .
17069470|A parametric analysis showed that the left amygdala was activated in relation to subjective amusement .
17070072|For the identification task trials , increased responses of the left amygdala to CS + versus CS - were rapidly established but absent at the end of the conditioning trials .
17113049|Volume of left amygdala subregion predicted temperamental trait of harm avoidance in female young subjects .
17113049|When the score on the harm avoidance -LRB- HA -RRB- subscale was used as a dependent variable , the multiple regression analysis revealed that the HA score positively correlated with the volume of the part of left amygdala .
17131586|Across these experiments we found : i -RRB- behaviorally a strong emotional word effect in the left visual field -LRB- right hemisphere - RH -RRB- of normals , correlating well with the emotional word performance of aphasic patients , pointing to a specific role of the right hemisphere ; ii -RRB- electro-physiologically a specific early -LRB- 100-140 msec -RRB- brain response to emotional words during scalp recordings in healthy subjects subsequent to right visual field -LRB- left hemisphere - LH -RRB- stimulation , that source localization procedures project to posterior areas of the right hemisphere ; iii -RRB- preliminary data of a very early -LRB- 60 msec -RRB- activation of the left amygdala in a depth-recorded epileptic patient when the same emotional words were presented to the right visual field -LRB- left hemisphere -RRB- ; and iv -RRB- a consistent gender difference showing that the above findings might be relevant for men only .
17131586|We propose that the left amygdala via extrastriate connections acts as a detector of emotional word content at a very early stage of processing ; that this amygdala response subsequently modulates the cortical response to emotional words asymmetrically , rendering the left visual cortex less sensitive to emotional words than that of the right hemisphere ; and that this modulation is gender dependent .
17156697|The correlation between anxious/depressed symptoms and left amygdala volume did not reach statistical significance -LRB- r = .249 , P = .112 -RRB- .
17215168|Significant positive relationships were noted between right and left amygdala volumes and depression .
17215168|These findings indicate that both right and left amygdala volumes are associated with depression severity among persons with TLE .
17251241|In both patient groups , left anterior temporal damage extended into the amygdala .
17280513|Results indicated that faster judgments of negative relative to neutral information were associated with increased left and right amygdala activation .
1729402|During the development of kindling by daily electrical stimulations applied to the left amygdala of rats , concentrations of the polyamines putrescine , spermidine , and spermine were measured in the left amygdala and the remainder of the cerebrum .
1729402|A significant increase of putrescine concentration appeared first at the left amygdala in prekindled rats and then propagated to the remainder of the cerebrum with the development of kindling .
1729402|This increase in putrescine concentration in the left amygdala was higher in prekindled rats than in fully kindled rats and lasted for at least 24 h after the final kindling stimulation .
1729402|Pretreatment with alpha-difluoromethylornithine -LRB- 50 nmol -RRB- for 10 days accelerated both the development of behavioral kindling and the propagation of the afterdischarge from the left amygdala to the frontal cortex .
17295979|The dissociation of neural circuits responsible for processing facial expressions is discussed and , especially , the role of the left amygdala to discriminate between facial expressions .
17306772|RESULTS : Subjects with FH - had robust activation to the faces in the region of the right and left amygdalar complexes -LRB- p 's < .05 -RRB- , while subjects with FH + had no such activation -LRB- p 's > .46 -RRB- .
17313824|No significant differences were found in the mRNA and protein expression of Kv 4.2 , Kv4 .3 , and KChIP1 between left and right amygdala in any groups .
17350290|In the ROI analysis , the left ventro-medial frontal cortex , right medial superior frontal gyrus , anterior insulae and left amygdala/hippocampus showed significant longitudinal changes .
17375193|In the left amygdala , mean response magnitude in the core area of LB with 90-100 % assignment probability was significantly larger than in the core areas of SF and CM .
17397999|tebartzvanelst@uniklinik-freiburg.de In order to detect possible links between structural and neurochemical brain abnormalities we applied high resolution morphometric imaging and short-echo time absolute-quantification magnetic resonance spectroscopy -LRB- MRS -RRB- at the left hand side to the amygdala in 12 patients with borderline personality disorder -LRB- BPD -RRB- and 10 group-matched healthy controls .
17397999|In addition there was a significant 17 % increase of left amygdalar creatine concentrations in BPD patients .
17397999|Left amygdalar creatine concentration correlated positively with measures of anxiety and negatively with amygdalar volume .
17434455|Both patient groups showed reduced activation in MPFC and the left amygdala -LRB- compared with HC -RRB- for neutral pictures -LRB- compared with blank condition -RRB- , although this effect could be explained by medication .
17443901|METHODS : Different volumes of saline were injected into the right or left cPC of amygdaloid-kindled rats , and its effect on generalized seizures was observed .
17467670|Seizure susceptibility and neurodegeneration induced by microinjection of kainic acid -LRB- KA -RRB- into the left amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- in C57BL/6 and FVB/N mouse strains were compared .
17473836|During faces processing Epo enhanced activation in the left amygdala and right precuneus to happy and fearful expressions .
17491609|In patients with mood disorders , it has been reported that the left amygdaloid complex presents a lesser volume .
1751619|Only in the schizophrenic group was P300 latency correlated negatively with the area of the right and left cingulate cortex and positively with the difference in size between the right and left amygdala .
1751619|In the subgroup of schizophrenic subjects whose P300 latency was greater than 2 standard deviations above the control mean , the area of the left cingulate cortex was significantly smaller than in controls , and the absolute right-left difference in the area of the amygdala was significantly increased .
17553706|Grey matter volume in bilateral anterior insular cortex and the left amygdala was significantly reduced in CD patients compared to healthy control subjects .
17554005|Presentation of the cue in either threat condition was associated with increased CBF in the left amygdala .
17566766|Structures related to evaluation of threat , left amygdala and right insula , also showed increased activity to stimulus deviance under threat .
17566766|As anxiety level increased across participants , right and left auditory cortical as well as right amygdala activity increased to stimulus deviance .
17585888|Activation during successful inhibitory events in bilateral inferior frontal and left amygdala , insula , and nucleus accumbens and during unsuccessful inhibition -LRB- commission errors -RRB- in rostral anterior cingulate predicted post-treatment improvement in depression symptoms .
17588776|While expecting unpleasant stimuli , the `` cognitive control '' group showed higher activity in left medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex areas but reduced activity in the left extended amygdala , pulvinar/lateral geniculate nucleus and fusiform gyrus .
17604649|The level of reported anxiety during the exposure to slim bodies correlated with established measures of shape and weight concern and with brain activations in bilateral basal ganglia , left amygdala , bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate , and left inferior lateral prefrontal cortex .
1760726|Kindling stimulations were applied to the left amygdala .
17607327|Activation in the left insula , left amygdala and hippocampus , and rostral anterior cingulate cortex showed an effect of selectively attending to the vocal stimuli .
17614213|Female non-epileptic wistar rats 10-13 weeks of age were implanted with a bipolar electrode into the left amygdala .
17660265|Statistical parametric mapping -LRB- SPM -RRB- of FDG uptake using SPM2 at a statistical threshold of P < 0.005 showed increased FDG uptake in left amygdala in hypoglycemia awareness , but not in hypoglycemia unawareness -LRB- region of interest analysis -0.40 + / - 1.03 vs. 3.66 + / - 0.42 , respectively ; P = 0.007 -RRB- , and robust increase in bilateral ventral striatum during hypoglycemia -LRB- region of interest analysis hypoglycemia unawareness 3.52 + / - 1.02 vs. awareness 6.1 + / - 0.53 ; P = 0.054 -RRB- .
17688985|Previous studies examining neural responses to emotional stimuli in individuals with major depressive disorder -LRB- MDD -RRB- have indicated increased responses within the left amygdala to sad faces , and increased activity within the visual cortex and striatum to expressions of happiness .
17688985|However , within the MDD group , the severity of depression correlated with the activity of the left amygdala , bilateral inferior orbitofrontal areas , and the left insula to negative pictures , whereas there were no clear indications of association between specific cerebral regions and positive pictures .
17688985|Our findings indicate that preferential decreases in the left amygdala in response to negative pictures might be involved in the processing of emotional stimuli in depressed individuals .
17688985|Also , these findings suggest that the bilateral inferior orbitofrontal cortices and left amygdala may be preferentially recruited in MDD patients , but not in healthy individuals .
17699669|Furthermore , during an effortful affective reappraisal task , nondepressed individuals showed an inverse relationship between activation in left ventrolateral PFC and the amygdala that is mediated by the ventromedial PFC -LRB- VMPFC -RRB- .
17712272|Using synthetic aperture magnetometry in the analysis of MEG data , we identified a left amygdala power increase in the theta frequency range during priming involving negative words .
17715358|Region of interest analyses demonstrated a significant negative correlation between fMRI signal change in the left amygdala and 5-HTT availability in the left amygdala , with 5-HTT availability accounting for approximately 42 % of the variability in left amygdala activity .
17716795|Reductions of gray matter concentration in patients to controls were observed in bilateral insula , bilateral superior temporal gyri and left amygdala .
17728113|Finally , we found a correlation between left amygdalar volume and the recognition of sadness in facial expressions .
17762711|Citalopram enhanced the BOLD signal response in the left posterior insula -LRB- together with nonprespecified pulvinar and visual cortex -RRB- but attenuated activation in the left amygdala to disgusted faces and right amygdala activation to fearful faces .
17870235|Namely , the left amygdala was more active for successfully remembered female fearful faces in women , whereas in men the right amygdala was more involved in memory for male fearful faces .
17918712|The females showed activation both in the left and the right amygdala , greater in the former than in the latter -LRB- -LSB- 220.52 + / - 17.09 -RSB- mm3 vs. -LSB- 155.45 + / - 18.34 -RSB- mm3 , P < 0.05 -RRB- , but in the males only the left amygdala was activated .
17949901|There were no statistically significant differences in mean volumes for left or right amygdala .
17987064|We explored this hypothesis by mapping the functional coupling of right and left amygdalae in functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired from 19 patients with major depressive disorder and 19 healthy volunteers , each scanned twice -LRB- at baseline and 8 weeks later -RRB- during performance of an implicit facial affect processing task .
17987064|Treatment-related increases in functional coupling to frontal and other regions were greater for the left amygdala than for the right amygdala .
17987064|These results indicate that antidepressant drug effects can be measured in terms of altered coupling between components of cortico-limbic systems and that these effects were most clearly demonstrated by enhanced functional coupling of the left amygdala .
17987655|Mood disorder following DBS of the left amygdaloid region in a dystonia patient with a dislodged electrode .
17987655|He developed remarkable behavioral complications and was found to have dislodgement of the left electrode to a position close to the left amygdala .
17987655|We describe in detail the clinical features associated with left amygdala dysregulation induced by high-frequency stimulation through the displaced electrode .
17988837|In both sexes , right hippocampi were larger than left , while left amygdala were larger than right .
17996813|In contrast , signal changes in insula , left SII cortices and right amygdala did correlate with pain ratings and are therefore likely to encode for pain intensity .
17999745|For epileptogenesis experiments , separate cohorts of rats , similarly exposed to either early life MS or EH , were implanted with bipolar electrodes into the left amygdala and one week later rapid electrical kindling performed until fully kindled -LRB- five Class V seizures , Racine scale -RRB- .
18003631|However , boys with SZ had smallest left amygdala and girls with BPD had the smallest left hippocampal volumes .
18004139|The functional connectivity analysis revealed only a change of correlated activations between right and left amygdala , and not medial prefrontal cortex , after levodopa administration .
18041716|Individuals with greater levels of trait anxiety showed delayed activation of Brodmann Area 45 in response to the fearful and happy faces , and lowered Brodmann Area 45 activation with prolonged left amygdala activation in response to the neutral faces .
18062938|The present study investigated the expression of three IEGs , arc and two transcription factors -LRB- NGFI-B and Nurr 1 -RRB- , in regions of the brain of rats that were subjected to a single afterdischarge-inducing electrical stimulation of the left amygdala and in the amygdala-kindled rats that developed consecutive generalized seizures .
18155924|The larger volume condition additionally activated left posterior amygdala , left posterior insula and the left precuneus .
18155924|The response in the left amygdala and insula was negatively associated with changes in self-reports of fullness and positively with changes in plasma ghrelin concentration , whereas those in the right amygdala and insula were negatively associated with the subject 's body mass index .
18155924|These findings provide evidence that the left amygdala and insula process interoceptive signals of fullness produced by gastric distention involved in the controls of food intake .
18158161|RESULTS : Left-greater-than-right-asymmetry of the amygdala varied as a function of gender and mood congruence of delusional beliefs , due to asymmetrical enlargement of the left amygdala in women presenting with predominantly mood incongruent delusions .
18181882|Voxel-wise analyses examined whole brain functional connectivity with the left amygdala .

22182770|All winning models share a connection from the bilateral fusiform gyrus -LRB- FFG -RRB- into the left amygdala and a non-linear modulatory influence of bilateral posterior superior temporal sulcus -LRB- pSTS -RRB- on these connections .
22182770|This result indicates that the pSTS not only integrates multi-modal information from visual and auditory regions -LRB- as reflected in our model by significant feed-forward connections -RRB- but also gates the influence of the sensory information on the left amygdala , leading to attenuation of amygdala activity when a neutral stimulus is integrated .

22450197|The greater left amygdala response to negative emotion for women accords with previous reports that women respond more strongly to negative emotional stimuli , as well as with hypothesized links between increased neurobiological reactivity to negative emotion and increased prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders in women .
22450197|The finding of greater left amygdala activation for positive emotional stimuli in men suggests that greater amygdala responses reported previously for men for specific types of positive stimuli may also extend to positive stimuli more generally .

23364872|As recently shown in healthy volunteers , dopamine storage capacity -LRB- V d -RRB- in the left amygdala was positively correlated with functional activation in the left amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- during an emotional task ; high functional connectivity between the amygdala and the ACC , a region important for emotion regulation , was associated with low trait anxiety .
23364872|Furthermore , we asked whether disrupted functional coupling between amygdala and ACC during aversive processing is related to trait anxiety.We used combined 6 - -LSB- 18F -RSB- - fluoro-l-DOPA positron emission tomography -LRB- PET -RRB- , functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- and Spielberger 's state-trait anxiety questionnaire -LRB- STAI -RRB- in 11 male detoxified alcohol-dependent patients compared to 13 matched healthy controls.Unlike healthy controls , patients showed no significant correlation between our PET metric for dopamine storage capacity -LRB- FDOPA V d -RRB- , in left amygdala and activation in left ACC .

24904065|Emotional cue-induced activation in right lateral OFC and left amygdala might relate to emotion-based risk-taking through negative urgency .
24904351|As prior studies have suggested that prefrontal regions may guide and regulate emotional memory search via functional connections with the amygdala , the current analysis focused on functional connectivity between the left amygdala and the left prefrontal cortex , and structural integrity of the uncinate fasciculus , a white matter tract connecting prefrontal and temporal regions .
24904351|Aging was associated with a significant increase in the relation between measures of structural integrity -LRB- specifically , fractional anisotropy , or FA -RRB- along the uncinate fasciculus and functional connectivity between the left ventral prefrontal cortex and amygdala during positive event retrieval , but not negative or neutral retrieval .

25142952|Exploratory analyses indicated that aggressive response generation - the tendency to respond to threat with reactive aggression - predicted left amygdala reactivity to fear faces and was concurrently associated with empathy , antisocial behavior , and hostile attributional bias , whereas hostile attributional bias correlated with IQ .
25177285|Imaging data indicated an age-related reversal within the ventromedial prefrontal/anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- VMPFC/ACC -RRB- and the left amygdala of the brain networks that were engaged in the retrieval of autobiographical events with different valence .
25180160|In contrast to the healthy volunteers , individuals with PTSD showed : -LRB- 1 -RRB- hyperactivity from amygdala , hippocampus , posterolateral orbitofrontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- , dorsomedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- dmPFC -RRB- , and insular cortex in high-frequency -LRB- i.e. , beta , gamma , and high-gamma -RRB- bands ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- hypoactivity from vmPFC , Frontal Pole -LRB- FP -RRB- , and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex -LRB- dlPFC -RRB- in high-frequency bands ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- extensive hypoactivity from dlPFC , FP , anterior temporal lobes , precuneous cortex , and sensorimotor cortex in alpha and low-frequency bands ; and -LRB- 4 -RRB- in individuals with PTSD , MEG activity in the left amygdala and posterolateral OFC correlated positively with PTSD symptom scores , whereas MEG activity in vmPFC and precuneous correlated negatively with symptom score .

25220389|Positive affect scores correlated with the betweenness values of the right orbital frontal cortex -LRB- OFC -RRB- and the right putamen in the positive emotional network ; negative affect scores correlated with the betweenness values of the left OFC and the left amygdala in the negative emotional network .
25227944|Sexual permissiveness was negatively correlated with regional gray matter density of the structures involving the right amygdala and surrounding areas , and positively correlated with regional white matter density of the white matter area that spread around the left amygdala to the hypothalamus area .
25231241|Independent of time , larger hippocampal volumes were associated with higher PA , and negative affect was associated with smaller left amygdala volume .

25298173|BACKGROUND : A differential contribution of the right and left amygdalae to affective information processing has been proposed .
25298173|In this study , we used a pre - and post-treatment -LRB- escitalopram -RRB- design to analyze the relative differences between neural activity in the right and left amygdalae during exposure to emotional stimuli in currently depressed patients .
25298173|To the best of our knowledge , this study is to compare neural activity between the left and right amygdalae in people with depression .
25298173|Amygdala responses to four types of emotional stimuli did not significantly change -LRB- p > 0.05 -RRB- with treatment in either the right or the left amygdala .
25298173|However , the difference in neural activity between the right and left amygdalae was greater after treatment , and the variation in neural activity was larger in the left amygdala .
25298173|CONCLUSIONS : We found that the response between the right and left amygdala did not differ in terms of time series , although activity increased after pharmaceutical treatment for each emotion tested .
25318546|This predictor is based on the shape diffeomorphometry patterns of subcortical and ventricular structures -LRB- left and right amygdala , hippocampus , thalamus , caudate , putamen , globus pallidus , and lateral ventricle -RRB- of 607 baseline scans from the Alzheimer 's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database , including a total of 210 healthy control subjects , 222 MCI subjects , and 175 AD subjects .
25339875|RESULTS : Left amygdala volume was larger in VFD vs. control macaques .
25339875|CONCLUSION : These data suggest that the left amygdala exhibits hypertrophy after ELS , particularly in association with the serotonin transporter gene , and that amygdala volume variation occurs in concert with other key stress-related behavioral and neurobiological parameters observed across the lifecycle .
25344944|The active and placebo groups exhibited different patterns of right and left amygdala activation with training .
25344944|Across all participants irrespective of group , individuals with greater left amygdala activation in the threat-bias contrast prior to training exhibited greater symptom reduction .
25344944|Greater left amygdala activation at baseline predicted reductions in social anxiety symptoms following ABM .
25355453|In particular , qT1 decreases in bilateral temporal lobes , right parietal lobes , basal ganglia including left putamen , left caudate nucleus and left amygdala , and left hippocampus/parahippocampus ; qT2 decreases in left putamen and increases in left precuneus .
25367022|The left amygdala was increased by 28 % and the right by 29 % , normalized to total brain volumes .
25376429|In the nonregulation block , females showed greater activation of the left amygdala and the right STG during stress than males while males recruited the putamen more robustly in this condition .
25379440|In addition , there were significant increases in grey matter volume in the left mid-insula , the right insula , left and right primary motor cortices , left premotor cortex , left hippocampus and within the brainstem and cerebellum , and significant decreases in the mPFC , occipital lobe , right posterior cingulate cortex , left cerebellar cortex and the left and right amygdala in OSA , but there was no overlap between these structural changes and the functional changes in OSA .

25530842|RESULTS : Compared with healthy controls -LRB- HCs -RRB- , AD youth exhibited hyperconnectivity between the right amygdala and the insula and hypoconnectivity between the left amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- and posterior cingulate cortex -LRB- PCC -RRB- .
25540682|Whole-brain voxel-wise findings showed symptom improvement after CBT was predicted by greater right amygdala-pregenual ACC -LRB- `` pgACC '' -RRB- connectivity and greater left amygdala-pgACC coupling encompassing medial prefrontal cortex .
25540682|In support of their predictive value , area under receiver operating characteristic curve was significant for the left and right amygdala-pgACC in relation to treatment responders .

25545969|Compared to the nondepressed PD patients , depressed PD patients showed increased left amygdala functional connectivity with the bilateral mediodorsal thalamus , right amygdala functional connectivity with the left superior temporal gyrus , and left calcarine gyrus .
25545969|Compared to the healthy controls , the depressed PD group also showed increased left amygdala functional connectivity with the bilateral mediodorsal thalamus , but decreased left amygdala functional connectivity with the left putamen , left inferior frontal gyrus , and the right cerebellum , as well as decreased right amygdala functional connectivity with the left inferior orbitofrontal gyrus , the left gyrus rectus , and the right putamen .

25605886|Asymmetrical effects of unilateral right or left amygdala damage on auditory cortical processing of vocal emotions .
25605886|Thus , unilateral amygdala damage leads to globally reduced ipsilesional cortical voice processing , but only left amygdala lesions are sufficient to suppress the enhanced auditory cortical processing of vocal emotions .
25615561|Most importantly , they showed diminished RSFC between the left amygdala and orbitofrontal as well as anterior prefrontal regions .
25623035|Extended from these previous works , this study examined the functional connectivity of the amygdala in meditation experts during affective processing and observed that these experts had significantly stronger left amygdala -LRB- LA -RRB- connectivity with the dorsal ACC -LRB- dACC -RRB- , premotor , and primary somatosensory cortices -LRB- PSC -RRB- while viewing affectively positive stimuli when compared to the novices .
25629899|However , the engagement of the left and right amygdala during the early perceptual processing of different emotional faces remains unclear .
25629899|We found that within 100 ms after stimulus onset the right amygdala habituated to emotional faces rapidly -LRB- with duration around 20-30 ms -RRB- , whereas activity in the left amygdala -LRB- with duration around 50-60 ms -RRB- sustained longer than that in the right .
25629899|Our data suggest that the right amygdala could be linked to autonomic arousal generated by facial emotions and the left amygdala might be involved in decoding or evaluating expressive faces in the early perceptual emotion processing .

26007149|In response to overt fear , BPD patients showed greater activation both in left amygdala and in several frontal cortical regions .
26017750|No correlation was found between impulsivity scores and the volume of the left amygdala .
26017750|Furthermore , the right amygdala would play a bigger role in impulsivity and behaviour control than the left amygdala .

9105578|We previously reported finding differential effects of unilateral infusion of lidocaine into the right and left amygdalae prior to a retention test 24 h after one-trial inhibitory avoidance training .
9105578|As indicated by initial response latencies on the first retention test , unilateral inactivation of either the right or the left amygdala severely impaired retention performance for the escape training regardless of the number of prior escape training trials received .
9105578|These results suggest that the differential involvement of the right and left amygdalae may be limited to certain training conditions .
9108115|Change of rCBF within the left amygdala and the left OFC was highly intercorrelated , indicating a strong functional interaction between these brain regions .
9108115|Furthermore , the activity within the left amygdala was associated significantly with subjective ratings of perceived aversiveness .
9135046|Previous studies suggest that the left and right amygdalae are interconnected in rodents .
915514|Centre median lesions alone did not impair this form of learning ; however , when combined with a left amygdala lesion a significant decrease in scores occurred which persisted for up to two years after operation .
9184662|To determine if these effects are potentiated by bilateral injections , we injected A beta -LRB- 5.0 nmol -RRB- into the left and right amygdala of young male Fischer rats .
9184662|Surprisingly , the same brain regions within the left hemisphere were significantly less affected even though no differences were observed between the left and right amygdala in the size of Congored-positive A beta deposits .
9184662|Unilateral injections of A beta into the left amygdala led to significant histological changes in the right amygdala and hippocampus , but not in the same brain regions within the left hemisphere .
9226659|Autopsy showed : previous left temporal lobectomy with absence of left amygdala and hippocampus , atrophy of fornix and mamillary body ; neuronal loss in the right hippocampus , severe in CA1 and CA4 ; intact right amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus ; recent diffuse damage associated with cause of death .
9255598|However , the T2 relaxation time of the left amygdala was > or = 111 msec -LRB- i.e. , > or = 2 S.D. over the mean T2 time of the left amygdala in control subjects -RRB- in seven -LRB- 10 % -RRB- patients , one of which was newly diagnosed and six were chronic .

9522399|Functional MRI reveals left amygdala activation during emotion .
9522399|During sad mood , blood flow increased in the left amygdala and these changes correlated with shifts towards a negative affect .
9522399|A significant increase in signal intensity was found during sad as well as happy mood induction in the left amygdala .
9527653|Mean T2 values of left amygdala were significantly higher in patients showing less favorable improvement after neuroleptic treatment in comparison to those who improved better .
9549487|In support of the first hypothesis , enhanced activity in the left amygdala , left pulvinar , left anterior insula and bilateral anterior cingulate gyri was observed during the processing of fearful faces .
9596046|Meta-analysis 2 indicated that the inclusion of the amygdala in the region of interest significantly increased effect sizes across studies -LRB- effect size for the left hippocampus and amygdala , 0.67 ; for the right , 0.72 -RRB- , whereas variables such as illness duration , total slice width , magnet strength , the use of the intracranial volume as a covariate , measurement reliability , and study quality did not .
9630260|Quantitatively , total brain and gray-matter volumes were reduced in DS , as were the volumes of the left hippocampus and amygdala ; ventricle volumes were larger .
9630260|Similarly , total brain , left hippocampus , and left amygdala volumes were reduced quantitatively in subjects with DS with dementia , while ventricular volumes were increased .
