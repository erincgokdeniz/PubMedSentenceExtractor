14757593|However , for both subgroups with PTSD , rCBF changes in medial frontal gyrus were inversely correlated with rCBF changes in the left amygdala and the right amygdala/periamygdaloid cortex .

14741673|These results are discussed in terms of the functional association between the right PFC and the amygdala and its influence on cognitive processing .

14663183|More negative interpretations of surprised faces were associated with greater signal changes in the right ventral amygdala , while more positive interpretations were associated with greater signal changes in the ventral mPFC .

14659478|Specifically , I hypothesize that the right hemisphere amygdala modulates right hemispheric processing of global/central aspects of a situation -LRB- an effect more pronounced in males -RRB- , while the left hemisphere amygdala modulates left hemispheric processing of more local/fine detail aspects of a situation -LRB- an effect more pronounced in females -RRB- .

14636318|Female Wistar rats were implanted in the right basolateral amygdala with a long-term , bipolar electrode .

14614086|Our results provide support for the hypothesis that the left and right amygdalae subserve different functions in emotion processing : the left may decode the arousal signaled by the specific stimulus , whereas the right may provide a global level of autonomic activation triggered automatically by any arousing stimulus .

14609882|Region of interest correlations showed that only patients with schizophrenia lacked a positive correlation between left temporal pole and left anterior amygdala-hippocampal complex gray matter volumes , whereas both psychosis groups were similar in lacking normal positive correlations between left temporal pole and left anterior superior temporal gyrus gray matter volumes .

12667853|Correspondence between increased intensity of predominantly left sided amygdala activation and self-rating of sadness was found in 78 % of 120 sad trials , in contrast to only 14 % of neutral trials .

12595192|Gradient compensation increased effective T -LRB- 2 -RRB- * values in left and right amygdala on average by 18.8 + / - 7.5 ms , while maintaining sensitivity in uncompensated brain areas .

12552033|The mean total volumes of the right and left hippocampal formations and amygdala did not differ significantly between any of the three groups .

12383242|For the kindling experiments , electrodes were surgically implanted in the left basolateral amygdala and were stimulated daily at the afterdischarge threshold until a criterion of three consecutive stage 5 seizures was reached .

12167256|In the first study , we examined the effects of amygdala lesions on affective traits in 10 left and 10 right amygdala-damaged patients , 1 patient with bilateral amygdala damage -LRB- SP -RRB- , and 20 control subjects .

12165365|In this MR study we used a 3D shape representation technique , based on spherical harmonic functions , to analyze left and right amygdala-hippocampus shapes in each of 15 patients with schizophrenia and 15 healthy controls matched for age , gender , handedness and parental socioeconomic status .

12105126|No differences were found between the left and right amygdala .

12086710|We carried out a systematic review of the published literature reporting left and right amygdala volumes from MRI in non-clinical subjects .

11801297|Predator stress appeared to potentiate right and depotentiate left hemisphere afferent amygdala transmission .

11801297|Potentiation in left hemisphere amygdala afferents and efferents predicts anxiolytic-like effects , while potentiation in the right hemisphere amygdala afferents predicts anxiogenic-like effects .

11784442|These results may suggest that the left and right amygdalae play a differential role in effective processing of facial expressions in collaboration with other cortical or subcortical regions , with the left being related with the bilateral prefrontal cortex , and the right with the right temporal lobe .

11773432|The amygdala is involved in the normal facilitation of memory by emotion , but the separate contributions of the left and right amygdala to memory for verbal or nonverbal emotional material have not been investigated .

11772693|For Down 's syndrome , smaller volumes of the right and left amygdala , hippocampus , and posterior parahippocampal gyrus were significantly associated with greater age ; this association was not seen in the anterior parahippocampal gyrus .

11568425|The available evidence allows one to conclude that there is definitely a hemisphere specific processing difference between the left and right amygdala .

11513822|A region-of-interest analysis demonstrated differential change in BOLD signal in the right but not left amygdala across CS + versus CS - viewing .

11496145|Happy faces produced greater right than left amygdala activation for males but not females .

11494576|We obtained magnetic resonance -LRB- MR -RRB- spectra of the left and right amygdaloid-hippocampal regions and the left cerebellar hemisphere with a STEAM sequence -LRB- TR = 5000 ms , TE = 18 ms -RRB- .

11473792|The present study applied a visual half field paradigm with emotional facial expressions in patients with selective unilateral amygdalo-hippocampectomy -LRB- AHE -RRB- to elucidate the contributions of the left and right medial temporal lobe and amygdala to emotional learning .

11467919|Right neostriatum and left amygdala were activated when subjects made explicit judgements of disgust , bilateral orbitofrontal cortex when they made judgement of happiness , and right frontal and insular cortex when they made judgements about any emotion .

11357132|Examination of patients with either left or right amygdala resections shows that the enhanced perception of aversive words depends specifically on the left amygdala .

11296093|Compared with the neutral imagery control condition , imagery-induced drug craving was associated with bilateral -LRB- right hemisphere amygdala activation greater than left -RRB- activation of the amygdala , the left insula and anterior cingulate gyrus , and the right subcallosal gyrus and nucleus accumbens area .

11312562|The right and left basolateral amygdala and right frontal cortex were implanted with concentric bipolar electrodes .

11287374|Based on these task and behavioural effects , we examined functional connectivity of the right prefrontal cortex and left amygdala in both groups by determining those areas whose activity was correlated with activity in these regions .

11241871|Time courses of left and right amygdalar responses to fearful facial expressions . .

11241871|Despite the many studies highlighting the role of the amygdala in fear perception , few have examined differences between right and left amygdalar responses .

11241871|Initial observation of extracted time series of both amygdalae to these stimuli indicated more rapid decreases of right than left amygdalar responses to fearful faces , and increasing magnitudes of right amygdalar responses to neutral faces with time .

11241871|There was more significant nonstationarity of right than left amygdalar responses to neutral , and left than right amygdalar responses to fearful faces .

11241871|These findings indicate significant variability over time of both right and left amygdalar responses to fearful and neutral facial expressions and are the first demonstration of specific differences in time courses of right and left amygdalar responses to these stimuli .

10978480|Effects of baseline anxiety on response to kindling of the right medial amygdala . .

10978480|The effects of kindling of the right anterior medial amygdala of Wistar rats was studied .

10958248|A new finding is that increased local excitability in the right basal amygdala -LRB- reduced threshold for evoked response -RRB- , and LTP in the right amygdalo-PAG pathway , may be important for maintenance of increases in defensive behavior .

10913507|Right and total amygdala volumes were significantly larger in generalized anxiety disorder subjects .

10891648|During the task , activation of the right anterior medial temporal region including the amygdala was increased in the psychogenic amnesic patient .

10837507|However , several issues remain poorly understood : the separate roles of left and right amygdala , the time course over which the amygdala participates in memory consolidation , and the type of knowledge structures it helps consolidate .

10771248|KA was infused into the left basolateral amygdaloid nucleus and focal limbic seizures were induced in 43 male Wistar rats .

10727625|On PD35 , concentrations of DA in the bilateral lateral amygdala and HVA in the left lateral amygdala were significantly increased in lesioned rats compared with sham-operated animals , while no significant change was observed in the other three brain areas .

10727625|On PD56 , in addition to the increased concentration of DA in the left lateral amygdala , those of DA , DOPAC and HVA in the caudate-putamen , and DA in the nucleus accumbens were found to be increased , but DA concentrations in the right medial prefrontal cortex were decreased .

10683842|Repeated visual stimulation resulted in neural habituation bilaterally in the secondary visual cortex and in the right medial temporal cortex including the amygdala and the hippocampus .

10683827|Matching angry or frightened expressions was associated with increased regional cerebral blood flow -LRB- rCBF -RRB- in the left and right amygdala , the brain 's primary fear centers .

10648432|Another subgroup of aggressive patients -LRB- 28 % -RRB- had different left temporal lesions affecting either the amygdala or periamygdaloid structures .

10624542|There was a highly significant enlargement of left and right amygdala volumes in patients with dysthymia -LRB- right side , p < .000 ; left side , p = .001 -RRB- .

10619632|Greater serotonin in the right versus left amygdala relates to greater anxiety .

10618008|Relative to the cerebral volume differences , the regional volumes of the subjects with schizophrenia were 94 % in the left and right amygdala , 94 % in the left and 95 % in the right hippocampus/amygdala , and 93 % in the left and 95 % in the right parahippocampus .

10581226|Furthermore , the comparison of abstract and concrete words indicated that abstract word processing was associated with selective activations -LRB- right temporal pole and amygdala , bilateral inferior frontal cortex -RRB- , while no brain areas were more active in response to concrete words .

10561935|Significant associations were found between left hippocampal volume and the immediate , delayed , and percent retention scores of the Logical Memory Test ; between the left mammillary body volume and the Logical Memory Test delayed and percent retention scores ; immediate Visual Reproduction performance was significantly related to the right and left amygdala volumes , and right mammillary body volume ; only the right amygdala and right mammillary body volume were associated with the delayed Visual Reproduction trial .

10517953|Similarly , DA alterations also were greater in the left medial amygdala in response to stressors .

10510979|Bipolar nichrome stimulation and recording electrodes were stereotaxically implanted into the right and left basolateral amygdala .

10420552|In females , an increase in 5-HT level was found in the left and right amygdalas in response to irrelevant stimulus .

10330702|Predominant activation of the right hippocampus and right amygdala during perception and memorizing of visual picturesque images and solving the tasks provoking emotional stress , apparently , concerns the functional specialization of the right hemisphere in general .

10073475|In contrast , NMDA receptors in the left lateral amygdala mediate lasting suppression of risk assessment .

10073475|MK-801 , in a variety of sites in the left but not right lateral amygdala , blocked the effects of predator stress on risk assessment .

10073475|The data indicate that integrity of the left lateral amygdala is necessary for potentiation of startle amplitude by predator stress , though NMDA receptors are not involved in this function .

10073475|Nevertheless , NMDA receptors in the right , but not the left lateral amygdala , mediate initiation of changes in startle .

9829819|Autopsy revealed severe atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes , remarkable neuronal loss and gliosis in the precentral gyrus , left temporal lobe pole and amygdala , mild degeneration of the Ammon 's horn , degeneration of the corticospinal tract , and very mild involvement of the lower motor neurons .

9826730|No correlation was found between activity of either the left or right amygdala and recall .

9808311|In our mainly right-handed normals , the right HC and amygdala were on average 0.05 and 0.03 ml larger respectively than on the left .

9766770|The schizophrenic patients also showed a smaller gray matter volume of the left posterior amygdala-hippocampal complex than the comparison subjects .

9766770|Both the patients with schizophrenia and those with affective psychosis had significant left-less-than-right asymmetry of the posterior amygdala-hippocampal complex .

9748604|We stimulated the left amygdala of rats to produce amygdaloid kindling .

9630260|Quantitatively , total brain and gray-matter volumes were reduced in DS , as were the volumes of the left hippocampus and amygdala ; ventricle volumes were larger .

9596046|Meta-analysis 2 indicated that the inclusion of the amygdala in the region of interest significantly increased effect sizes across studies -LRB- effect size for the left hippocampus and amygdala , 0.67 ; for the right , 0.72 -RRB- , whereas variables such as illness duration , total slice width , magnet strength , the use of the intracranial volume as a covariate , measurement reliability , and study quality did not .

9461057|A beta also induced reactive astrocytosis and neuronal shrinkage within the right hippocampus and amygdala , respectively .

9267774|Bradycardia induced from stimulation of the left versus right central nucleus of the amygdala . .

9226659|Autopsy showed : previous left temporal lobectomy with absence of left amygdala and hippocampus , atrophy of fornix and mamillary body ; neuronal loss in the right hippocampus , severe in CA1 and CA4 ; intact right amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus ; recent diffuse damage associated with cause of death .

9184662|To determine if these effects are potentiated by bilateral injections , we injected A beta -LRB- 5.0 nmol -RRB- into the left and right amygdala of young male Fischer rats .

9184662|Surprisingly , the same brain regions within the left hemisphere were significantly less affected even though no differences were observed between the left and right amygdala in the size of Congored-positive A beta deposits .

9105578|We previously reported finding differential effects of unilateral infusion of lidocaine into the right and left amygdalae prior to a retention test 24 h after one-trial inhibitory avoidance training .

9105578|As indicated by initial response latencies on the first retention test , unilateral inactivation of either the right or the left amygdala severely impaired retention performance for the escape training regardless of the number of prior escape training trials received .

9105578|These results suggest that the differential involvement of the right and left amygdalae may be limited to certain training conditions .

9135046|Previous studies suggest that the left and right amygdalae are interconnected in rodents .

8988790|Additionally , left anterior STG and right amygdala were smaller than predicted in schizophrenia but not bipolar disorder .

8891302|Male Wistar rats received electrodes into the right basolateral amygdala and were subsequently kindled until fully generalized seizures could be elicited .

8738274|A single dose of ORG 2766 -LRB- 1 ng/1 microliter -RRB- injected into the left central amygdaloid nucleus 30 min before the NMDA-injection was equally effective in reducing the increase in locomotion .

7576208|Unilateral infusions of lidocaine into the right or left amygdala did not affect acquisition .

7576208|The findings are consistent with others indicating involvement of the amygdala in acquisition and consolidation of aversively motivated learning and suggest possible differential involvement of the right and left amygdalae in memory consolidation .

7633882|In this study , we investigated the effect of kindling from the left amygdala on PKC activities in the amygdala/pyriform cortex and hippocampus at long seizure-free intervals -LRB- 4 and 16 weeks -RRB- from the last amygdala-kindled seizure .

7633882|There was no significant alteration in the membrane-associated PKC activity of the kindled group in the right hippocampus or amygdala/pyriform cortex in any seizure-free interval after the last amygdala seizure .

7796168|Muscimol injected into the right or left amygdaloid complex differentially affects retention performance following aversively motivated training . .

7796168|These results suggest differential involvement of the right and left amygdala in memory .

7719727|Differential involvement of the right and left amygdalae in expression of memory for aversively motivated training . .

7719727|These results suggest that the right and left amygdalae may make differential contributions to the expression of memory , and that the contribution of the right amygdala may be more important to the expression of memory for aversively motivated training .

8535852|The estral index diminished in almost all animals with a lesion in the right side of medial amygdala .

8535852|Lesions of the right medial amygdala , when performed on diestrus-1 , resulted in a significant decrease in the number of rats ovulating compared to controls -LRB- 4/8 vs. 8/8 , p < 0.05 -RRB- .

8417581|Both schizophrenic subgroups had larger left caudate volumes and smaller right and left amygdala/hippocampus complex volumes than the normal subjects .

1751619|Only in the schizophrenic group was P300 latency correlated negatively with the area of the right and left cingulate cortex and positively with the difference in size between the right and left amygdala .

1751619|In the subgroup of schizophrenic subjects whose P300 latency was greater than 2 standard deviations above the control mean , the area of the left cingulate cortex was significantly smaller than in controls , and the absolute right-left difference in the area of the amygdala was significantly increased .
