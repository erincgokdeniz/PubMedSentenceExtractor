23395233|Furthermore , an f-MRI study shows that mood stabilizers can reduce amygdala activation of bipolar patients compared to untreated bipolar patients during an emotional task .

23418586|This decrease was significantly correlated with activation of the left amygdala and deterioration of subjective mood state .

22826810|This review presents data supporting the potential therapeutic role of DBS of the amygdala in the treatment of anxiety disorders , addiction , and mood disorders .

22737116|Alternatively , it is proposed that schizophrenia arises from a uniquely human brain network associated with directed effort including the dorsal anterior and posterior cingulate cortex -LRB- PCC -RRB- , auditory cortex , and hippocampus while mood disorders arise from a different brain network associated with emotional encoding including the ventral anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- ACC -RRB- , orbital frontal cortex , and amygdala .

22716999|Our results suggest that short-term SSRI treatment in depressed patients remediates amygdala hyperactivity in response to negative emotional stimuli prior to clinical improvement in depressed mood .

22631618|These investigations reveal that amygdala activation varies as a function of mood state , while the PFC remains persistently hypoactivated across mood states .

22521854|Here we examined whether similar mood state-dependent volumetric differences are detectable in the amygdala .

22521854|Statistical analyses found a significant effect of mood state and hemisphere on amygdala volume .

22521854|Our results suggest that mood state influences amygdala volume in subjects with bipolar disorder .

22487247|The amygdala is fundamental in expression of emotion , and is hyperactive in many patients with mood or anxiety disorders .

22483075|Moreover , the severity of current depressed mood was associated with increased activity in limbic regions , such as the amygdala , particularly in children with a history of depression .

22444599|Neurobiological abnormalities that correlate with the number of mood episodes or duration of illness include : anatomical , functional , and biochemical deficits in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus , as well as amygdala hyperactivity and cortisol hyper-secretion .

21943083|We examined how individual differences in mood and anxiety in the early postpartum period are related to brain response to infant stimuli during fMRI , with particular focus on regions implicated in both maternal behavior and mood/anxiety , that is , the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex -LRB- sgACC -RRB- and the amygdala .

21912391|We focused on the lateral/basolateral/basomedian complex of the amygdala as a neural hub of mood regulation affected in MDD .

21895344|During the mood induction , high-risk girls exhibited greater activation than did low-risk daughters in brain areas that have frequently been implicated in the experience of negative affect , including the amygdala and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex .

21861822|The heterogeneity of mood disorders indicates that its origin may lie in dysfunction of multiple brain regions -LRB- amygdala , nucleus accumbens , hippocampus , prefrontal cortex and cingulate cortex -RRB- .

21807003|The amygdala and the prefrontal cortex , brain regions involved in anxiety and fear , mood , cognitive function and behavioral control , also show structural plasticity .

21788943|One prominent theoretical perspective highlights the top-down inhibition of amygdala by ventromedial prefrontal cortex -LRB- vmPFC -RRB- as a crucial neural mechanism that may be defective in certain mood and anxiety disorders , such as major depression and post-traumatic stress disorder .

21741179|Indeed , in mood disorders -LRB- unipolar depression , anxiety disorders , autism or schizophrenia -RRB- glial changes in brain regions involved in mood control -LRB- prefrontal and cingulate cortices , amygdala and the hippocampus -RRB- have been recurrently described .

21716262|The expression of the galanin gene -LRB- GAL -RRB- in the paraventricular nucleus -LRB- PVN -RRB- and in the amygdala of higher vertebrates suggests the requirement for highly conserved , but unidentified , regulatory sequences that are critical to allow the galanin gene to control alcohol and fat intake and modulate mood .

21640839|Despite no differences in mood across the three groups , we found reduced connectivity between the amygdala and the ventral medial prefrontal cortex in the citalopram group and the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex for the reboxetine group .

21616602|In addition , elevated CRF in cerebrospinal fluid is observed in mood and anxiety disorder patients , suggesting that CRF is also being overproduced from extrahypothalamic sources such as the central amygdala -LRB- CeA -RRB- and overactivity of the amygdala in neuroimaging studies is a consistent finding in anxiety and depression patients .

21371560|Behavioral results confirm an MCM bias while imaging results show amygdala and hippocampal engagement in a global mood and successful recall , respectively .

21320248|Limbic structures were not overactive in association with mood states , with the exception of increased amygdala activation in euthymic states when including region-of-interest studies .

22432455|These findings suggest that increased functional integration of the amygdala within the frontolimbic network might be a biomarker of general mood stabilizer medication responsivity in bipolar disorder .

20946960|The modulation of the left amygdala responses by subjective experience may reflect individual differences in the cognitive effort used to induce the mood .

20946960|Thus , the central role of the amygdala may not be restricted to the perception of emotion in others but also extend into processes involved in regulation of mood .

20712756|Several magnetic resonance imaging studies have found changes in amygdala volumes in adults with mood disorders .
